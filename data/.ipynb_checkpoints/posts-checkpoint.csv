Any anti-abortion parody site out there?,"I was imagining an anti-abortion parody website, menagainstabortion.org or something similar, under two sections:

Women's rights:

That section of the site would look like a genuine anti-abortion website, trying to put the most compassionate spin on how anti-abortion advocates care for women's rights.

Men's rights:

This section of the site would be the parody portion, defending a man's legal freedom to fornicate and fervently opposing any law that could restrict that freedom while also insisting that no link exists between male promiscuity and abortion whatsoever. After all, it's the women's responsibility to ensure that condoms work properly, and too bad that rape is so difficult to prove. But men need some fun now and then eh?

Right to life argument is missing a next of kin?,"So, I either thought of this or read it. I probably read it (if I'm stealing your idea, I'm sry &amp; give yourself credit in a comment). The framework of right to life that PLers love to throw around is missing a key detail. See, all born humans have a right to life. When a born human can't make their own medical decisions, the default is that their closest next-of-kin will make all medical decisions on their behalf. Including life-or-death decisions. Therefore, as the pregnant person I would be the (literally) closest next of kin to the unborn physically within my body using it for life support. 

What about the father? Let's say he has 50% say over the child, but it's still my body and that's 100% up to me, making the net decision 25% dad and 75% me, which makes me the deciding vote, so this was pointless math.

Oh PLer don't like math cuz it hard? PLer wanna talk about custody? It's in the body of the pregnant person, so they have full custody and it's completely their decision. Congratulations: you've upgraded my deciding power from 75% to 100%. That was also pointless. (plus what if the father wants an abortion to? What you gonna say about them apples PLer?)

Has anyone tried that sort of counter argument before with them? The next-of-kin part? I mean, I know anything this simple will not change their minds. I assume they might respond with something like ""wanting to kill you child means you aren't fit to be a mother"" to which I would be like ""ok, then take it away from me"" Or probably do their ""but you can't!!!"" routine, as if their emotions bend the very fabric of reality and force all known abortion options out of existence, including the ones that have existed through out all/most of human history. 

It's just seeing it with this next of kin thing really made them look (like a new flavor of) totally crazy that they think it should be up to themselves or the government, when next of kin people are making life or death decisions for their family members every single day (including stuff like taking them off life support), and parents making all medical decisions for children is normal (especially life or death ones). The government and random strangers almost never get involved. It makes PLers look like someone running around the ICU with a sign that says ""don't murder your grandma"" (which I'm pretty sure security would force them to leave for). 

I personally won't be using this argument because I'm done listening to their garbage. My dog knows more about basic common decency than every PLer I've talked to combined, and even she doesn't get say over my life (cuz she's a dog).

Side note: anyone ever gotten the ""but you can't!"" response and decided to be a total smart-ass by replying with basically the ""idk, can you?"" routine teachers love, as in can = physically possible while may = permission (so legality?). Like has anyone ever decided to be that much of a troll and pointed out how ""you can't!"" is a false statement because it is physically possible? Yes I know that doesn't further productive conversation, neither does anything they say to me. 

To be clear: I personally am of the opinion that right to life starts at birth, my mind just had a little look at the framework itself and in my opinion, there's some holes in it. This did not cause surprise to me though.",t2_xy1g2,1645534501,prochoice

Anti-choicers stand for enslavement,"^((I made a rather giant sticky post 2 weeks ago about the chasm within the mainstream rhetoric around abortion rights and how it is lacking in discussing the morality of abortion rights and the immoral human rights abuses committed by anti-choicers. It didn't gain much traction and I suspect it was due to its length. So I am going to release the topics 1 by 1 as their own posts. This particular post includes added remarks into the original post - which have been italicized - as well as an added segment at the end.))

Enslavement, aka Reproductive Enslavement, Gestational Enslavement, Involuntary Reproductive Servitude, or Involuntary Gestational Servitude.

Abortion bans are a form of enslavement and violate anti-slavery laws and the 13th Amendment. When someone is denied the right to end their pregnancy, they have no legal choices left. They are faced with the inevitable outcome of continuing the pregnancy. The pregnancy may end naturally, but this is not something that the person can choose. And for the majority of people, it will inevitable end with them giving birth. And they will not have chosen this.

A anti-choice rebuttal to this might be to compare abortion to slavery. That we once let slavery be legal even though it was wrong and so too will it be with abortion. That abortion denies the personhood of the zef in the same way that POC were denied personhood.

*To make this argument is to ignore that forced impregnation, pregnancy and birth were the backbone of the slave trade. Chattel slavery did not exist without forced pregnancy and birth. It could not exist without the exploitation of the biological processes of the pregnant person's human body as well as the exploitation of the resultant child. And one cannot ignore the connection between the anti-abortion businesses and the adoption businesses that wreak of legal human trafficking.*

Abortion bans are, in fact, what denies people their personhood. They take a fetocentric view here and completely ignore the reality of what they are doing to pregnant people. The idea that they would align themselves with abolitionists while literally condoning slavery, is laughable and highlights either a potential issue with logical consistency or an attempt to obscure their dehumanization of pregnant people.

Another rebuttal to this might be: ""we aren't forcing anyone to become pregnant."" And while this may be correct, they are absolutely forcing someone to *remain* pregnant. Preventing someone from withdrawing consent, is *force.* We have options available to us to end our pregnancies. Blocking access to them forces someone to remain pregnant. The dodge of accepting that shows that they do not find it ethical to be associated with the idea of forcing continued pregnancy. I have no problem saying that not letting people in need of an organ donation forcibly take other people's organs against their will, forces that person to remain sick and inevitably die. This is not ethically problematic to me.

Denying that women are being treated as less than human while taking away their basic human rights is not something that aligns with the view of them being human. Secondly, if pregnant people are, in fact, of equal concern, then their concern for the zef should be accompanied by equal concern for the harm the pregnant person faces. And at the very least, this would include admitting that they are being harmed by pregnancy and enslaved through state abortion bans. To selectively deny the grievous bodily harm that is done to one but not the other, especially when forced, is a form of subjugating one of them. Their pain and the harm they endure isn't even acknowledged. To marginalize a person's suffering or deny their harm altogether is egregious behavior not synonymous with a view of equality. Either they find it unethical to be associated with that concept or they logically cannot follow it. Both show further fetocentric thinking and further dehumanize pregnant people. And neither point to a competent person who should be making decisions about the intimate body parts, health, and well being of others.

*“If you’re drafted into the army, the other situation in which the state seizes control of your body, at least you get three meals a day, clothing, and a place to sleep,” she said. “So, if you’re going to do that to women, pay up.”* Source: [FORCING WOMEN TO HAVE CHILDREN THEY CAN’T AFFORD IS A FORM OF SLAVERY](https://earthwithoutpoverty.com/2020/04/30/forcing-women-to-have-children-they-cant-afford-is-a-form-of-slavery/)

*This quote helps people to see that even in the army where one is drafted and consigned to involuntary servitude, they are at least given basic accommodations. Abortion bans don't even meet that standard - instead, they force pregnant people to shoulder all of the burden of costs, from healthcare, to parenting. Providing these benefits would not absolve them of their wrong doing, but is rather meant to highlight the lack of parallel political agendas that refuse to meet basic needs that come from the political party that wields abortion bans as a weapon. One need only look at what parallel agendas they do have to see further exploitation of this issue and the people it will affect: things such as a push for adoption that results in the bodily exploitation of people in poverty and makes infants into commodities to be purchased, capitalist strengthening that will leave people in poverty, and religious liberty for some while excluding the voices of religious prochoice advocates.*

*----*

People can be enslaved for being a racial minority as well as for their biological sex. As showcased above, female minorities can and were enslaved for both. 

There are some objections to the idea that abortion bans are equivalent to slavery due to the fact of **duration** \- slavery was a life long condition whereas pregnancy is of limited duration - and **choice** \- where the enslaved person had no choice while the pregnant person did have some choice.

On the issue of **duration**:   
First, we must remember that some enslaved people were freed - that does not mean that they were never enslaved just because it didn't last a life time. 

Second, even though the physical duration is temporary, the physical and psychological consequences can be lifelong. (Thank you to u/Abortionsselfdefense for bringing these two points to my attention.)

Third, we are subject to the will of a society that denies us our bodily rights. **This does not just happen in pregnancy.** It happens at all times of an afab's life - we are denied our right to our bodies because we are denied the right to engage in consensual sex (singling out our desired form of sex: PIV sex which is of most relevance to a person who would have need for abortion rights) unless we ***conform to the wishes of society.*** Afab must either consume hormonal contraceptives, sterilize themselves, or use other forms of contraceptives and, regardless if they do or not, **they must subject themselves to the outcome of a continued pregnancy** \- all of these are violations of bodily autonomy and our human right to them.

*Or* they must abstain fully from the act - another violation of their bodily autonomy and in fact, **a denial of their humanity.** They are treated as less than a full person - unable to engage in a consensual sexual act that is of benefit to their health and well being - unless they conform to society's compelled reproductive outcomes. Our sexuality is something intrinsic to us and is valid ***on it's own****,* separate from our wishes in regards to pregnancy. This also compels all people afab to continue a pregnancy in the event of a rape. And this treatment starts from the time of our birth - this ideology is ingrained in us as children. And this leads to other aspects of the socially acceptable ""womanly gender role."" She must always be open to being in servitude to her children. And this will carry on well beyond her reproductive years.

The imposition of abortion bans effects our entire life. It is not, in fact, of limited duration. It fully encompasses us in our social role and pinnacles at the moment of pregnancy. Our constant conformity is a requirement of our social standing when said society enacts abortion bans. This type of control has permeated our history of the subjugation of women. It has been seen in forced, arranged marriages, purity culture, sexual shaming and telling children they must wait until marriage to have sex. The pushing of the idea that her husband owns her and has exclusive rights to her body where we see stoning of people who ""commit"" adultery or worse, who are raped. Her husband must have exclusive access to her body and for what exactly? The bearing of children. So his children can be assured are his and his legacy and property are passed down to his legitimate heirs. Her vagina belongs to her husband, and how, her uterus belongs to her children.

Abortion bans have always gone hand in hand with controlling the reproductive organs of afab. If Roe is overturned, the legal precedent that it was founded on - Connecticut vs Griswold - will be up for toppling. And upon said bans, we will see more prosecution of miscarriage - as it stands now, the only means of prosecution is if people were engaging in illegal activity at the time of miscarriage, such as using drugs. And currently, abortion rights have insulated us from miscarriage prosecution.

On the issue of **choice**:  
There is some inherent misogyny lurking within this argument. Because, ***what exactly do we have a choice over?*** We don't choose which reproductive organs we are born with. Pregnancy is a biological process. I no more control it than I control my digestion. Once food is swallowed, it's fully automated. So this is positing that what we have control over *is our ability to have sex and our ability to use birth control.* I touch upon why this line of thinking is problematic above as well as in my segment on Reproductive Coercion from the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/sl4hcx/mainstream_abortion_rights_rhetoric_needs_to/). But for now, I would leave you with this thought: in a car accident, the person who is hit isn't blamed on the basis of their choice to have gone for a drive. We don't tell people it is their fault and they should have just not gone driving. To do so would be to claim no one has a right to be driving ever. And, in fact, this is just merely on the topic of a *privilege*, let alone *a human right.*",t2_6gi7y,1645312754,prochoice

Questioning Motherhood,"Hello, I’m not sure how to start this, but I need some guidance and advice. I, 28F, may be pregnant. 

I have taken 2 tests already and they have come back negative. But my period is late this month. On one of the tests I could swear I almost see the ghost of a second line, but it appeared maybe 30 minutes later. I’ve had no morning sickness or cramps (aside the one from my left ovary). I have always had a history of heavy/ large clotting and severe cramps. But if I am, it’s probably too early to tell. 

I am a college graduate in the field I love, engaged to the man of my dreams. We are still looking for a place of our own (my parents have let me stay and save money, me paying my own bills and helping them). Despite all of this, I am having severe internal panic. My older sister became pregnant at 19, and my Mom was understandably upset. This isn’t to say I judged my sister. I loved her and just wanted her to feel secure, so I helped raise my nephew. That was 9 years ago, she has a happy and healthy family and great career. 

My Mom never relented in her remarks, though. At each pregnancy announcement, she was so sour. Even after they were established and settled. My younger sister has been trying with her husband for a child, they have been told there are some genetic incompatibilities that would make conception difficult. One seemed to have stuck and I was so happy for her. When she told my mother, she complained how it conflicted with a family vacation coming up. I actively worked to cancel out her negativity and told my little sister to enjoy it and that I would be here if she needed anything at all. Sadly, she miscarried a week later. They are taking a break from trying for a bit, understandably. 

I tell you this because, first hand for 9 years I saw that becoming pregnant was a negative experience if not a shameful one. Even if you were married and made all of the money in the world. Like the child was not sinful, but the mother would forever be. It’s so twisted that I became afraid of ever getting pregnant. 

But that possibility is here now. I sat down and spoke with my fiancé, who held me while I cried and told me he would support me no matter what.

The Online Battle,"Not like the internet has ever been a friendly field for people of differences to come together and agree. Sometimes it's just so difficult to get through to people it feels like you're talking to a wall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a set of points or questions that have helped them successfully argue with a pro-lifer?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I once got someone to claim, not that I agree obv, that all human life is important from conception till death. After that, I asked them that if human life was so inviolable, should we save dying patients against their will. Then they said no, it should be the patient's choice, and likewise, since the baby has no choice, we should let them live. So I then I asked that if a child's on a ventilator (in a coma for maybe forever), and a doctor approaches the parents about whether they want to pull the plug or not, is that unethical? Or should there be a law saying the kid should be left on the ventilator indefinitely? After that, the discussion dissolved and my ""companion"" stopped wanting to follow my line of inquiry. Wish the discussion had gone further---I mean how good can an argument be if it drives people away?---though maybe you see what I was starting to get at (and why my ""companion"" decided to jump ship).

Growing up in Bangladesh in the 1980s, where the concept of women’s healthcare hardly existed, she understood how lucky she was to access the best in the world. But she couldn’t have been more wrong. Things started to go awry from the minute she stepped in the hospital, and after thirty hours of labor (two of which she spent pushing), Hossain’s epidural slipped. Her pain was so severe that she ran a fever of 104 degrees, and as she shook and trembled uncontrollably, the doctors finally performed an emergency C-section.""*

I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.

Thought experiment/proposal,"So I had a weird thought after seeing yet another video of ""pro-life"" people yelling terrible things at women going into planned parenthoods.

What if a planned parenthood did the following in experiment: (Hard to explain bear with me, and I don't know if this would be legal) 

2 parts. Outside, put out a tent where a person can sign up to ""save a fetus"" They can put their name on a list to ""save"" a fetus. Inside a woman coming in for an abortion can put her name on a list to potentially match with some one from the outside. 

If a woman coming to an abortion puts her name down, and before she comes in for her actual appointment (usually those don't happen on the same day) someone from the outside put in their name in, they will match. And she can choose to either go through with the abortion, or to go with the ""save"" match.

Here is the catch. (you would need lawyer help to make all this legally binding) When the person on the outside signs up to ""save"" they legally agree that if they match with a woman planning to get an abortion and she agrees to go with the ""save match"" instead they will: Pay for all prenatal, labor and post natal care. (That the woman's insurance doesn't cover) Support the woman's life style during pregnancy (and after until she can return to her previous life style) if she looses her income or otherwise cannot work due to pregnancy. Education reimbursement if she has to miss or postpone semesters etc. Pay for hired help or help themselves if the woman needs at home care. Any medical complications that happen during the whole process. (Anything else I may not be listing here) AND they adopt the baby afterwards.

My guess is, the list inside (for women getting abortions) will almost always have names on it. Like I would be willing to bet the grand majority excluding rape/incest/medical/abuse/cant-have-relatives-finding out cases would at least sign up to see if they match with some one. Meanwhile almost no ""pro-lifer"" would sign up. And even if they did, they would try to back out as soon as there are any complications.

I’m upset.,"It blows my mind that more people have died from covid than there were abortions given in the past couple of years. People would rather save a child that hasn’t seen the light of day yet, in a women who doesn’t want to carry, rather than saving their own loved ones who could have caught or carried covid. 

It blows my mind that you can kill an intruder in your house, but you can’t kill something living in your own body. 

It blows my mind that people don’t see the suffering women go through with abortions, they just see a baby with no value to life yet, has died. Regardless the reason for the abortion, the women who made that choice is fully aware of what they are giving up cause women are told their who lives that they are made to carry children so we have to have children. We are born mothers and we die mothers. 

Think about it. If you force a women to have a child, that women is either going to have to raise it, or put it up for adoption. Those are her two choices after abortion. Adoption may sounds easy and a reasonable solution, however, it’s not as easy of a process as it could be. However, there are plenty of women who do go that route, who can go that route, and feel okay going through pregnancy. That doesn’t help the women who have a child and is forced to keep it because of her friends or family told her so. Or women are forced to become pregnant at an early age because that’s how it use to be, you graduate HS, get a job, a spouse, a house, get married and have kids by the age 25. Even back then, women were forced into parent hood when they aren’t ready or didn’t want kids in the first place, and it was normal. OR she is physically or mentally incapable of having a child, could you imagine being incredible depressed your whole life, then postpartum syndrome kicks in? 

I also want to point out the male’s view of not having children. Not being ready to raise a child. Not wanting a child in the first place. Not knowing he is a father until the child’s born? Wtf. The pressure men go through of being a father. They hold the house up, keep the car running, put food on the table, build 3 treehouses in two days. Or knowing all to well of his own habits and raises the child anyway cause he has no other choice. 

It makes me so upset that people think it’s okay to use religion to support their side of the debate. The only time religion should be debated, is in comparison with other religions on spiritual beliefs. Religion isn’t a set of rules to abide by your entire life, they are guilds lines to what could make you a better person in your own way. No where in the Bible does it say, control the people around you. The Bible says, the the right love in hand eliminates any fear already in place. Women who have abortions are fearful. Fearful of the date rape they had and what this child is going to be like if the father turned out like that. Fearful of the abusive father. Fearful of her abusive self. Fearful of not having the father by her side. Fearful of not know who the father is. Fearful of not finding anybody they can trust to take their baby. Fearful of what her body is about to go through. Fearful of the scars that will be there for the rest of her life. Fearful of health issues that could possibly kill her with out warning. Fearful she won’t live up to what her family expects of her. Fearful she won’t live up to the child’s exceptions she’s currently carrying.  Fearful of losing who she was as a person, and becoming a mother. 

Parenthood is no joke. No one is 100% mentally stable all of the time. No one is 100% healthy all of the time. No one is 100% financially stable all of the time. We all could at least agree the right should be, that having a child should be at the time when the human being is ready to raise a child in their own terms. Not when society tells you to.",t2_3swqbdx4,1644594788,prochoice
What It’s Like to Have A Second-Trimester Abortion," Georgia passed its version of a “heartbeat bill,” legislation that bans abortion after six weeks of gestation. The bill — like other anti-abortion bills that cleared statehouses across the South and the Midwest this year — sparked protests, condemnation from doctors and advocates, and legal challenges.  But for some women in Georgia, the abortion debate hasn’t included a key voice: women who have undergone the procedure themselves.",t2_ekmed3xe,1644577647,prochoice

I Just Can't Get Behind the Pro-Life Movement.,"Yes, I understand abortion kills a fetus. Yeah, I get that it makes the pro-life people sad or angry. I just can't justify forced birth. As a semi-radical animal rights activist and environmentalist, I just can't be pro-life. There's also my belief that bodily autonomy rights are a key component in true freedom but that's secondary. There is absolutely nothing you can do to convince me that nearly 7.7 billion people living a modern lifestyle (and corporate greed) isn't the cause behind the environmental and wild life crisis. I'm in favor of anything that controls the human population and think men and women should be able to get the snip for free and without hassle. You simply can't be an animal rights activist or environmentalist and be against abortion. Even if I wasn't what I list above, I STILL absolutely can't be pro-life. Why? I've been educated on the horrors of pregnancy and child birth. Forcing any law abiding citizen to go through a minimum of 9 months of suffering with a chance to fricking die from said suffering is insane and barbaric! Yes, it's a life. You know what else it is? It's not born! It has no goals, no memories, can't feel pain for two thirds if it's development, it can't think or reason, it is neither aware of nor can it interact with it environment around it for most of its development, it has no survival instincts nor does it have anyone that has emotional ties to it. There is nothing unethical about killing a fetus, and it's a moral grey area at best.


Now that I've stated the ethical reasons as to why I can't  be pro-life, let's move on to the moral reasons why I can't be pro-life. Emotional manipulation is a favorite  tool of theirs. You cannot understand how much I utterly LOATHE this aspect of the pro-life movement. Raise your hand if you've seen or heard ""heartbeat at 6 weeks"" from the pro-life movement. This is a favorite red herring of pro-life movement. A fetus has a heart STEM at 6 weeks. It doesn't an actual heart until 10 weeks. You what my most hated pro-life argument is? ""Don't punish the baby for the crime if the father!"" You all you what that quote is referring to. You know who's  suffering in that situation? The pregnant person. You know who isn't? The fetus. Exactly how are you punishing something that has no concept of pain or suffering, and lacks the ability to process those things? I unsubbed form a YouTuber I used to like when she vomited out this 'argument'. Forcing someone birth a child from r*pe is textbook example of barbaric and draconian! Their most agreaguos form of emotional  manipulation is weaponising children in the name of their cause. It really wouldn't hard for me to find 5 examples of this either. From having a child narrate a pro-life video, to sending their kids to a pro-life boot camp they've mastered the 'art' of using children to manipulate emotions. Last, but definitely not least, crisis pregnancy centers, vans, and RVs. The entire purpose of these is to do whatever it takes without breaking the law to stop you from getting an abortion. Just because they aren't breaking the law doesn't mean they aren't being shady or underhanded. I can easily find 5 examples of this as well.

This sums up why I can't be apart of or identify as pro-life.",t2_2yvv6jxr,1644570555,prochoice

Follow up to What determine morality! the result are in!,"**Fair warning this is a long read! seriously this is a long read scroll down to see just how long it is!**

Hello everyone, this is a follow up to a post I made! If you saw it I ask this subreddit what determine morality, this was me asking you what do you guys think determine morality. The post you are reading right now is gonna be posting in the Pro-life, Abortion debate and Pro- choice subreddit in that order. My reasoning being for doing that is, that is the order in how I posted my original post. I posted it in the Pro-life and abortion debate subreddit before the pro-choice because out of the 3 only the pro-choice have polling! so I figure that I would just ask the 2 sub that don't allow polling and gather all the answers that I could and let the pro-choice people vote! and if they wanted to add a new idea on what determine morality they were free to do so.

Now that I got all the introductory stuff out of the way I wanna share the result of this ""research"" to all the sub Reddit and let you all see what people think determine morality! I hope you all enjoy looking at the information. So I want you to keep in mind, the way I am determining the number isn't as simple as you might think! you see in the pro-choice polling they only allow for 6 options to be put on a poll and 1 of them I had to set aside for a ""show result"" option, and I had 11 options! to write down so what I did was put down the options that I felt was gonna be the most popular or common for the first 4 and for the last one I just group the remaining ones and had an options that said **'One of the the other options that isn't on this list!'.** However at the end of the day, that subreddit is gonna be easy to count because it's a poll unlike the pro-life and abortion debate subreddit where I am gonna have to count manually. With that being said, for better or for worse not many people in the prolife and maybe abortion debate subs really participated in this little research of mine so for better or for worse this make my job easier.

One thing that came to mind as I am typing this post is that, for the sake of being accurate I will count up votes but I will differentiates between the 2. so for example if 3 people put unicorns as their determining factor and 15 people upvotes the first comment, 5 people upvote the second comment and 1000 people upvote the third comment I will put 'Unicorns - 1023 votes -(1020 of them was upvotes)'. my reason being is that is that I honestly fear that their could be a situation where 340 people that have 3 account each log into their 3 account and upvoted those 3 comment so it look like an extra 1020 believe that a mythological creature set the stranded for morality. while that maybe unlikely I still would like to prevent that if I can! also rereading what I wrote I know the math don't add up with the vote becuase not all the comment have equal upvote but my point still stands. so with all of that being said we can finally get into the votes.

So for the options I had all together

1. GOD
2. Law
3. Ethics
4. Empathy (mainly when it comes to suffering)
5. Human Rights
6. Majority/ Society.
7. Majority (but also social and cultural revolutions impact morality.)
8. Morality is subjective so there is no real determine factor
9. Morality is subjective so Abortion should be a legal matter!
10. What is best for our species as a whole !
11. The fundamental rights that have set the foundation for life as we know it!

|Options|Results|\# of Upvotes|**'One of the the other options that isn't on this'**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GOD|44|35||
|Law|0|0||
|Ethics|31|0||
|Empathy including but not limiting to (mainly when it comes to suffering)|14|6|\+14|

End Notes

* Plz do remember as you read this chart that for the first section I combine the number of comments I got wit the upvote. so for god I didn't get 44 different comment saying god! it was like 5 comment that when combine with the upvote the number came to 44! the second column are just the up votes not the comment! The third column is from the pro-choice poll where I just lump all the other options into one, so because I have no way of figuring out who believes in what, I just gave all the other columns +14
* For some reason I forgot/neglected to add certain comments to the list and I can't figure out where exactly I should put their vote so I am putting them here!  

   * Basically there exists some big long list of rights and obligations somewhere in the abstract, everyone has a right to do anything (including something like shooting a person in the face for fun), but bad things which one might do are trumped by someone else's rights or your obligations (i.e. right not to be murdered and obligations not to harm without cause) 1 upvotes
   * Morality concerns how our actions affect other conscious creatures, beings that are capable of suffering. 5 upvote
   * Experience. -2 votes
* At the time of me making this post there was 98 people who voted on my poll in the pro-choice sub reddit and there was 4 days 22 hours left so the number did changed
* Tell me do you think that this was a good way to determine morality?",t2_4peg9a81,1644379641,prochoice

"Prolife aligning as the righteous ""Moral Majority"" isn't because they have a righteous cause - It's because they don't actually have any of their own rights on the line that would force them to have to barter"," (I originally had this as part of my most recent post about our rhetoric and how it needs to change. But I felt like it needed to be it's own post.)

Part of the reason anti-choicers have been so successful is that they throw every kind of argument at the wall and see what sticks. For example, some people are turned off by anti-choice rhetoric because of the anti-woman messaging - so a response to this was the ""love them both"" message to bring in those people.

We need to broaden our arguments out more. They aren't winning because they somehow hold the moral high ground. *They are winning because they haven't had anything to lose.*

The fact of the matter is, they don't stand to lose any of their human rights by playing this game - that is what has made it so easy to use abortion bans in order to manipulate their voter base. Have you ever seen the [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10357009-the-unborn-are-a-convenient-group-of-people-to-advocate) about how the ""unborn are a convenient group to advocate for?"" Since they aren't bartering for gaining or losing their human rights, *they don't actually have to stick within the confines of their morals in the arguments that they make.*

Conversely, people who have reproductive rights on the line potentially compromise their rights if they weaponize the very morals they are trying to protect. This is why, for example, we can't just throw the idea of forced vasectomies into the foray in the fight for bodily autonomy over abortion. Not only are we throwing our morals under the bus, but we could effectively be harming people along the way.

There isn't an anti-choice equivalent to this upon a cursory look - no matter what they do, they will always retain their right to life and their reproductive right to *have* babies. (That anti-choice women lose their right to abortions as well is of little consequence - those people keep themselves subdued by either believing that their abortion would be morally permissible, or they are too afraid to speak out because they will be cast out of their social support.) It allows them to maintain this appearance of being morally superior, not because it actually *is* more moral, but because there are no drawbacks to the scrutiny. Which in turn gives a feedback loop of seeming morally superior.

If they actually had something to lose in this social warfare, we would effectively have something that we could attempt to use to negotiate with them on. If they have rights on the line they then have to start providing compromises in order to *keep* their right. But we are only advocating for us to keep our rights, not take rights away from them. Which makes this whole ""balancing of the rights"" untenable.

And this exposes the corruption within this supposedly morally superior movement - true martyrs, true causes, stand to lose something. The concept of just war, for example, requires that you sacrifice lives for your cause. And they stand against those that are wielding their human rights as bartering tools - who are laying privilege to something they are not entitled to.

It is an extremely privileged position to have your rights honored while you advocate for them being revoked from others. The perfect imagery for this is to imagine clinic protestors who have made this into a full time hobby. What sort of time and money do you have at your disposal, that you can be out there on your soapbox ""saving babies"" while shouting at the people who, through voting, you have placed obstacles in their pathway, such that they struggled just to find the time or money, to be there. These patients have to take time off of work, struggle to find funds, find childcare and transportation, possibly even lodging, just to be there.

The contrast is a great metaphor for the actual social struggle that is going on. Anti-choicers aren't struggling to make ends meet while fighting for their rights. They are privileged people fighting for a privileged cause.

Anti-choice rights are safe - so it makes it seem like they are fighting for a righteous and just cause, that they are doing this out of the goodness of their hearts in order to protect innocent unborn baby's lives. When the fact of the matter is, that without something to *loss,* without a risk to be taken, the idea that your cause is somehow morally superior, is completely meaningless.

So what do they actually gain from their cause that is so important that they fight for? Well we need only look at the fruits of their labor.

* They impose their idea of sexual morality on people which puts them in favor with their god and helps them justify why they've deprived themselves.
* For those who have had abortions and were shamed by their prolife community, it offers a way to cope with that trauma, to atone for their sins, but keeping others from having an abortion.
* They gain new babies and cause financial strife and crisis for their mother's. This will make them perfect targets for evangelizing them to join their church. This is further evidenced by the fact that they refuse to have their tax payer dollars go towards social welfare programs - instead, they advocate that these needs are better served by the church. But this pools the money to small locations and won't reach as many people - so the advocacy is a means to create a community need for the church, which further allows for them to indoctrinate people. (As a former Christian, God commands you to evangelize to people and help them hear the word of the Lord. Any resistance that is met, is a sign of the Devil's presence and the persecution tells them they are where they are supposed to be. It is not a great mentality for 1st Amendment rights and the respecting of freedom of and from religion of others.) It's manufacturing the problem in order to sell the solution.
* Or it could be that these babies will go into the adoption system, which is, you guessed it, typically run by religious organizations. Who then claim religious freedom to be able to discriminate on who they adopt to (affluent, white, straight Christians), and make big money while doing it (adoption of newborn infants isn't cheap.)
* They restore traditional female roles, which puts them back in the home at the mercy of those who can financially provide for them. And it's a great way to subjugate transpeople back into their traditional gender roles as well.
* And let's not forget where this originally started from, politically, in the US - abortion rights served as a proxy for mobilizing evangelical voters to vote into power politicians who wanted to keep ""State's Rights"" - which is a dog whistle for racism. If anyone has seen the documentary The 13th, along with the forming of the anti-abortion moral majority of the Reagan era, the war on drugs was implemented. These laws disproportionately disadvantaged POC. And once in the system, they served longer prison times than white people. This relished black POC back into a legal form of enslavement. Abortion bans will result in laws that will criminalize people for having abortions and WOC will be disproportionately affected. Once in the system, they will serve longer sentences than their white counter parts. This will leave their reproductive years out of jail shorter, and make it harder for them to start families. This is a racist wet dream. And single issue evangelical voters are playing into that reality.

So when we see the true fruits of their labor - advancing religious imposition, atonement, poverty, traditional gender roles, transgender people kept chained to their biology, politicians mobilizing racist causes, money for the church, babies adopted to the ""right"" people - when we go beyond the cursory reading of the cause, a much harsher reality is revealed.",t2_6gi7y,1644116528,prochoice

"Pro-lifers legitimately fucking scare me, and I don't know what to do about it.","So I'm at a point where even seeing pro-lifer stuff sends me into fits of anger and terror. 

I'm terrified of these people. I'm not even in any real danger from them since my tubes are tied and I'm on an IUD. But the idea of the kind of world pro-lifers want and seeing its real world effects fills me with so much dread I can't even think straight. 

When I actually *do* have my head on straight, I would rather there be less abortions and more other options that don't involve it. I have some respect for the idea of a ZEF being a human life even if I don't agree with it. 

But running across them in the wild sets something off in my brain, and suddenly it's all air raid sirens. 

I've started to realize it doesn't even really have to do with babies, children, or ZEFs. It's not even about sex or sex education and birth control. It's not even about pregnancy. 

It's about the fact that I don't want to live in a society where conservative authoritarians can force their beliefs on others. I don't want the power to make laws that will affect everyone's lives in the hands of ideologues who place their religious and cultural agenda over and above the health, safety, and freedom of the people. I don't want people who see my queer, trans, AFAB, childfree existence as an abomination that deserves eternal torture to be able to decide what anyone else is allowed to do with their body.  

I don't want people with such a callous disregard for all other forms of human life and obsession with judgment and punishment of those who don't conform to their view of the world to have any sort of moral authority.

Do you agree with me on this?,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Saying that the mother (or father) force a fetus into her womb and force it into dependency is wrong because the whole fertilization and impregnation process is well a Process! that is something neither parent's can control and the fetus is the one that need to make a journey to the uterus. saying that a women should be force to remain pregnant and give birth because she force the fetus into her, then going by that logic since around 30-50% of zef don't implant into the uterus then those women should be charged with child neglect since she did something to neglect her health which is why the zef didn't implant or murder/manslaughter since if we are going with the logic that the mother force the fetus into her womb then I wanna make the argument that any women who don't have the zef implant into her uterus force the zef into a situation where it would died and there for should be arrested for killing of the zef.  

   1. Also going with this logic, any time a ectopic pregnancy happens, then the women should not have any type of priory when it come to medical health or she should be place in a ward to prevent her from hurting herself
2. **'It's the women fault for having sex, this is a consequence for her action'** In my opinion this is mostly false! so for one you are blaming the women and making her take sole responsibility for something that 2 people cause, however I will ignore the obvious sexism here and state my point. My point is that the blame belong to the person who force the sperm into the women vagina and started the whole process (which in most cases would be the men). since in order fertilization to even begin the sperm and egg cells need to meet and combine! sex is just a method for that to happened it's not the cause of pregnancy. I can say this for 2 reason 1. if sex was the cause of pregnancy aka you have sex you become pregnant then I think the concept of oral and anal sex along with condoms would like to say something! 2. unless I don't know how sperm bank work and they just have the male workers/sperm doners just go down on the women in question and I just been ignorant on that, then I am sure anyone who work at a sperm back or had gotten pregnant via sperm bank would also agree with me on this!

A long time ago I was pro-life.,"A long time ago I was pro-life. I was raised in a family that believed ""the baby has a right to live."" I felt this way for a very long time. 

Until I was 17 and had an unplanned pregnancy. I wasn't interested in getting an abortion (I don't think I would change that, but I support anybody's right to do it!). I decided I wanted to put the baby up for adoption. My mother totally disagreed with me and said I would regret it forever. I decided to keep the baby. 

My pregnancy went, just typically morning sickness and weight gain, expanding belly, stretch marks the usual, didn't really bother me this time around (later pregnancy it really irritated me).  I couldn't pee right; apparently that's normal. 

My whole body started to swell really bad around 28 weeks. My obgyn (obviously not very good) dismissed it as nothing. 

My pregnancy went on. I started to suffer from severe side pain, blurred vision, and bad headaches. My obgyn dismissed it all. 

At my 37 week checkup, I was so swollen I couldn't move. My obgyn once again dismissed it until my mother noticed something wrong. My blood pressure was 220/140. The obgyn said it's just a little high, no worries. My mom freaked out. Another doctor came in and took my urine. I had high proteins. I had severe pre eclampsia. 

I went straight in for induction. It was very painful and took a long time. I got a really high fever and became very sick. My blood pressure went higher. They wanted to do an emergency c section but then decided to wait a little bit longer. I delivered the baby vaginally and suffered severe tearing that had to be stitched. 

To this day, I still get scar tissue pain. 

I had a second unplanned pregnancy. I decided to keep the baby. The same thing happened again except I had a better obgyn. I had a planned c section at 36 weeks because of severe pre eclampsia again. 

I still have scar tissue pain on my stomach also. 

I still have extremely high blood pressure because my pre eclampsia never resolved itself. I was in the hospital for a week after both births. I will most likely have permanently high blood pressure that I am seeing specialists for because my medication can't control. 

I am 30 pounds heavier and have stretch marks, saggy skin, diastis recti, and saggy breasts

Sex Strike if Roe v Wade is overturned,"I wonder if women refusing to have sex with men if abortions are banned would be the pushback needed to get better abortion laws in place. 

For context I (F 25) have an IUD and have been in a great relationship for nearly 4 years now. He and I are on the same page about not having children so that has never been much of a concern. I have tried to have my tubes tied, however I run into the problem that most young women do when trying to get sterilized, ""Are you married? What if your future husband wants kids?"". My partner has said he is going to get a vasectomy, but is dragging his feet on it, as men tend to do when it comes to pain in their sensitive bits. 

Because I have an IUD, I am at a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. These pregnancies are not viable (there's no way to move the fetus from the tube into the uterus to make it viable) and these pregnancies can kill the mother. There have been instances where a woman died from an ectopic pregnancy thaf did not have access to abortion procedures to remove this non viable pregnancy.  If I don't have access to an abortion even in this extreme circumstance, I am not having sex. I am not going through a hellish death for some sex. Even with a wonderful boyfriend. It's just not happening. I know that risk is super small, but I'm not taking that risk. 

If Roe v Wade is overturned and abortions are banned, I think women should stop having sex with men. Boyfriends, husband's, flings, none of them. I think if we managed to get the other half of the population upset we might have a chance at having our rights protected.

What determine morality?,"I already ask this on the r/prolife and r/Abortiondebate sub reedit! I save this subreddit for last because it's the only one out of the three with polling, so I just gather all the answer I could and let you guys vote. Feel free to put your own answer in the comments.

I came here to talk about morality but as the title suggest I wanna ask you guys what you think determine morality!?

To make it simple on mainly myself but everyone involved, I will go into this assuming that morality is objective! So for me personally I believe that morality is 100% subjective since morality is what you as a person find acceptable and unacceptable. abortion is good example of this because even when it come to people that agree that abortion should either mostly be banned or mostly be legal, there are disagreement on when the cut of point or the exceptions should be for abortion. always allow abortion to be legal, stop abortion after viability, allow exception for rape, incest, children and the mother life, only allow exception for the mother life, never allow exception. Now while I believe that morality is subjective, I do believe that their are standards that we base and shape our morality around. In simpler term I believe that good/bad and right/wrong are 2 different things!

I can see how this get too confusing and too philosophical so for the sake of this question we will go with the idea that they are the same! good and bad and right and wrong. Now I wanna ask you, what do you think determine what is good or right and what is wrong or bad? If you was to ask me I personally would say the majority is what determine good/right and bad/wrong. People have try to argue with me on this by asking me about slavery and my answer is always the same, slavery was seen as a good thing by the majority during the time period that it was allow! so during their time period slavery would at the very least been morally acceptable but if we go by this time period then no slavery is not morally good or acceptable. There are people who believe morality is determine by law, and I had someone try to argue against me that morality is what is right and wrong which doesn't help in determining if anything is morally good/right or right/wrong.

so I wanna hear from you, what do you think determine morality?

Here is the list I gather!

1. GOD
2. Law
3. Ethics
4. Empathy (mainly when it comes to suffering)
5. Human Rights
6. Majority/ Society.
7. Majority (but also social and cultural revolutions impact morality.)
8. Morality is subjective so there is no real determine factor 
9. Morality is subjective so Abortion should be a legal matter!
10. What is best for our species as a whole !
11. The fundamental rights that have set the foundation for life as we know it!

A modest proposal,"I propose a way to drastically reduce the incidents of abortion in the USA. 


But first, let me say that I support a woman's right to get an abortion up to the point right before brain activity is detected in the fetus. A brain-dead adult with a heart beat is removed from life support. In other words, they are aborted. Why should the standards for a fetus be different?


(Of course I support abortion if the life of the mother is at risk.)


About 60% of boys in the USA get circumcised shortly after birth. Are they given a choice for bodily autonomy?  Of course not. So if most men are not given the choice to keep their complete, whole body intact, then the people who believe this mutilation is OK should have no objection to also giving these babies a vasectomy.


If most men are unable to impregnate a woman until they are able to get reversal surgery, the incidents of unwanted pregnancy would drastically decline.


It's time for the religious zealots to quit persecuting women and instead focus on the source.

Pro life or pro choice,"I posted this on both the pro choice and pro life subreddit.

I hope both sides are open to a civil discussion.

I want to hear the arguments of both sides since I am sort of in the middle.
I know it's a very controversial topic with a lot of emotions, so i want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hurt or offend anyone!

My opinion is kinda in the middle right now, I'm pretty sure both sides hate me for my opinion.


Basically, in pro choice, but I agree that an abortion is immoral.


Pretty much every time I hear people discussing this topic, it comes down to if you see a fetus as a baby or a fetus.

But that is not relevant at all, it's just a name that is emotionally loaded.

I myself do see a fetus as a living being, but it's not the same as a living human.


I believe that ending the (potential) life of a fetus is immoral, I don't believe it's murder, but it's still taking the choice away form a potential human.
Often i hear like: it's what is best for the baby, or potential human, from pro choice advocates.

But sorry, that argument is BS.
You can't predict what kinda life the potential baby is gonna live. 
Lots of people grow up in poverty and still have a happy life.
That you think you aren't able to provide a good childhood for the potential baby, doesn't mean it won't have a good childhood. 
It's something you can't know, maybe he will suffer in foster care, maybe he/she will become the next president even though he/she grew up in Forster care.
You can't know, so your argument that you are doing it for the (potential) baby is invalid.

But i totally understand people who would get a abortion.
It's not fair that you have to trough your whole live away just cause you made one mistake.
Being pregnant sucks and if you were to give birth to a child, giving him/her away would be an awful experience.

So I am pro choice. I don't think a woman has to trough away her life for a potential baby.

But it's still a immoral choice, you make that choice not for the potential baby, but for yourself, and it's unfair to pretend otherwise.

But it's totally okay to make a selfish choice.
Everyone makes mistakes, and it's unfair if you have to give up everything just cause of one mistake you made i your life.


So, abortus isn't murder, because a fetus and a human aren't the same.
You can't tell me that if you had to chose to save the live of a fetus or a human child, you would save the life of the fetus..

But in the other hand, you are still preventing the life of a potential human, because you value your life and health above that of the fetus.
So I would say that is still immoral.
I'm not saying it is bad or wrong.

Because humans are selfish and immoral by design, it's okay to make a selfish it immoral decision.

Besides baning abortion won't stop abortion, it will only make it more dangerous.


I know this is a opinion that people on both sides of the spectrum would hate me for.

But i think that the happiness of the nother ways more as the potential life of the fetus.",t2_27ufe9oy,1643329182,prochoice

What is your objection/counter argument to the “responsibility” argument from the pro-life side?,"A very, very common argument from pro-lifers is that people need to take responsibility for their actions. There’s many ways you can go about refuting this, so I’d like to hear some ideas from other people. 

Here are some common lines of reasoning behind the responsibility argument:  

- Because the woman had sex with consent, knowing the risk of pregnancy, and then took the risk, woman has an obligation to carry to term. Even though it requires her body, that is negated by how she is partly to blame for why the ZEF needs her uterus. 

-  We have a moral obligation to the children we create, therefore, we also have a obligation to allow them to be born. 

- Abortion is basically running away from the responsibility of caring for someone you created. And that’s why getting an abortion isn’t responsible. 

- If there are any others feel free to bring it up.

I’m pro choice but some of the pro choice arguments are just bad,"If you ask me, a woman should be able to get an abortion specifically because her happiness/life/freedom is in danger. It’s like self defense. If someone breaks into your house you’re allowed to kill them in fear of them stealing your shit, damaging your property, hurting you.

If you don’t want a kid eating your food, making you gain weight, and tearing you up on the way out I think abortion is fair game.

That’s my opinion.

What I don’t get is “my body my choice”. Because it’s just not your body. Yes it has implications that effect your body, but the way it’s phrased makes it seem like you can do whatever you want to the baby. 

Like would you argue “my body my choice” if someone wanted to reach in, cut off the arms and legs of the fetus, and proceed with the pregnancy as normal just forcing the baby to have no arms or legs when they’re born

Obviously I think no one on here supports forcing babies to be born without limbs because you all are good people, but it goes to show that you don’t think my body my choice. You probably think closer to me where it’s a separate body, but your happiness and your life comes first, and you may need to have the baby removed if you aren’t in a state where you want to have one.",t2_dhtuih0w,1643296319,prochoice

Question about the legal side of things,"Hi! I’m am currently a UK student with an interest in US politics and I am Pro-Choice.

I am currently writing a piece on whether abortion laws should be decided by the state government for a module im studying at university.

To me, it is obvious that any government should not have the right to exercise any involvement in a decision that belongs to a woman and their doctor, over their body. I have all the information on the history since Roe v Wade and more. 

What I am struggling with however is how does this come into practice, legally? If the states do not get to practice any forms of power - does the power get relocated elsewhere such as it has been (with the Supreme Court through Roe vs Wade?) does this not mean if the states no longer have power over such laws, when presidents such as Trump, Bush &amp; Reagan do what they have done and fill the courts with pro-life conservative figures the power is so concentrated in one area, that it is largely possible that it could swing too far the other way? Leaving no room for any form of legalisation. How is it possible to remove the topic of abortion completely out of the hands of the government, or is it not? 

Sorry to sound naive, I hope nobody takes this the wrong way - just trying to understand how it could work. 

Thanks :)",t2_3rjaprg5,1643200663,prochoice

The only pro-life argument that’s ever stumped me.,"When arguing with pro-lifers, I tend to use the bodily autonomy argument, that is, the idea that a person cannot use another person’s body against their will. It usually goes well for me. Pro lifers have a lot of responses to this argument, and usually they’re easily refuted. However, one response actually had me stumped. 

The person brought up a situation with conjoined twins, where one twin was using the other’s kidneys because their own weren’t functioning or something along those lines. In this case, person A would not be permitted to use lethal force against person B even to preserve their own bodily autonomy. 

I struggle to offer a rebuttal to this point without sliding into the personhood debate. I said something about how the concept of bodily autonomy can’t apply to conjoined twins because their bodies have never existed independently of one another. I would also argue that doing gestational work is different from simply allowing a person to exist who just happens to be using your organs. 

I was wondering if any of you have any thoughts.",t2_54jhgk0r,1643154696,prochoice

"""A Fetus/Zygote is a Child"" - This is the CORE Argument","All the ""pro-choice"" arguments fail unless you address this basic concept. As long as there are some people who believe that a zygote or a fetus is a human being, other arguments are useless.

**Example:**

Pro Choice argument: My body, my rights.  
Comeback: The right of a child to not be murdered for no fault of theirs is greater than your bodily right.

Pro Choice argument: The government doesn't get to decide what I do with my body.  
Comeback: The government's job is to prevent murder. You can't murder someone even if that person is causing you inconvenience.

Pro Choice argument: People will have abortions one way or the other  
Comeback: Just because murders will keep happening, doesn't mean we get rid of murder laws

Pro Choice argument: Most people don't believe early abortion is wrong  
Comeback: Murder is wrong regardless of what anyone thinks. It's the government job to protect life.

So stop beating around the bush. All pro-abortion arguments have to address this basic idea - How do you deal with people who believe that a fetus is a child, and that abortion is murder?

Here are some ideas:

1. Ask them why there's no outrage over IVF procedures that kill dozens of fertilized eggs. If those eggs were really children, then there should be mass outrage from everyone. Yet the pro-life argument is massively silent on this issue.

2. If you could save one 5-year old, or save 100 fertilized eggs, which would they choose? If a zygote is a child, then the answer should always be the fertilized eggs. Yet no one says this.

My personal opinion is a bit extreme for most, but here it is:

1. There's no standard definition of ""life"". Different science books have different definitions, so it's important to understand that this is not an objective reality, but a subjective one.

2. ""Life"" is unimportant. I had chicken last night, was its life so valuable? So spare me the ""life is valuable"" BS. We kill all the time, every day and every night. I don't care about ""life"".

3. The value of a ""life"" depends on its conscious experience. Pain. Suffering. Awareness. By these metrics, a zygote or a fetus is worthless. A sleeping person has latent value in the memories and mind that they've built up through the years, and that's why we don't kill people who sleep.

4. A baby's value increases as it grows older. Going from pretty worthless, to more and more valuable as its capacity for suffering grows.

But like I said, these are my personal views. For ordinary arguments, I suggest going with the IVF example.",t2_35dpb,1643136265,prochoice

What I think of “Abortion is murder”,"When anti-choicers call abortion murder, they’re not saying that it’s illegal. They’re using it as a form of moral condemnation. Let’s define murder, when it comes to the moral condemnation, as “premeditated immoral or unjustified killing, especially of an innocent person.”

I see that anti-choicers believe that abortion is murder commonly because of this reason: 

- The fetus did not choose to be here. It had no choice to be placed into the womb. Therefore, the ZEF is innocent and absolved of blame. And to kill it, would be a killing an innocent, therefore it is murder. Abortion is unjustified and should be illegal because it kills an innocent human being.

Although I believe that a ZEF cannot be innocent, that’s not the point of my post. Now assume this to be true: the ZEF is innocent and abortion is unjustified.

The majority of anti-choicers also believe that the only exception to abortion should be if the pregnancy poses a threat to the woman’s life. This is where I believe the line of thinking is flawed. Abortions done for life-threats still kills an innocent baby. Would that not still be murder since the life of someone innocent is deliberately taken? 

You  could argue that it’s not the same because women who terminate healthy pregnancies are not in the same situation as women who are experiencing great harm from their pregnancies. This doesn’t change anything. In other words, in spite of circumstance, this rebuttal doesn’t change the innocence of the ZEF. Regardless of what reason you seek an abortion, the ZEF doesn’t intentionally harm you. Thus, they’re innocent no matter what. 

So with this in mind, if you don’t think abortion for life-threats is murder, then 
- The “abortion is murder because an innocent human being is killed” logic is inconsistent. You would have to renounce the claim that the ZEF is innocent.

If you think abortion for life-threats *is* still murder, then: 
- It would only make sense for you to ban abortion completely with no exceptions since killing an innocent baby is always wrong.

In the end he inherited himself a country full of unwanted children many of them going through a brutal foster care system which in turn made these children into brutal adults. At the end, the communist state of Romania was toppled after all these poor brutalized now adults overthrew the government by arresting their leader and his wife, immediately putting them on trial and within an hour and a half of his sentence they were executed.

Of course I'm referring to the US because our expenses are so high but in other countries, this could be replaced with a child allowance. I think some countries already do this at least for poor people.

My point is, why don't American pro lifers just create an organization that will give money to people for their medical expenses and recovery. If they are worried about people taking advantage of their system, then they can just simply provide it for only people who will give their kid up for adoption. Yeah, that part sucks but it does take care of the whole thing in regards to them saying that people should just give their kid up for adoption.

Do you think a woman should have the choice to abort if the reason for abortion is the gender of the foetus?,"I was in a debate with fellow pro-choicers about this issue (https://www.reddit.com/r/Kerala/comments/s7595f/people_of_keralawhats_your_opinion_on_abortions/ht7u0td/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)

Basically, in India, the gender of the foetus is not revealed as aborting female foetuses is quite common, thereby messing up the sex ratio. I believe that women should have the right to abort if the gender is not to their preference, because choice is choice. The decision to terminate falls on one person only, the mother. No matter what the reason, women should get to choose.

But apparently a lot of PCers don’t believe that, because they don’t want the consequences of a skewed sex ratio. I 100% agree that the consequences will be dire. But a pregnant woman is not under the obligation to serve the society. She only needs to do what’s best for her.

Murphy Signs Bill Enshrining Abortion Into NJ State Law,"""TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, anticipating possible changes to the Roe v. Wade ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, signed a bill Thursday enshrining the right to an abortion into state law.

Murphy signed the measure in the waning days of his first term, fulfilling a campaign pledge made in the lead-up to his reelection victory in November and after it appeared as if the Democrat-led Legislature might fail to advance the bill.

""Regardless of whether or not the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, New Jersey's position in support of the right to reproductive autonomy will remain clear and unchanged,"" Murphy said during a signing ceremony in Teaneck, New Jersey.

The final version of the bill leaves out a requirement for insurance coverage of abortion that some advocates had sought and instead authorizes the state Banking and Insurance Department to study the issue and possibly adopt regulations if a need is discovered.

In addition to abortion rights, the bill also specifically outlines a right to access contraception, as well as to carry a pregnancy to term.

New Jersey joins 14 states and the District of Columbia with statutory protections for abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank.

A Supreme Court ruling could come in June in a case in which the court was asked to overturn a nationwide right to abortion that has existed for five decades.

The case has state legislatures across the country responding to the possibility of seismic changes to the 1973 Roe ruling. Republican-led legislatures are ready to further restrict or ban abortions outright, and Democratic-controlled ones seek to ensure access to abortion.

At least 20 states, mostly across the South and Midwest, already have laws that would restrict or ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe and lets states decide the issue, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

In New Jersey, Murphy had pushed for the bill, but it was stalled in the Democrat-led Legislature as the majority faced voters in November and then reeled from losing six Assembly seats and a net loss of one in the Senate.""

Thought on why prolife women insist their fetus is a baby &amp; so highly revere pregnancy: it defines them as worthwhile human beings,"Think about it - if their fetus wasn't a full person, a baby, from the moment of conception, then pregnancy isn't as noble and beautiful.

Motherhood is revered especially by these people. If they aren't carrying a baby, maybe they feel they aren't really all that special yet. People love babies. And people see pregnant people differently because they view them as having a baby inside them - the most precious, innocent being to be fiercely protected and hyper focused on. All that matters in life. And all of that translates to how they treat the mother. She's truly special to have the highest honor of carrying a baby inside her.

I recall how excited my friend was to be pregnant. She said everyone doted on her when she was pregnant but when the baby was born, no one cared about her as much and they focused more on the baby. I feel like this is a lot of women's experiences. Pregnancy is a high for them. And that's why they also can't see how pregnancy could be viewed as a bad thing.

And they are coming from the background of being taught that this is what their worth is wrapped up in. They go through the steps of bonding with their husband and are taught that ""one day, when you grow up, you will get married to a wonderful man and have children of your own."" This is the goal of life that is ingrained in them. There isn't much more beyond marriage and children that gets talked about on a societal level. They are finally at the stage where they are their most valued in their mind - this is what they've been told their entire life with things like purity culture and abstinence only sex ed. 

*If they have to go through the hardships and sacrifice of pregnancy, it means more to them if they are doing it for an already real, full baby*, not just going through some biological process. And since they know they are closing in on having an actual baby, their excitement ""births"" their motherhood. They are making decisions for their coming baby and have already shifted their mind to accept motherhood. We do this with lots of things - going through college to gain your degree is one aspect where someone might do that.

So what do you think?",t2_6gi7y,1642429497,prochoice

If they want to prevent unwanted pregnancies, there are numerous things they can do to support that desire - access to birth control, providing sex education, and alleviating poverty first among them.

If you don't want the child take contraceptives and/or give it up for adoption because there are a lot of wonderful families that would love that baby. On the topic of adoption, I am living in Eastern Europe so I don't know exactly how the foster system works for you guys, but I know there are problems. That's why taking contraceptives is very important. And if the baby is the product of rape, incest etc. then do your thing. I repeat, I don't condemn anyone who had an abortion, but it isn't something that I agree with.

Looking for feedback on my argument for choice,"One of the most common pro-life arguments is that a fetus is a living being, an unborn child, and that killing it should be seen as equivalent to murder.

It is frequently used to emotionally browbeat those who argue for choice; being called a murderer, satanist, or eugenicist will quickly shut down many people who do not have a logical reply.

It does not matter when life begins. It does not matter whether a fetus is a human being, and it does not matter whether it is alive or not.

That entire argument is unimportant; a distraction, a totally useless, subjective, and unwinnable circular argument that could not hope to matter less to either side.

The stage of life is similarly unimportant. It does not matter whether the life in question is of a fetus, a five year old, or a Nobel Prize winning physicist.

NOBODY has the right to use your body, against your will, to save their life or the life of anybody else. 

That’s it.

That is the only important argument.

You cannot be forced to donate your blood, or your bone marrow, or your vital organs, despite tens of thousands of people dying every year on waiting lists.

Nobody can harvest your organs, not even after your death, without your explicit, written, pre-mortem permission. This is because your body is legally your own, whether its composite parts can be used to help others or not.

Why should it be any different if a woman is impregnated?

To deny women the right to abortion is to treat them with less bodily autonomy than a corpse.

She has not changed as a person, she does not cease to be human, her rights should not spontaneously disappear.


There is only one position that could conceivably be used to support the dehumanization of a woman in the name of the fetus she is carrying. One would necessarily need to believe that the supreme purpose of women is to get pregnant, incubate fertilized embryos, and birth new children. 



In order to have moral consistency with this belief, one would also need to believe that this purpose be prioritized above all other pursuits, and that women should be getting pregnant as early as is physically possible.

One would need to believe that women’s bodies are more vital to reproduction than they are to the existence of the woman to whom they belong.

These viewpoints are clearly both ridiculous and outdated; and no rational, equality-minded person would support them.


One would not support the disallowance of women from voting, public office, education, work, or equal rights in every conceivable way with the other sex.

One would not support the confiscation of human rights from women, unless one should believe that they are anything less than human.

Unless one should believe that women are not human, then one must believe that they are entitled to all human rights.

If they are entitled to all human rights, then bodily autonomy is and must be one of them.



Edit: The typical Biblical answer that pro-lifers give is usually along the ""earthen vessels"" argument. That is, that women ARE just here to have children. 

This can be answered with: ""Then why shouldn't they be getting pregnant at 9 and 10 years old?""

If the pro lifer responds that they should, then they are a pedophile or a pedophilia apologist, and nothing else they say need be taken seriously. 

If they say that women shouldn't be getting pregnant at those ages, they will have to admit that such a proposition is morally wrong. 

Regardless of why they believe it is morally wrong, one part of that must be that it is in **some violation of that person's rights, God-given or otherwise.**

They are forced to either conclude that equality is necessary, or admit that they are a supporter of pedophilia.",t2_26dq5e7w,1642260374,prochoice

Tired,"I am exhausted.

Why can’t some people understand what consent is?
I consent to one action. I acknowledge the risk that may come with said action. Consent to one action is not consent to another. Consent is voluntary, specific and can be revoked at any time. 

Bodily autonomy. I am an autonomous being. A fetus that is inside of me, that is literally attached inside of me, is not autonomous. Therefore I have bodily autonomy and the fetus does not. I have the right to remove anything violating my bodily autonomy. 

Pregnant people are not waltzing into a clinic during their 30th week of their pregnancy because they want an abortion. 
Pregnant people who choose to abort during late second trimester or third trimester are making the heart-wrenching decision to attempt to save the life of the pregnant person by aborting a fetus causing distress or by showing mercy on a fetus that is in pain, and in suffering. 

Pregnant people deserve bodily autonomy.

Maybe pro-life people should be focusing on children who are born who are being killed by their parents because they are inconvenient.,"Yeah, it turns out that it's not unusual for autistic kids to be killed by their parents or caretakers.

https://youtu.be/OETvkJpwVlY

When this happens, often times the comments and the dialogue around the incident is sympathy towards the mother saying that she must have reached some kind of breaking point. There's usually no sympathy for the child.

In just that video alone the mother actually walked free. Yeah apparently she didn't go to jail for murdering her kid because the courts had sympathy on her because she reached a breaking point in her mental health?

https://youtu.be/C7NTfZzS9b8

Or check this video out. Content warning, dialogue is kind of disturbing.

Basically in the video the mother talks about how she contemplated killing her autistic daughter by doing a murder suicide by driving off a cliff but but says that the only reason she doesn't is because she has a non-autistic daughter. Oh thank God. You have one normal kid to live for. Wouldn't want you to do a random murder suicide because you can't take care of your autistic daughter. 🙄

Following on from my previous post - my husband and my oldest daughter ""Kara"" drove my pregnant 20 year daughter ""Lily"" back to college while I was at work yesterday, and they just informed me Lily had a surgical abortion today and it went ""safely"" and she is now recovering. My precious first grandbaby was murdered

My youngest two daughters (I have 4, and a son aged 12) found me sobbing. ""Andi"" who is 16 said ""it was the best thing for Lily"", whole ""Emma"" who is 14 said ""I don't think I could have an abortion personally, but it was Lily's body and her choice mom, you need to get over it"". I haven't spoken to my son about it. I am so devastated that I basically have 4 daughters convinced by the world that it is OK to have consensual sex and then murder the children they create just so they can stay at a certain college or because they don't want to ""get fat and covered in stretch marks and never"" as Lily so horribly put it. i'm horrified how selfish my daughter has become, choosing baby murder over the temporary inconvenience of pregnancy, choosing an Ivy league school and killing her baby over finishing college in Arizona and giving life to the child she made through consensual sex. I'm heartbroken.

I asked him by that logic, why I couldn't kill that person because after all, by his standard....they aren't really people? He then said it was because ""they are only missing x amount of chromosomes which isn't that much."" I then stated that that didn't matter by that logic because by his definition earlier because they still weren't human by his standard and thus, should be offered up and slaughtered because of their lack of chromosomes. I also stated that we should also give other apes human rights because they are ""close"" too. (I'm not ableist I'm just using his logic) he then stated after a while that I was ""dehumanizing people and that he doesn't do that so that's the difference between me and him.""

I want to make a person a hate sink in a story without shitting on being pro-choice. How do I improve this?,"[This is what a Hate Sink is, for those unaware.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink) Also, I apologize for how rambling this can feel, I don't quite know how to structure this.

In this story, I want to make sure this person is absolutely hated for the right reason. The story is a murder mystery where a financial firm in Ireland has a conference in my story's main setting, North Candel, Georgia, to discuss upcoming matters. While there, one member of the firm falls over dead. Now, what does this have to do with being pro-choice, you ask?

Well, that comes down to a central character of the series and one of the people from the firm. The central character is Eileen, a woman who has become a main actress on a loved children's tv show. The person from the firm is Eileen's birth mother Penny. Now, this will require a bit of backstory.

In the mid 80's to mid 90's, Penny was a young woman in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She had a one night stand with a man, called Henry for now. She got pregnant as a result and couldn't abort, so Henry stepped up to help her raise the child, who would become Eileen. The two don't marry as Henry wants their finances to be settled before they do. Henry takes a job as a bank teller while Penny becomes a stay-at-home mom. She never wanted to be a parent, as she wanted to travel the world, do exciting things like skydive and the like, but feels that now she can't because she has to raise Eileen.

Things change for Penny when Eileen turns about two years old, as this is she meets Zac Finnegan, son of the person who owns the financial firm mentioned above. He is loaded and into the same kind of stuff she is, and that attracts Penny. She goes on to have an affair with Zac for a couple of years until they decide to run away. When Eileen turns five, Penny drops her off at school one day, packs up her own stuff, and runs off with Zac leaving Eileen and Henry behind.

Years later, Penny and Zac come to visit Eileen on the set of her show in hopes to connect, with Penny even encouraging Eileen to invest in something the firm has cooking. However, it is revealed that in reality, Penny and Zac have been living an incredibly hedonistic lifestyle and were about to be cut off from Zac's father unless they learn to live on a budget. The ""investment"" they wanted Eileen to get in on is actually a way for them to fulfill that budget long enough to satisfy Zac's father. Once they had that done, they planned on dropping out of Eileen's life once again.

Now, I feel I should share further details about Penny to make clear the kind of character I have in mind:

* Penny never sent one cent to Henry after leaving. Her logic was that Henry was the one bringing in money since she didn't have a paying job, so sending money to Henry would just be a waste.

* Penny tells Eileen that if it wasn't for her leaving, Eileen would have never gotten the role on the show or met her loving husband Bennett. 

* Sometime after Penny left, Henry and Eileen immigrated to the US. Henry ended up giving Eileen to the foster system out of a mix of heartbreak and necessity, and Eileen spent most of her childhood being bounced around foster homes in the state of Georgia like a pinball.

* My detective character, Jonas, reveals that Zac and Penny have slept with several other people behind the other's backs through the years. Both Penny and Zac are outraged the other had the nerve to cheat on them.

* Penny apologizes in the sense that she should have realized Eileen was too young to really understand that she kept Penny from her dreams.

* Penny makes a move on Bennett to try and get him to convince Eileen more about the investment,

* Penny and Zac were being cut off because they were partying in Hawaii at the time Zac's mother was being buried for her funeral.

How does this stack up? I also want to have someone else who left her daughter with the birth father, but is a much better person. Suggestions to that would be appreciated.

Safety around Pro-lifers,"Just wanted to make this post to help anyone who sees it and fellow pro-choicers.

If you are going to post about pregnancy, anything private or abortion some safety tips;

1. Use a alt throwaway account because pro-lifers will likely stalk, message and harass you. Even if you only make one post about abortion or unwqnted pregnancy.

2. This may not seem like a big deal but it is because they may follow you around and stalk you for a long time, possibly forever. (I have pro-lifers still stalking me from like 9 months ago, maybe longer).

3. It is especially important if you are in debate sections. They will go to your profile and stalk you across different subs and harass you about your pregnancy, sex life, interests, anything really. They don't respect you and they don't have boundaries.

4. If you know a pro-lifer in real life, it is a very bad and unsafe to tell them if you have an unwanted pregnancy. They may end up harassing you and trying to block you from having an abortion. Especially if they are a family member or partner.

5. If you have an unwanted pregnancy don't go to a crisis pregnancy center or any religious center that focuses on pregnancy. It might seem like a good idea at first but there have been so many cases of pro-lifers getting private information stalking the women before or after their abortion.

6. Do not believe anything pro-lifers say about ""health risks of abortion"" or about ""emotional risks"" or really any ""risk"" the prolifers claim. Only trust your doctor. I have had pro-lifers pm me and try to lie to me before and say abortion causes infertility and health risks.

7. If you post about an unwanted pregnancy or abortion, lock your messages so only approved people can message you. This will prevent threats and harassment

Hope this helps!",t2_5vlvig8t,1641804578,prochoice
Being pro-life is easy when you aren't losing anything...,"There are many political debates that can be divided into two major parties: Those who are actually affected by the issue, and those opposing it who are often unaffected. Examples being LGBT vs Anti-LGBT who are often heterosexual. BLM vs anti-BLM who are often white Americans. Or those in favor of raising taxes on the rich versus those who are against it, who are often at least upper middle-class. And then of course we have pro-life vs pro-choice. 

Pro-lifers are often assumed to be right wing, religious (often Christian), and conservative. This is no coincidence- conservative Christians are taught to have as many children as they can, as early as they can. Many pro-lifers just happen to want big families while young. I've scarcely heard of a pro-lifer who didn't want children (or at least were extremely lax about it. Point is, they wouldn't *mind* having a baby at any time.) These people are exactly the type of people who say things like ""you'll never feel fully ready to have a baby, so you might as well just have one now"" or ""things will work out in the end."" These same people also happen to have a reasonable income.

If these people fell pregnant, they would be completely fine with it. Because it was their plan in the first place. They don't mind having a baby. To them, getting pregnant truly is a slight inconvenience if anything, but not truly unwanted. It's the easiest thing in the world to assume everyone else has your perspective. ""Sure, I don't want an unexpected, unplanned baby, but I'd make it work. What's one more?"" This includes pro-lifers who have been assaulted and got pregnant. Having the baby was *their wish*, what they wanted to do with their own body. The concept of someone forcing her to get an abortion for a baby they chose to have would be an unthinkable loss of her bodily autonomy, and her right to choose. But of course, they don't think about that. 

Pro-lifers will never truly know how it feels to lose their right to bodily autonomy, because to them, the right to choose (to have a baby) was always guaranteed.",t2_d21m08a8,1641798727,prochoice

P6. Since sex creates offspring (The same way gambling makes you lose money) the parents hold liability for his and her child
P7. Pregnancy is forced dependency
P8. A fetus is not a parasite, by definition. Reproduction &amp; Creating offspring is the evolutionary objective meaning of life (see Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species)(I don’t believe a fetus is a parasite, so I don’t see a need for rebutting this argument. 
P9. Personhood is irrelevant as long as the being is human. Random subjective opinions on what makes a human a 'person' are irrelevant as they are subjective and hold no bearing on external reality. Human = Person
P10. There is a difference between killing, letting die, and an organism dying naturally.
P11. Referring to [P4.], the 'kidnapper' has put a child inside her [P6.] [P5.], and forced it to be dependent on her, so she doesn't reserve the right to kill it [P3.] as the child is not a parasite [P8.].",t2_9erqipxs,1641771152,prochoice

Do you think a father have a moral obligation to be in their child life?,"I was discussing this over in the pro-life subreddit a few days ago and everyone who responded believe that a father should be in their child life and ""take responsibility"" regardless if he want to be in their child life or not. 

they kept saying thing like how like every child deserve parents and the father and have a moral obligation to be in their child life.

this was the post in question: [https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/rx4ndj/why\_is\_the\_father\_leaving\_their\_child\_such\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/rx4ndj/why_is_the_father_leaving_their_child_such_a/)

if you don't wanna read this post or the comment the TLDR of these post was: in response to another I saw a lot of pro-lifer hating on this one guy that told is girlfriend of 5 years that if she got pregnant and didn't want an abortion, he would leave her respecting her wishes and not forcing an abortion. people was calling him a deadbeat and stuff like that and I was baffle because this is the same party that not only encourage abodening over abortion is adoption but the feminist of the pro-life party encourage women by telling them that they are strong enough be a single mothers.

so here is a men that is telling his gf that if she got pregnant and didn't want an abortion he would respect her wishes and not force one onto her but he would also leave and the pro-life side believe that people like him should be force to be a parent regardless if they want to or not. I know I specifically talking about the father but this also could count for the mother since I remember a post that was posted here like last week about a guy on tik tok that stop is baby mother from having an abortion and she left him with the child and apparently the comment section was upset with the mother. so this can go both ways!

If you read the comment section of my other post then you will know that I personally don't believe that the parent's are morally obligated to take care of their children that they create and birth. Take care in the sense of being in the child life, I just wanted to make that clear

1. I never heard that a parent must be force to stay with their child! not in any religion, there is no law requiring that they do at least in america, that is really just a social standers at least for that how I see it
2. The fact that if a parent is deciding that they don't wanna be in their child life, then that is probably for the better! Me personally I have a few mental disables and if I didn't want to be in my child life or decide that I wasn't fit to be in it and someone force me to raise said child against my will. Worst case senerio the same type of people that wanna force me to ""take responsibility for my action"" would probably be the first to take the child away if I ended up abusing it.
3. Given the fact that we made child abandonment so easy, any women to my knowledge can leave her baby outside a fire station or police station and they will put it up in foster care or adoption
4. Given the fact that we literally have a group of people that actively encourage abandonment over abortion and encourage single motherhood over abortion
5. The fact that we have organization to help single parent's 

There really is no moral obligation for any parent to be in their child life! but all of this is how I personally feel about the situation, I would love to hear your opinion on this

Dehumanization of women," 

We've all heard stories of a pregnant woman rushed to the hospital in a critical state. She's given the choice to either save the baby, or save herself. She, without shadow of doubt, chooses her baby over her own life. This decision is often praised, other times it's so expected that it's hardly praised. And if the mother chooses her own life over the baby? ...Well, you don't hear those stories, because that woman would be considered selfish beyond redemption and undeserving of her child. Because she wanted the most basic instinctual desire there is: not to procreate, but to live.

I just watched a pro-life vs pro-choice debate, and it got me riled up on this topic. in any other situation, anyone giving up their life to save another is praised for their sacrifice, but saving themselves is considered understandable and even practical. No one will villainize you for saving yourself in a life or death situation. The instant you become a mother, that right is thrown out the window. Starting at conception, a mother is expected to sacrifice everything for her child. Her bodily autonomy, her mental health, her goals, her happiness, her independence, her identity. A 'good' woman, a good wife, a good mother, is most fulfilled when sacrificing herself for her child. And for women who are unwilling? In this world, there are good people versus bad people, and bad people (a.k.a inconvenient people) have their humanity stripped and their needs disregarded. Women who, for whatever reason, would detest the feeling of a baby growing inside of them, are considered bad women.

Their concerns of how to afford pre-natal care, delivery, and childcare, post-partum depression, the agony of delivering an unwanted child, the mental stress of having given life without wanting to, the guilt that a human may now be going through the adoption process without adequate resources or wondering why their parents didn't want them.... all of those concerns no longer have weight because they're the concerns of a bad person. A good person would have been a woman who maybe had doubts about children until she felt the baby growing inside of her, and fell in love with it. Then fell seamlessly into those rumored motherly instincts, later joking with other moms about how she used to think she was never going to have children, but now has three.

It's like you get dehumanized when you become a mother (becoming a symbol of sacrifice), and dehumanized for not being a mother (becoming a symbol of selfishness.) Damned if you do, damned if you don't.",t2_d21m08a8,1641598123,prochoice

An issue with pro-life; Cognitive biases when arguing,"I have noticed during my time in the sub and the debate sub that some fallacies and cognitive bias are very prevalent and spread rapidly due to pro-lifers spreading and teaching them to others.

For example
1. The idea that abortion is ""killing"" has been perpetuated for soo long. So far back in time. Probably ever since people even did abortions. No one really tries to challenge it persay. But rather make reasons for why this percieved ""killing"" is ""acceptable"".

(Illusory truth effect, the tendency to believe that a statement is true if it is easier to process, or if it has been stated multiple times, regardless of its actual veracity).

When you actually think about it... Denying your blood and use of your internal organs to someone, even if it results in death, is not killing.
It's letting die.
There is a moral distinction between killing and letting die. Whereas killing involves intervention, letting die involves withholding care.
The ZEF is recieving (by it's own force) use of blood and organs which is it's life support system.
To refuse further access to your own blood and organs, it dies. = letting die.

Just like if you refused use of your blood from someone else.

2. Pro-lifers when confronted with this usually go straight to the main bias behind this belief;
The omission bias.
By saying ""The action of refusing it/intervening makes it killing!"".
No that's just an omission bias.
Omission bias is the tendency to favor an act of omission (inaction) over one of commission (action).
The omission bias, a cognitive bias, is the tendency to judge overt, harmful actions more severely than harmful omissions. Your brain tricks you into a false sense of morals based on action vs no action.

It is also an action to refuse someone use of your blood or organs or to turn a life support machine off on a brain dead patient. Those aren't killing.

3. After which they just tend to repeat the same bias over and over, doubling down that if action = death, it's killing. And just ignore all the analogies that prove otherwise.
Some make up rediculous false analogies about ""poisoning and stabbing"".

Backfire effect, a tendency to react to disconfirming evidence by strengthening one's previous belief.

4. They will not agree because they truely believe it is killing themselves.

Andrea Dworkin’s relevant passage on the inability of society to recognize the authenticity of female suffering,"“The accounts of rape, wife beating, *forced childbearing*, medical butchering, sex-motivated murder, forced prostitution, physical mutilation, sadistic psychological abuse, and the other commonplaces of female experience that are excavated from the past or given by contemporary survivors should leave the heart seared, the mind in anguish, the conscience in upheaval. 

But they do not. 

No matter how often these stories are told, with whatever clarity or eloquence, bitterness or sorrow, they might as well have been whispered in wind or written in sand: they disappear, as if they were nothing. The tellers and the stories are ignored or ridiculed, threatened back into silence or destroyed, and the experience of female suffering is buried in cultural invisibility and contempt. 

Because women’s testimony is not and cannot be validated by the witness of men who have experienced the same events and given them the same value, the very reality of abuse sustained by women, despite its overwhelming pervasiveness and constancy, is negated. It is negated in the transactions of everyday life, and it is negated in the history books, left out, and it is negated by those who claim to care about suffering but are blind to this suffering. 

The problem, simply stated, is that *one must believe in the existence of the person in order to recognize the authenticity of her suffering.* 

*Neither men nor women believe in the existence of women as significant beings.* 

*It is impossible to remember as real the suffering of someone who by definition has no legitimate claim to dignity or freedom, someone who is in fact viewed as some thing, an object or an absence.* And if a woman, an individual woman multiplied by billions, does not believe in her own discrete existence and therefore cannot credit the authenticity of her own suffering, she is erased, canceled out, and the meaning of her life, whatever it is, whatever it might have been, is lost. This loss cannot be calculated or comprehended. It is vast and awful, and nothing will ever make up for it.”

Anti choice people routinely and without hesitation dismiss women’s suffering even as they claim to acknowledge it. The lack of hollowness that those who respect women feel when anti choice people claim to acknowledge women’s suffering is the empty space where women’s humanity and authenticity of experience would be, if anti choice people considered women to be as human as they consider men to be. We can feel that empty space where women’s humanity and authenticity is supposed to be, and so their claims ring hollow for reasons beyond their inability to empathize enough to refrain from supporting female reproductive abuse. 

This passage (I highly recommend reading Right Wing Women in full, the pdf is available for free online), while relevant to many aspects of female existence, reminded me of anti choicers in particular and the empty space I recognize when I’ve had conversations with them. It’s not that they are always being disingenuous; many times it’s that they truly cannot believe that women are significant beings whose suffering genuinely matters and is authentic.",t2_5kwcwner,1641496742,prochoice

"Im prolife, but im absolutely done with the prolife crowd.","My stance on abortion is simple. Im against it except for medical emergencies or rape. If you were able to make the choice to have sex, then you made the choice to possibly cause a pregnancy. I believe the fetus is a human baby.

That being said, im done with the prolife crowd. My issue isnt with all of them, but most of them. People need proper sexual education so they can make the right choices. People need free and unfettered access to all birth control options. People need all the tools available so they can have safe and smart sex. Most of prolife finds this radical thinking. Hell, many chastise even the idea of people having sex for non-procreatuon issues.

Even though im prolife, 99% of my ideals seem to line up with prochoice. You overall are more accepting of different ideas on how to tackle the issue. I know you arent ""murder hungry baby killers"". I know women don't take abortion lightly. Every myth about prochoice that ive ever been fed, ive found to be a blatant lie through my personal experiences.

The hypocrisy of the so-called “pro-life” movement to which some people belong is astounding. Their determination to protect living cells from the moment of conception stands in stark contrast to their anti-life policies after birth. As these same people noted, the core of the anti-choice movement is white evangelicals; nearly four out of five who supported Donald Trump — the president who forcibly separated children from parents, who let the pandemic spiral out of control killing 240,000 Americans so far, who is arguing for the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act which could end health care coverage for millions of Americans, and who calls the existential threat of climate change a hoax. The anti-choice movement is only “pro-life” when it suits their agenda.

A lot of those hypocritical Conservatives who claim to be ""pro-life"" are pro-war and pro death penalty. So fucking ""pro-life"" of them.

Also, ""Prolifers"" standing outside abortion or sex health clinics shouting abuse at women entering. With zero idea why the women is there. Women who have gone in do to having check ups or life saving treatment are screamed at. But the biggest hipocrasy is pro lifers who have killed doctors, women, nurses and staff due to their beliefs.

Wanting to murder women (and pregnant little girls age 8 to 14 who were raped by pedophiles) for having abortions, even life-saving abortions, locking women and young girls up for having abortions or miscarriages they believe are abortions. So ""pro life"" you execute someone.

Yeah, so fucking ""pro-life"" they'll murdered a pregnant woman who was raped by a man or a pregnant little girl who was raped by a pedophile with the death penalty for the so-called ""crime"" of getting a life-saving abortion, or a mother or adult relative getting their underaged little daughter or niece a life-saving abortion. Yeah, executed for terminating a pregnancy that might kill them or make them invalid for the rest of their lives. So fucking ""pro-life"" of them. Who the fuck gave them the right to sentence someone else's little daughter to death either by child birth or by death penalty for getting a life-saving abortion? Who the fuck gave them the right to sentence some kids' mom to be executed because she got a life-saving abortion so she could stay alive and so her other kids wouldn't have to grow up motherless? Who the fuck do they think they are? Yeah, so fucking ""pro-life"" of them.

Here's a must watch playlist adressing the issue of Conservatives undermining abortion reduction

""Conservatives are undermining abortion reduction and refuse to make exceptions for severe birth defects, life of the mother, child rape victims."":

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzG\_3q50DuPlN\_VQuEIfAJP2gBB-Ptm0T

Playlist description:

""Conservatives are undermining abortion reduction by being against contraceptives, early and comprehensive sex education, better wages (living wage), better health care (medicare for all/universal health care), etc. They constantly undermine abortion reduction, they are not serious about reducing the number of abortion. And they are too stupid to see that a ban would increase and not decrease the abortion rate and the number of unsafe abortions in dark alleys with coat hangers would increase and so would the maternal death rate. More death is not pro-life. And neither is making huge cuts to food stamps and social programs for parents and children in poverty and forcing the woman to have a baby but telling her that after the child is born she's on her own and she can't have food stamps or health care or anything she or the baby might need, that is not pro-life, that's pro-birth.

Also, Conservatives won't even make an exception for child rape victims, when child rape victims are the most in need of a life-saving abortion. Studies show that girls under the age of 15 are 4 if not 5 times more likely to die in child birth. Also, the prime causes of infant mortality is an underage pregnancy, so anyone who deny a child rape victim an abortion, in all likelihood, is damning the child to an early death (it seriously put the poor little girl's health and body at risk, a little child between the age of 9 and 14 is not meant to give birth, a child of that age should NOT be having a baby, especially if we consider the increased risk of death by child birth for children of that age), in addition to destroying the life of the mother. These are girls between the age of 9 and 14 who were brutally raped by pedophiles and Conservatards blame and/or attack the child rape victim or the mother of the child rape victim for getting the child rape victim between the age of 9 and 14 a life-saving abortion.

And what about severe genetic defects like fetal brain damage, congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, having two heads, or having a severe deformity? Nope. Conservatards want no exception for that either, even though the child would have a very short lifespan and/or have very little to no quality of life and would be in excruciating pain all the time or a catatonic vegetable. If that child could talk, he or she would say, ""I hate you for not having aborted me. What kind of life is that?""

How about life of the mother. Nope. Conservatards don't want exception for that either. They want to take that choice away from the woman who might want to stay alive, if anything so her other children don't have to grow up to be motherless. Nevermind that her other children (especially if they're under the age of 18) need her alive, Conservatives don't care about that. No child should have to grow up motherless or fatherless.

Conservatism is cancer on society.

Like most if not all progressive Christians, I support separation of ""church"" and state, freedom of/from religion, anti-discrimination laws for LGBT people and Atheists, and concerning abortion, I definitely support exceptions in case of child rape victim, incest, life of the mother, and severe genetic defect.

Like if the fetus has severe genetic defects it should be aborted. It's cruel to bring a child into the world when it has a very small chance of surviving for long and the days that that child does live will be filled with pain and suffering.

They're telling it like it is:

I always expose the radicals in all parties and hold them accountable (I don't care if they are Conservative, Liberal, Republican, Democrat, I don't care, I can't stand radicals and I expose them and hold them accountable no matter the party) and I'm quite proud of being non-partisan or independent, I don't have a political or denominational affiliation and I don't want one. I can't stand radicals no matter the party. I can't stand those bullshit partisanship games, I can't stand partisan hacks and corporate sell-outs either.

I fucking despise radicals in BOTH parties (the Right-Wing FundaMENTALists of the Far-Right and the SJW FemiNAZIS of the Far-Left) and radicalism is cancer on society. I'm one of the countless people who have had it with the hateful, intolerant, bigoted idiots in BOTH parties.

BOTH the Far-Right and the Far-Left are toxic, harmful, destructive and cancer on society. That's why I expose BOTH because BOTH need to be called out on their bullshit, bigotry, insanity, hypocrisy and double standards. I'm Center-Left and Progressive in my values but for the most part I'm NON-PARTISAN OR INDEPENDENT and I'm fed up with the RADICALS/LOONIES in BOTH parties (the Right-Wing FundaMENTALists of the Far-Right and the SJW FemiNAZIS of the Far-Left).

I'm Center-Left, a survivor of Right-Wing FundaMENTAList ideology, a Progressive Christian (I've been a Progressive for over 10 years now), an Egalitarian Anti-Feminist woman, an advocate for the philosophy of nonviolence and restorative justice (also I find MLK Jr. and Gandhi to be quite inspiring), and bisexual, and I don't apologize for any of it, in fact I'm proud of what I am and what I stand for. Also, I'm the aunt of two young boys age 8 and 6. And I love shows like Secular Talk (with Kyle Kulinski), The Ring of Fire (with Farron Cousin) and The Humanist Report (with Mike Figueredo).

Its should not be a politician, a religious leader or somebody’s choice; it should be the mother who gets the choice either birth it,abort it or something else

"A fetus is definitely human, but that doesn't mean that they are a person. How I justify pro-choice against the claim of murder.","The entirety of most pro-life argument boils down to ""A fetus is an innocent human, and killing that innocent human is murder due to the fetus committing no crime. Murder is bad, therefore abortion is bad"". Situations in which the mother is in extreme danger are often the only okay for pro-lifers.

This is sound argumentation, but it lacks the nuance behind why certain moral positions are the way they are. When people talk about ""human"" they really mean ""person"". While some vegans may disagree with the following, ""Humans"" are superior to animals in terms of sapience, with potentially only a few exceptions. We, as an omnivorous species, [kill animals in a massive scale for foods](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#number-of-animals-slaughtered) that are quite often extravagant and inefficiently produced. 

Many of us have probably heard ""Meat is murder"" from animal rights activists, and if abortion is murder, then surely killing animals for food is too.

Take the following example I have made to try and illustrate why neither eating meat nor aborting a fetus are necessarily wrong.

**SAPIENCE**  

Humans= A 

Chickens= B 

Human fetus= C

Humans are superior to chickens in mental faculty.  

This superiority in mental faculty of humans has passed a threshold of enough sapience to be worth of life as independent beings, while chickens have not.

Humans&gt;Chickens 

A human fetus has less sapience than a chicken. 

Chickens are not sapient and therefore have no right to life. Following this logic, fetuses have no right to life because they lack sufficient sapience, being lower in sapience than something that hasn't passed that threshold. 

Humans&gt;Chickens&gt;Fetus

Therefore ""Humans&gt;fetus""

The example above both justifies the killing of animals for food (At least if its been harvest efficiently and not eaten out of gluttony) and how abortion can be justified as something other than murder. Its done using the same logic.

I would say that this is useful since it shifts the argument from ""**YOU'RE A LITERAL CHILD MURDERER**"" to ""What constitutes a good enough reason to end this creature"". Since we could agree that the fetus isn't valuable due to not being a ""person"", as opposed to a human (which misses the point of human rights), the debate can have some much needed civility. We can also fundamentally be arguing from the same position, instead of having mutually exclusive asymmetrical premises. 

The argument will still fall along the lines of ""Abortion can only be justified in cases of X"", but the main argument of pro-life is fundamentally devalued. The argument for when abortion is okay is now fundamentally based in what can be rationally argued as a good reason.

Note that I, nor this argument, value the notion of women's rights as an imperative. It can be used for what you consider women's rights, in addition with what you consider a good enough reason for killing the fetus, but it is not a fundamental imperative of the theory. I am fully aware that this goes against that little box of information under the ""about community"", but it is still a pro-choice position.",t2_b08k9zk4,1641167384,prochoice

i would like to talk about Morality!,"So right now I am trying to figure out, what is the stander for morality, since  the pro-life side love to argue about morality!

my personal beliefs are that at least how we determine morality is by our society standers on what is right and wrong at whatever time period! what society determine what is right and what is wrong is how we forum our morality! or another way to put it is that morality is with the majority! this could be debatable but right now this is how I see morality! This is the reason why when I get into a abortion debate and the topic of morality come up and the opposite side which is usually gonna be the pro-life side bring up slavery! I make it clear that slavery was moral during the time that it happened! going by today stander we are appealed by the idea of enslaving other people, but back 400 years ago, slavery was morally acceptable so it was moral for the time period. 

So the reason why I wanna talk about morality is because, when the pro-life side said that abortion is immoral or attack us like we are the devil, what dose that say about america morality that 70% of people want roe to stand! if abortion is so immoral then why do 70% of Americans say that abortion is morally acceptable ?",t2_4peg9a81,1641136744,prochoice

"Abortion is murder, so women in their forties should be forbidden from having sex.","Unfortunately, most fertilized eggs never make it to birth. Along the way towards childbirth, fertilized eggs are spontaneously aborted when found to be incompatible with life. One important reason for this is because errors accumulate in our eggs.

We can all agree that abortion is murdering an unborn child. For this reason, abortion should be prevented. It's not just enough to shut down the abortion clinics however. Similarly, if you can reasonably expect that your egg has a very high chance of being spontaneously aborted by your own body, you're essentially guilty of manslaughter.

The risk of spontaneous abortion increases with age. At the age of 22, a woman's fertilized egg has a 8.7% chance of suffering spontaneous abortion. By the age of 48, the unfertilized eggs have suffered from accumulating damage and the womb has become less conducive to life as well. At the age of 48, studies suggest that [84.1% of eggs are spontaneously aborted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC27416/#:~:text=The%20risk%20of%20spontaneous%20abortion,those%20in%20their%20early%2020s.) at some point along the way towards childbirth.

This suggests to me that we have an epidemic of murder: Women around the world in their late forties seem to think that they can safely practice unprotected sex with their husbands, not realizing that they are turning their own bodies into nature's own abortion clinic!

If we could stop women in their thirties and forties from having sex and limiting sex to those between the ages of 18 and 24, statistics would suggest that we will stop many more murders from taking place  than we would from simply shutting own Planned Parenthood.

So yes, it's obvious that a woman who goes to an abortion clinic is a sinful murderess. But worse, our country is filled with murderers: We're faced with an epidemic of people in their forties, who think they have some sort of right to trap the souls of unborn children in fertilized eggs that stand an 84% chance of suffering abortion at some point along the way towards birth.

If I rented you a car without brakes, knowing you stand an 84% chance of becoming trapped in a deadly car accident, you would call me a murderer. Similarly, if you decide to have sex at an age where you can expect 84% of fertilized eggs to be aborted, you're guilty of abortion and thus of murder.

Should Anti-Choicers Be Denied Abortion?,"   ***TRIGGER WARNING! Controversial!***


If/when Roe vs Wade falls should the Anti-Choicers who fought so hard to tear it down and ban and restrict abortion in their respective states be refused abortion in non life threatening circumstances and be made to reap what they sowed?

I'm honestly conflicted on this one. On one hand I'm pro-choice and believe women need access to abortion regardless of reason or gestational stage. On the other hand these people fought so hard and for decades to undo the very right they are traveling elsewhere to exercise. They claimed the only good reason for abortion is when the mother's life is in danger, and preached on and on about how a bodily autonomy doesn't trump a fetuse's right to life. And now you want to come to my state to bypass the laws YOU fought for? Nah man, gtfo. Go take that passion of yours and change the law in your state.

As you can see this is not a black and white issue. What do you guy think about this topic/issue?",t2_2yvv6jxr,1640647749,prochoice

Why do 'pro birthers' claim to be concerned about 'dwindling' populations but do everything that turns people away from having kids,"So, the example I use isn't just the only one, and it isn't just about one person. I saw a Joe rogan video. (I've heard about gun but never seriously watched him( anyways, after about a couple of hours over a few days I saw some of his videos. I think in one of his videos he has complained about how Americans aren't having enough babies. 

Yet the first video that I seriously watched was him talking about how parents should not have parental leave. If I'm too poor to have a kid, why do I want to have a kid then? 

But, like I said, this isn't just about Joe rogan. Its about people who for some reason only focus on making sure women give birth and nothing else. What is your plan? 

Let's say in a magical world no abortions exist, everyone finds abortion immoral. However, that doesn't stop women from giving kids up for adoption. Now what? Like what exactly is going on in your head when you are like, yeah OK, babies are born, no problem, but I'm not gonna pay for their welfare?

Ever seen churches with pro-life banners on them? I'm not entirely sure on this, but I think there is a verse in the Bible where it says something God plants the soul at birth. Mafia members would post a banner that has that verse on it.

What is the best way to respond to this!,"How would you response to this response on why the majority of the time, if a women experience a pregnancy then it's usually the men's fault for ejaculating inside her 

Sure, there is something there when you say, i'd like to have sex, but i dont want to get pregnant, so im going to lower my chances as much as i can, i will diligently take birthcontrol or use and IUD. to increase my chances i could ask my parntner to use a condom, but we both prefer it without, so, instead we have agreed to pull out. So you have sex several times and the first time he fails at pulling out, what do you feel like. Certainly that part was non-consensual, but you most likely wouldn't characterize it as rape, kick him out and call the police. so, what are the chances you become pregnant there, very low, but anything is possible, and you knew that from the beginining, you picked a method that allowed for human error and trusted a partner with it

The reverse could be just as true, if the man's pull out game is strong, and he cleans and urinates before and inbetween, and the felame uses a good BC effectively, they would likely never get pregnant. and yet the man is still relying on the woman to use their BC properly.

its all part of the equation. Maybe the woman is ""innocent"" the first time her partner fails at the pull out method. but she isn't anymore at his 100th failure, its to be expected that forwhatever reason, every time or every 3rd time, hes not going to do it, and she still keeps at it. so yeah, alot of burden falls on the women.

so even if we say the woman in the first scenario has some good excuse as to why its more the man's fault than hers and she became pregnant because of it. Where does that get us. What about all of the ones where everything went just as expected. Pull out game was on point but there was no BC because of allergies. Or maybe a condom burst. or maybe a condom burst and a IUD let one slip. or maybe no one was making any attempt to stop pregnancy from occuring at all, for whatever reason.

if abortion isn't permissible in these scenarios... Is ""my boyfriend failed at pulling out once' really a strong enough argument to kill someone?",t2_4peg9a81,1640411274,prochoice

The time my ex was more pro-choice than me,"In my last relationship, I once informed him of a legislation in a state (I don’t recall where) that banned people from having abortions if their fetus was determined to have Down syndrome. I was relieved initially, then my ex looked at me and went, “That’s not pro-choice.” He explained that not knowing a person’s circumstance(s) and forcing them to have a child with developmental issues was not something to support. I agreed because it made perfect sense: Any reason for an abortion is a good reason. But more importantly, interfering with someone’s decision is wrong. 

I couldn’t believe I had even thought that it would be a good thing to make people have unwanted children, even if it was an out-of-control condition. Last year was when I realized something: my siding with this forced-birth tactic was due to my toxic relative’s public shaming of my pro-choice views in the years before.

but here is the defintion of birth, I try looking for a medical definition

* Passage of the fetus from the uterus to the outside world; the act of being born.
* 2. Specifically, in the human, complete expulsion or extraction of a fetus from its mother, irrespective of gestational age, and regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached.

💥👇🏻Sign Petition against abortion ban in Germany:,"[https://www.openpetition.de/petition/online/passauforchoice-schwangerschaftsabbrueche-am-staedtischen-klinikum-ermoeglichen](https://www.openpetition.de/petition/online/passauforchoice-schwangerschaftsabbrueche-am-staedtischen-klinikum-ermoeglichen) 

The supply situation for unintentionally pregnant women has been catastrophic for decades in all of Lower Bavaria and especially in Passau GERMANY as the main centre of the administrative district. In the entire region, despite 23 clinics, there are only two possibilities to have an abortion performed according to the counselling regulation\* for every 1.2 million inhabitants. Even in a Germany-wide comparison, Passau performs so badly that the satirical magazine of the ZDF, the heute-show, already reported on the restrictive abortion policy ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNIuaXFGyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNIuaXFGyg)).

The legal mandate to provide care is directed at state institutions. But because there is no possibility to have abortions carried out according to the counselling regulations at the clinic of the city of Passau, it depends on individual general practitioners to close this gap. Last year, this meant that between March and November there was not a single practising doctor in Passau and those affected had to travel 120 to 200 kilometres to have an abortion. Even now, only one doctor in Passau performs abortions on an outpatient basis. This is far from sufficient for the city and the district. The city of Passau must ensure that abortions are available at the municipal clinic in order to counteract this massive underuse and to prevent exceptional situations like last year. The provision of abortion services cannot be made dependent on the individual decision of individual doctors, but must be taken into account when recruiting new hospital staff.

A policy that makes access to safe abortion so difficult interferes with the right of self-determination of unintended pregnant women. It also creates social injustice by making the procedure even more time-consuming and costly. With our petition, we emphasise that access to safe abortions is part of basic medical care and a fundamental right. Care must also be supported and secured by the city. We call on those responsible to respect the rights of unwanted pregnant women instead of making headlines all over Germany as a negative example.

We are the Alliance for Sexual Self-Determination Passau, to which 21 Passau organisations, groups and numerous individuals belong, who are working together for the rights of unintentionally pregnant women and an improvement in their medical care in Lower Bavaria. We want to set an example for all regions in Germany where unintentionally pregnant women are still put in avoidable emergency situations by political decisions.

Support us in this and stand together with us for the physical and sexual self-determination of all!💜",t2_5csezv4k,1640114823,prochoice

"Is there a law that forces parents to donate blood/organs/bone marrow etc in order to save the life of their child, and if they refuse face prosecution for child endangerment/wrongful death? (A point that was brought up in a debate that I can't find any sources to verify)","So, I was having a discussion with a friend of mine who is pro-choice politically but personally/morally pro life. My position is that it doesn't matter if you consider a fetus a life or not, it does not have the right to violate the autonomy of the person carrying it. It's immoral to force someone to use their body to sustain the life of another against their will, especially when there is potentially significant risk to their own health. 

To bypass the ""is a fetus a person or not"" debate, which I believe it's not but that's irrelevant for this argument, I brought up the example of not being able to legally compel people to donate their body to save the life of another. Let's say you had a kid, the kid got sick and needed a kidney transplant, and you were the only match, the only option, or the kid would die. Even in that case, even if it posed no significant risk to your health beyond the standard risks of surgery, you can still say no. I also made the analogy if your kid got sick and the only solution was for you to be hooked up to it for 9 months at great risk to your own health, you cannot be legally forced to consent even if it means your child would die. His response to that (one of them) was that it actually is legally required for parents to donate organs and whatnot to their kids if they're able, in order to save their lives, and if they refuse they could face criminal charges. I've never heard of that before, does anyone know if it's true? I tried searching for sources on it but couldn't find anything definitive.",t2_2arnx65v,1640075663,prochoice

If not for honoring the rights of pregnant people, there would be no Unborn Victims of Violence Act.

Yet whenever an antichoicer brings it up, they are trying to justify the removal of the pregnant person's rights with it.

They literally would not have that Act to cite if not for the honoring of the rights of pregnant people to begin with. 

An exchange on Twitter:

*Anti-choicer:  Ever heard of the Unborn Victims of Crime Act?* 

*Me:  That gives juridical personhood because the entity quite literally lacks actual personhood.   And that explicitly states that pregnant people having abortions are exempt from prosecution - that is the only way it could be passed. By acknowledging the rights of pregnant people.*

*Another prochoicer:  Also, the act exists to acknowledge the rights of pregnant people.  If the fetus is killed against the pregnant person's consent, that is a crime because it violates the pregnant person's consent.  The pregnant person is the only one who can choose what happens to their pregnancy* 

*Me:  Exactly, well put. If the pregnancy was terminated against her wishes for it to continue, then &amp; only then  can that act can be used. It's all filtered through the pregnant person. Yet they use the very act that REQUIRES that filtering to try to justifying removing the filtering.  It's classic exploitation. The pregnant person is used to prove a point. Then when the point is made, the pregnant person is expendable and disposed of. Yet another example of using and abusing pregnant people for their goals.*",t2_6gi7y,1639937687,prochoice

Later or “late term” abortion?,"In an ideal country, should later abortions allowed (40-42 weeks?)?

I know they’re super rare, and make up like less than 1% of abortions, but if the person who’s pregnant doesn’t want to be pregnant or changes their mind at the sort of last moment, should they be able to get an abortion? 

Also, here’s the thing, I have seen many gore photos of abortion, and at some point fetuses start resembling a persons face, and I’m a person who’s sensitive to that, and that type of gory imagery disturbs me, even though I don’t look like that type of sensitive person, yet seeing these photos has the socially conditioned negativity around abortion kick in and makes me feel very uneasy and scared.

Is abortion really that Gorey and scary? Especially late term? Or is that just misinformation? Also, how do I get rid of the feeling I mentioned before. Late term abortion really does feel like murder, when seeing the gore photos, and religious nuts will say “that’s because you know it’s wrong.” Is there any way to refute this? How do I get rid of the feeling I described?

Also, personally, even though I’m kinda traumatized by the photos, I still support all abortion. Just wondering what you think I about these questions and would like answers.",t2_ejdetht4,1639893618,prochoice

How I became pro-choice.,"Hello everyone, I’m [17/M]  and my stance on abortions since I started adolescence was that they were terrible. “Killing babies” just felt wrong and vile due to what I learned growing up. I thought laws on banning abortions should be a no brainer.

Until I got a girlfriend. I’ve had a couple pregnancy scares that completely shifted my stance on abortions. The thought of having no control over my future due to an accident would destroy my psyche. Luckily, I live in Canada where if worst comes to worst, abortions are legal without parental consent. I cannot imagine living somewhere where I’m forced to raise a child at my age, it would destroy my future. I have no idea why some think otherwise.

"Climate in TX surrounding abortion, hurt or help to move there?","Hi everyone,

I live in New Orleans, LA and rent.  My house was affected by mold pretty badly after Ida and my property management company lied about doing remediation, just painted over it and refuses to do more so now I have to move.  Preferably as soon as possible because areas still smell moldy no matter how much I clean.  I had a job I loved very much, but of course the contract was outbid after 20 years and moved to Allen, TX two years ago.  (I only worked for them for a few years, I’m 25) They want me to come work for them again badly and to give me a management position for the first time but I’d have to move to TX.  

I of course am completely furious and horrified over the treatment of women in TX and the new laws that have been implemented over the past year regarding abortion.  I’ve been searching every day for months to find a rental here around New Orleans or even 50 miles out and have had no luck.  I have two big dogs and it’s pretty much impossible after Ida.  Id pay double the rent  for a place like I have now with 940 sq ft and a tiny backyard, if I could even find one with a backyard.  From what I’ve heard, Everyone is looking right now and it’s like fighting a pack of nematodes if something does appear, which nothing has that would work for us.  

I’m afraid we are going to have to leave New Orleans if we can’t find a home soon.  I have been avoiding thinking of taking the job that I would love in TX.  But I want to know, in my situation is this something I could fight from within and make a difference if I were a resident?  I know it’s dangerous.  But would I be supporting this ruling by moving there?  Of course I would do everything to denounce it once there but on the other hand people are leaving TX to not support this.  

This is a hard decision because my new job since the contract moved two years ago has made me completely miserable the entire time and we need a new place to live for health reasons but in the end the abortion witch hunt will be the deciding factor for me.  What do you think I should do with that in mind?",t2_23t55z8q,1639662203,prochoice

"""Motherhood is a burden..."" if a someone doesn't want to be a mother","So I tried watching Ben Shapiro, because, you know what, I'm open minded, I still try to see what other people I might disagree with talk about, however, I remembered why I don't watch him (watched him before too). It's because he keeps straw manning a bunch of things. ""There's this feminist lie that mother hood is a burden."" Um, what 'feminist' lie? No one tells you it's a burden. Mean while, people like the Shapiro's say that motherhood is glorious while in the same breath talk about how it's a job. (I'm not disagreeing it's a job) My issue with pro lifers is they don't get it. 

""What do you mean? I love mother hood."" They hate it when the straw woman feminist say 'career women are great because *I* like it, you should like it too!' The problem with pro lifers like this is they use their own experience and think everyone must experience and feel the exact same thing. 

Why do you consider it an insult if I say it's a burden? Being a software engineer, for men or women or other genders, is a burden if they don't like it. Being a parent is a burden... If they didn't want it. 

Again, people like these are not only wanting women (people) to be forced into giving birth but also being mothers. Like if women say they will give their kids up for adoption, pro lifers will still say 'oh you can't just ditch a kid because it's inconvenient!'

I'm a feminist, I don't want anyone forced into careers or motherhood they don't want, but education is the key. No, I'm not lying if I tell you that yes, having a career allows you to leave abusive relationships. Which, brings me to the thing again with (some) pro lifers. Yes, I'm glad people (whether it's Girl Defined, Ben Shapiro's sister Abby etc) are in loving relationships. But stop acting like abuse doesn't exist. 'What do you mean women need work to leave abusive relationships? Men are so loving, you just have bad taste in men'

abortion &amp; insurance question,"hello, right now I’m not 100% sure if I’m pregnant, gonna get tested soon at my college’s health center. I had unprotected sex with my bf two weeks ago and some change. Currently experiencing extreme emotions (crying at inappropriate times) and excessive discharge. That’s pretty much it.  The random crying I’m thinking might have to do with me stopping my Zoloft completely, since I didn’t pick up my last prescription. 


I was wondering if I were pregnant and went to get an abortion, do I have to pay? I am 100% sure I wouldn’t keep it if I was, and my boyfriend and I have already agreed previously that if this happened we wouldn’t keep it. Normally I take birth control, and I ALWAYS take it at the exact time I’m supposed to or a couple hours after. Only reason I was unprotected this time was because there was an issue with my college pharmacy and I wasn’t able to get it on time. Now, I have really good insurance, but I’m pretty sure most insurances won’t pay for abortions. I don’t have any money or a job since I’m currently in college. Boyfriend wouldn’t be able to pay either. I’m 18, so I’m basically living off my parents. I cannot tell my parents, or else I risk losing everything and ending up homeless.

I still have the legal right to leave the child. Guess what? other woman will make the same decision. Now, of course some might keep them. But let's look at the abandoned children. You increase the number of children who are the governments ward. 

But even if no one has given up their child, people who are not ready to be mothers raising kids will have a lot of issues that in turn pass on to their children.

While there are some good arguments from the pro-choice side, sometimes it’s simply not appealing to a pro-lifers mind.

My fellow Pro-Choice people can you tell me why we should be against abortions that are after viability?,"Hello I am pro-choice and I was wondering why we abortion should stop at viability? I fall in with the group that believe abortion should be legal until birth basically. So I am curious, why should we be against abortion after viability or why should their be a cut off point?

From my point of view a fetus is a fetus it doesn't matter if it viable or not, we agree that a women should have a right to her body so it don't make sense (at least to me) to say that a women have a right to abort but only if the fetus is not viable, once the fetus is viable then she should be force to carry it to term. To me the fetus is inside her body and as long as the fetus is in her body she should have the ability to kill it regardless if it's 6 weeks into the pregnancy or 1 day away from being born (assuming she wan't to kill it specifically and not just have the pregnancy ended!).

being pro-choice I thought the idea was that a women should be able to chose what happens to her body and the fetus is not as important as the women, so it baffles me that there are people who are fine with abortion as long as it before viability. again a fetus is still a fetus regardless of the stage that it might be at and it's still using a women's body and we agree that the women is more important so why should viability make any difference?",t2_4peg9a81,1639336729,prochoice

Rant: Pro-lifers’ definition of consent,"I think we’ve all heard “consent to sex is consent to pregnancy before.”

Pro-lifers justify this by saying that you knew that pregnancy is a risk, and therefore you consented to it.

The thing is.. you cannot consent to a possibility of something happening (if anyone disagrees, let me know what you think.)

Consent is permission given for something to occur. Acknowledging that there is a risk associated with this action is not the same thing as an agreement for it to happen. 

They always refute with “Sex is for making kids. You knew what would happen.” Well, sex is actually for more than procreation. Sex can also result in potential STDs, but it’s weird to say that you consented to it. 

You apply this “consent” logic to anything and it will sound stupid. Eating is consent to choking and weight gain. Driving is consent to crashing. 

Everything has a risk, it does not mean I consent to all unwanted consequences. It’s annoying to see people redefine consent to fit their narrative. It reminds me of people who argue that sex is always consensual if you’re married.",t2_gopwbgsp,1639262616,prochoice

How would any private citizen know the development level of the fetus without an intimate knowledge of the person and if not would they be able to use discovery to pull personal medical information some how?  How fetal development is not private information?

I’ve read it’s based off of the first day of the woman’s last period…. Is that supposed to be public knowledge?  What if a woman refuses to track her periods?

He goes on to talk about why this **ISN'T** analogous to pregnancy, and why it doesn't show that the fetus has a right to the woman's uterus - one involves wrongful harm and one doesn't.

Pro birth vs pro life,"As a dutch european its painful for me to see human rights being swiped away from woman/girls/pregnant people. Bodily autonomy is the pillar of health and humanity. Its what we base our social structure upon. Its the freedom over your bodily functions, organs, medical procedures and overall decisions over yourself as a human. Do they view woman as nothing more than vessels? Do they view woman as something else than human? As a walking flesh bag that carries their future (damaged) population?   
We woman have voices, eyes, ears, jobs, opinions, a heart and we happen to carry man's children. The men that dont get any reprocussions by the way. The men, strangers, fathers, rapists, that impregnate but walk free. The men that dont loose a dime or a thought.   


Pregnancy is a medical issue that leaves a permanent physical and mental scar on the womans body. If she even survives without any pre natal, natal or post natal care from the gouvernment.   
Her full bodily autonomy is taken from her. She either carries the child or performs an illigal abortion (with every medical risk involved, even death).   
So, who calls themselves pro life?   
Who is pro life?  
Those people are nothing more than pro birth.   
They dont care about the life of the woman/pregnant person.   
They dont care about the pregnancy or complications of it.   
They dont care about the socio economic status surrounded during/after birth.   


They are the ones that are pro birth.  
But once that baby takes its first breath and the cord is cut, the life of that baby and that mother is not important anymore than it was before.   
They dont care if that baby or mother has medical issues, financial issues, mental issues, social issues, abuse issues or drugs issues. Or anything combined.   
They dont give a shit about life. Not about that of the mother/person nur of that of the baby.   


They are pro forced pregancy. Nothing more.   
When youre pregnant it takes over from head to toe.   
Every organ in your body is involved, everything changes and some things last permanently.   
Its not like the movies. Its not romantic.   
After birth isnt even talked about yet. Post natal physical and mental issues are very serious, even if you were healthy before pregnancy.   


What do you say to that child when it eventually grows up, poor, rich or in the middle?  
""well honey, your gouvernment REALLY wanted you, but your biological mother REALLY didn't.""  
How is that kid supposed to feel about that.   
Forced pregnancy, nothing more.   
Quality of life for both is just out the window.   
I guess the life of that fetus matters more than that of the adult woman/person?  


Bodily autonomy is the pillar of everything we know.   
No man can be forced into any medical procedure. But, now, woman can.   
Woman are sub humans to these ""law makers"". To me, they herd their kettle. They control woman. They decide what happens or doesnt happen in your uterus.   
Its exactly the same if woman would be forced to abort. Its the same. Theres no difference.   
Your gourvernment writes 10 000 dollar checks to snitches. Your gouvernment is a paria.   


Yes its halfway across the earth. But the fact that i do have the freedom over my body and the ability to have a safe abortion is something that should be available to every human on this earth.   
It hits me as close to home as does climate change. I can't control it, but i can speak about it.   
We have to keep talking about it!   
As far as i know there's woman/people walking around in Texas with a fetus in their uterus that they do not wish to have. They have to carry it, suffer for it, give birth to it and raise it just because some men and evil woman thought that they had that control over you. They want your organs, and they have them.   


These babys are the future of Amerika, but you should ask yourself if that is the way you want to build a future.   
A broken future with the message that these children belong to the gouvernment, not to their mothers/other.   


Remember, woman/girls/other have lost their bodily autonomy, but so did their fruits.   


The men in that story walk without consequence, but they are the ones that make those laws and profit from them. They have 50% input but give absolutely nothing.  
They impregnate but feel nothing from it.   
They have children but dont suffer.   
I am done with this. It has to stop unless we want a rotten world.

I have donated to women’s organizations but I want my voice to be heard, I WANT TO DO MORE. I lived in a Christian cult for 27 years since birth and I finally got out a year ago. I am happily married to a wonderful man who supports me. 

I am angry that because of that damn cult I was not able to learn more about roe v wade, I turned a blind eye because I would never be able to get an abortion had I remained a Jehovah’s Witness. But now, I’m out, and I am just learning that abortion has never been a total guarantee here. Attacks have been going on for years. Which, in turn, proves to me that we as women are not seen as equal citizens.

So now what? What do I do?! I have so much to say. I recently discovered an abortion rights activist Amelia Bonow, she only has over 4K subscribers in IG, her message is so important.

The costs of pregnancy,"I'm pregnant and am happy to be pregnant as my husband and I are ready to grow our family.

This is my third pregnancy, which will hopefully lead to a second child and with every pregnancy I become more intensely pro-choice.

About a month ago I was in emergency room for excessive vomiting (due to my pregnancy). Some blood work, one bag of IV fluids, and a single dose of zofran later I recovered and was sent home.

Now comes the bill...$900!!! Which for the United States is probably considered low. Luckily we have great health insurance (the bill was $6500 before insurance kicked in). I'll of course get an itemized bill before I pay.

How can anyone feel that this is ok for a woman who is being forced to carry to term against her will? I also pay $70 per month to my OB. I've already paid $50 for the initial pregnancy blood work. I'll swallow the costs fine because I want the baby but... WHAT THE HELL???? 

I was vomiting every 20 mins for HOURS and we're expecting unwilling pregnant woman to deal with the pain of that in addition to these bills??? F our system.

Unique Anti-Choice Debate,"My parents are very anti-choice and we have debated abortion many times over the years. My mother is in the religious/""it's murder"" camp, but my father (a lawyer) has a unique, simple argument that I haven't heard elsewhere:

1. The government has a duty to protect its citizens
2. That protection must start at some point at the beginning of a citizen's life
3. ""Viability"" is too hard to define/changes over time/is case-by-case (as fetuses develop differently)
4. The simplest/most certain determination is that ""life (citizenry) begins at conception""
5. The government should protect citizens starting at conception
6. Abortion is an attack on a citizen and should be outlawed as part of the government's duty to protect its citizens

"A person should have the right to an abortion, but NOT because they have a right to their body.","Now I’m going to try keep this simple, and hopefully someone replies so I can explain why I think this.

A person should be able to have an abortion because the choice on whether or not they want to go through with the pregnancy should be up to them. After all it is their body and their body is responsible for the child.

However, because their body is responsible for the child that does not mean that the person should be allowed to drink, smoke or fill her body with harmful substances, as it could affect the childs life, and saying that a person should be able to have a abortion because it’s their right to their own body would be allowing them to do that.

I would consider drinking, smoking or having any harmful substances in a pregnant persons body then giving birth to a baby as child abuse. You should be allowed to drink or smoke, but not while it could affect the health of a potential child, especially when you are intending on giving birth to that child.

But at the same time, the choice on whether or not a pregnant person wishes to carry out a pregnancy should entirely be up to the pregnant person, and only the pregnant person.",t2_91i2mvp3,1638794350,prochoice

Would you support a ban on abortion if there was more capital/federal funding and social efforts to overhaul the foster care system and give to pregnancy choice centers?,"I'm currently pro-life and because of the supreme court buzz, I've been trying to work out my own views on the subject. My main question is in the title and I understand what you can go through. You have a girl, 16 years old, little family support, and a boyfriend who isn't prepared to be a father in the least. You feel as though your options are to raise a child with no resources or support and decrease your quality of life OR have an abortion where you get rid of the responsibility and move on with your life. The reason why I am against abortion is that my black, lower-income (or no income rather) grandmother was in this same situation with my father and considered aborting him. I'm glad that didn't happen because he is truly a wonderful and kind man and I am here because of her choice and I am grateful I have a chance at life. I still have to talk to her to get her side of the story but I don't think abortion should be an option in the argument that it will negatively change your lifestyle (I am in favor of it in the cases of rape and incest).

We have moved from a very conservative society to one that celebrates sexual liberation without consequences, good and bad. I think the pro-choice position is selfish in the fact that it is all about the women's choice and her body and completely dehumanizes the child. I've seen posts saying that the fetus is a parasite and is a drag on a women's life and this rhetoric is very weird to me.  Yes, sex is amazing and fun but the very purpose of heterosexual intercourse in all organisms is to reproduce and to go against and to shun biology in this way is baffling to me. The morals in our society have changed in many ways I believe are good as they have given more people access the better freedoms and liberties and in others, I think society has regressed.

Besides viability which will continue to improve due to advances in medicine, the morality and when a life is considered human etc. with continue to be debated because we can truly never know with our current medical expertise. I say we stay to the safe side, but I'm not interested in having that talk here because I know it won't be productive. Nothing is 100%, but I'm for all forms of birth control (a revolutionary invention) that I know of and I don't think abortion is ever necessary because birth control prevents that, from condoms to IUD's to Plan B's which are very effective (up into the high 90 percentile).

In relation to the title, how can you rationalize that it is better to not be born than be born into a less than ideal situation where you have a chance to live a good life? I know our generation is plagued with mental health issues and anxiety so it may feel as though life isn't worth living but we are all here with the internet, friends, family, great food, music we love etc. and I think that's more than worth a chance to experience. I think we take life for granted in many cases.

I think we need to make women feel that have more than two options. That they have a support system, that they are loved, and that their situation matters. I think Planned Parenthood and other organizations help to fulfill this role, but more needs to be done so abortion isn't even an option. 

Also, I have seen rhetoric of abortion being a women's right or it being a privilege and I'm truly curious about the criteria for it being a 'right'. I know that people will say that it is because women have a right to do whatever they want with their body but is that it? Is there any other reason?",t2_4ht41o5b,1638759060,prochoice

Trans advocacy and the current fight for abortion rights,"While I am also an advocate for trans rights, I am feeling pretty triggered currently with how trans activists are trying to push the trans issue into the current abortion fight, insisting people say ""pregnant people"" instead of ""pregnant women"" when referring to abortion. In terms of the political fight, I think it's \*crucial\* that we do not erase gender from this issue, because this is about misogyny, an attempt and an ideology on the conservative (Christian) right that \*women\* should not have control over their own bodies. When we deliberately erase the word ""woman"" from this political fight, we allow the anti-choice movement to sidestep their deeply rooted misogyny in this whole issue, going back generations, an issue that is widespread across the world, where the patriarchy controls women and doesn't allow them to make decisions about their own fates. This issue is very much about gender, and the fact that a miniscule number of trans men can also get pregnant does not change that when anti-choice people discuss abortion, they think of biological women and their attitudes toward a woman's right to agency. This is not the political area for trans people to insist on centering their struggle, because the abortion fight is a feminist struggle against misogyny. Trans folks are welcome to join the fight, and of course abortion affects them too, but they are harming the fight when they completely erase the word women from the political discussion, and center gender neutrality in a deeply feminist issue, at the expense of the feminist cause.   


It's like if the police were targeting a black neighborhood with nightly raids, but because there happened to be two white households in the neighborhood as well, those white people insisted that the whole race issue be removed from the conversation, and instead of saying police were targeting ""a neighborhood of black people"", we should say they were targeting ""a neighborhood of people"" simply to be more inclusive. The fact remains that it's 99.9% cis women who have or may need abortions, and that the overturning of Roe v. Wade is misogyny, a bunch of men and Christian conservatives who believe women should be baby machines and property of men. I'm starting to really resent the trans people who keep jumping on women online who use gendered language in their outrage about this horrible moment in history. It is very much a gendered issue. I'm sorry, but it is. If it was (cis) men who got pregnant, the notion of laws to prevent them from making their own reproductive decisions would not be in question. But the attitudes toward women, the systemic misogyny, is what drives this policing of women's bodies. I won't strip gender from my protests, because I will not let the other side avoid looking at their misogyny. This is not a gender-neutral issue. This is a war on *women.* I celebrate trans folks' rights, but this is not the issue to co-opt for the trans cause. Misogyny and the oppression of women based on their sex still exists and needs to have room to be centered when it is appropriate (like now.) And if women succeed in getting their rights to abortion, those few trans men who need abortions will automatically be included. Sorry, just had to vent this.",t2_14w2pt,1638755777,prochoice

I grew up in rural Texas you know the type, the holier than thou Christians everywhere. My family was rather poor but we got by. I had an older sister, She was really sickly but she managed to get by. My sister got pregnant by her boyfriend at sixteen we had no idea how she would handle the pregnancy I asked if she would consider abortion but the odds weren't in our favor. due to the distance and cost, there was not much we could do. My community shamed her it was horrific, and her body could not handle the pregnancy well she had to miss school and was bedridden for weeks. She went into premature labor and lost the baby and she passed a few weeks later. As you can imagine I am rather traumatized over the whole situation.

When I see these old men deciding the fates of millions of women do they not care.

I've done a lot of the same stuff that many of you reported doing, just getting pissed, looking to blame people (Hillary, the DNC, the voters, Trump, etc.), and trying to extrapolate what this ruling, when it comes, would mean for the future.

I had moments of indignant heel digging and courage screwing (""fuck those rubes, we'll beat them again; this is our country""), and canary in the coal mine bargaining (""corporations will pull out of these states, that'll show em!""), the doom scented kiss of darkness (""soooo, same sex marriage is next, then who knows what?""), and then even a requisite ride on the Arc of the Universe hope rollercoaster (""Gen z will save us. Ready the tiktok signal! The arc of the universe _has_ to bend, right?"")

And then I reached the last stage, acceptance (I also lifted some weights and ate a Reese's peanut butter tree, whatever). I realized as other writers have noted, this is not a new strategy or a new thing. This was always the long game of the authoritarians, and now we're seeing, when it's already too late, what they're planning.

And yes, this is a take that comes from an extremely privileged place, but hear me out: those of us who can move out of the US, should move out and try to get others out who don't have the privilege to make this move on their own.

I'm not saying ""time to flee"", I'm saying, if there are countries out there who actually value women's lives more than the US and protect reproductive freedom, maybe we should just go there. I know easier said than done, but I think it might be time to just let these rubes do what they will and get as many people, companies, and minds out of the country as possible. 

I'm tired of the pendulum swings that involve the rights of marginalized people. I'm tired of facing people who want us to live a life that would make us profoundly unhappy. I want to stop fighting about abortion, same sex marriage, and healthcare with people who hoover horse paste in a global pandemic. 

This country has always been right wing, I guess; maybe we should just let them be and go live somewhere else and take vulnerable people with us and maybe some of the companies that agree with us.

Maybe the only way to really stop these chuds is to just leave?

Pro-Life Argument that I can’t refute.,"I’m on a fence here. On a legal level, I can’t definitely label myself as Pro-Choice or Pro-life. But I do hold a modernist perspective, so I do believe somewhat in an objective moral set, and I find abortion to be objectively immoral. I don’t think that there is much discussion there, and the only refutation could be through a postmodernist perspective, which may be valid, but I am yet to hear of one that matches the Aristotelian Ontological Argument. But I also believe that just because I find abortion to be immoral, it shouldn’t necessarily make it illegal. 

I do have an open mind, and again, because of what I said just before, I can’t take a definitive stance against either Argument on a purely legal level. But I am hoping that someone on here can at least challenge this Aristotelian thought. I am really interested in what you all have to say. 

This is my best understanding of the Philosophical argument against abortion, but I might have a very simplistic understanding. But here is my understanding of it:

Related to: Aristotelian Pre-Modernism and his understanding of Form vs. Matter, providing the philosophical basis for the Ontological Argument. 

Prefaced Example:

An acorn has the potential to become an oak tree, but that potential can only be actualized as a result of the acorn being acted upon by such external factors as sunlight and water. And the nutrients present in the soil in which it's planted.

The meat and Potatoes:

Aristotle believed that what is true of the acorn is true of you and I. Each of us is a combination of Matter and Form. The Matter of which we are composed explains what is unique or particular about each of us, and our Form explains what we have in common, what constitutes our essential human-ness. 

Each of us is a combination of Matter and Form. That combination forms a unique substance which we call by a name. It is the potentialities built into the human Form that define or limit the ways in which we can change/develop in accord with our essential nature. [Note that it's not possible for a thing to fulfill all of its potentialities, as they can
sometimes be in conflict with one another.]

So... 
If hylomorphism is true, then it's your Form that makes you human, and it's the potentialities inherent to that Form that define and distinguish what it
means to be human. So you are fully human by virtue of possessing those potentialities, regardless of the extent to which you actualized them, and you possess them the moment Form is instantiated in Matter, to become the unique Substance that is you.

So, in conclusion, you are human, and fully so, from the moment of conception.

And as I see it, a summary of the argument is such:

Each person is born with potential. And a person becomes born upon conception because it is the creation of the “substance”, as Aristotle puts it, or the ultimate combination of Matter and form (matter being the “cluster of cells” and the form being  (in a completely oversimplified and misconstrued term, because I am not religious) “soul”. And if the “Form” is the driving factor of potentiality, and the conception is the birth of the substance, than you have inherent substance upon conception. And therefore, you are fully human upon conception, making abortion of any kind, resulting in the removal of that potential, akin to death; Complete removal of all potential is death. And to abort a fetus is to kill a human.

Clumps of cells,"We are all clumps of cells. I am a clump of cells and you are a clump of cells. The embryos and fetuses are also clumps of cells. The main difference of these clumps is sentience or cognitive function. We can see that the fetus is not yet sentient until the 18th week. So what are people trying to protect? They are protecting a non-sentient clump of cells. Aside from that, we should be able to have other things such as embryonic stem cell research.

Personal Inquiry into the Pro-Choice Position,"So I wanted to get to better understand the pro-choice community and how people in it think, and perhaps the variations of opinion so I have composed a set of 9 questions, no right or wrong answers, just wanting to better understand the world view of pro-choicers so I would be very greatful if you were willing to take your time to answer the questions.

Section 1

What inspired you to support this position?

Do you believe in the principle ""my body my choice""? If yes or no, why?

Do you view abortion as more euthanasia or do you view it as a more simple removal of unliving tissue? If neither, why?

Section 2

How do you define a living person?

What does life mean to you?

What do you think of Pro Life people and their position?

Section 3

What do you have to say to the quote ""everyone who supports abortion has been born""?

What does the concept of having been aborted make you think and/or feel, as in, what if you had been aborted?

What do you think of the idea that a fetus is its own body?",t2_dtxsh4iq,1638632553,prochoice

I am a man with the ability to get pregnant. This will effect me. If abortion rights are terminated (pun intended) it will effect me. A man.

I am little pro choice &amp; a little pro life?,"To preface what I'm about to discuss I want everyone here to know that I come here truly in good faith and I'm not here to stir the pot. I honestly want people to help shed some light on this issue for me so I understand this better. To add further I'm a 25yo white male although I'm not straight nor Christian; just in case folks ended up asking because I know that sometimes personal identity &amp; background can be a factor in one's POV on a situation like this.

I understand the bundle of cells argument which I can't disagree with the science on that and I am sympathetic to circumstances including rape, incest, and health of the mother. After those criterion are met, at what point do we recognize it as human life? I know at 21 weeks a baby can be viable outside the womb in premature births yet some states allow the threshold beyond that. Excluding of course in situations where the health of the mother and of the child are in peril, I truly believe that is extremely sad and the thought of it makes me cry. So at 21 weeks it surely then is a living entity, a human baby, and the thought that this baby could be legally aborted at 21 weeks actually breaks my heart. 

I respect &amp; agree with abortion rights but it gets increasingly harder for me the later it is &amp; when there's an actual child. 
If 21 weeks it can live outside the womb is it not a human baby at 20 weeks? Where is the line drawn?

I know pro choice people aren't a monolith but is there at least a consensus or point where people here feel uncomfortable with the idea? (Except in cases of risk of life &amp; health etc.)

I am not anti abortion but I'm also not anti pro life at a certain point. All I want to know is at what point do you consider it to be a baby and not just a bundle of cells.",t2_7z1o2nxj,1638579771,prochoice

Why I did it.,"I had a hysterectomy this year. At 23. 

Now, this was largely due to medical issues. I have never, ever wanted children, since I was 12. While I don't even identify as a woman (Non-binary AFAB), and I was able to keep my ovaries to avoid hormonal changes, I still felt a sense of loss. A loss of femme energy or whatever you want to call it. The procedure did work, and I'm not in pain anymore, and I'm happy I did it. But there's a lot more that went into that decision.

When I was 19, I was raped. I was not on birth control. I was fortunate enough that I had the foresight to immediately drive to the nearest pharmacy and get plan B. I never reported it because I was in a sexual relationship with the rapist, and no one would believe me.

I could have tried more muscle relaxers. I could have tried more birth controls. I could have even tried an ablation, all less invasive and costly than a hysterectomy. My procedure was right after the Texas Abortion Ban passed. I had a doctor who was willing to do it to end my decade of missing work and school because of the pain. I went headfirst for a hysterectomy, because I thought about all the people who would have to carry their rapist's fetus. Then I thought about myself. What would have happened if I wasn't able to go get Plan B an hour after it happened? What would happen if I, someone who was already struggling with mental health and physical health issues, had to carry my rapist's fetus?

Then I began to wonder what would happen if I was ever raped again. Birth control and ablations fail. My boyfriend is most likely sterile, and even offered to get a vasectomy if my hysterectomy was denied by insurance, but that wouldn't protect me against someone else. So I fought. And I won.

I went immediately for the most extreme, invasive measure because I was scared. I didn't want to do it yet. I wanted more time to think about it. I wanted to finish the semester and have the procedure done over winter break. But then that disgusting bill passed...and I had surgery on the first day of school.

Hi, I'm Bun. I had a hysterectomy at 23 instead of exploring other options because I was scared. Because it's only a matter of time before none of us have a choice.",t2_3j3bchoj,1638566629,prochoice

Child abuse as a talking point is weak,"I just came across a talking point in the service of the pro-choice cause on another platform that enraged me, and I am pro-abortion rights. This woman was recounting the story of a teenager she knew who was forced to carry a pregnancy to term. She had to give up her child to relatives who ended up abusing him. She concluded by regretting that the young woman didn't have a choice, and that the child was growing up full of sorrow and rage. She was essentially implying that it is better to not exist at all than to be an adult who was abused as a child. 

As a kind and highly accomplished person who gives a lot to the world, and who happens to be in recovery from Complex PTSD from child abuse (and a wanted child, if you care--life is almost always more complex than the schemas we use to understand it), I found that a really sick way to wrap up a political talking point. Of course it was well intentioned. Well meaning people are perfectly capable of being thoughtless and solipsistic. I realized that the poster could only empathize with the teen mother, not the abused child, who was the unappealing result of a thought experiment she couldn't quite compute.

There are obviously better ways to argue for abortion rights than to imply that not existing at all is better than being an abused child. If the rates of CSA are 1/4 for girls and 1/6 for boys as I so often hear, and children are also abused in ways that aren't sexual, it is HIGHLY likely that you know many people who were abused as children.",t2_54y4t44y,1638541143,prochoice

The Pro-Choice Abortion Study Sheets!,"Hello there everyone!

If you are wondering what this post is, this is the 'Pro-Choice Abortion Study Sheets'. I spent around the last 6 months commenting, posting, saving other people post and comments &amp; question onto different subreddit so I can obtain information on abortion and be a better debater in the discussion and just be more intelligent. Now I believe I am close to gathering all the info I would ever need so I want back to all my post and save history and gather all the useful post (or the one I deemed useful) and put them in one place!

However since there are and will be new people getting into this topic and since keeping track of all the information, question and discussion on this topic is hard, I think it will be better to share this with everyone so in the future when a person have a question they can check this post to see if their question might have been answer already!

so a few thing mention

1. The purpose of this study sheet and these post (at least for me the creator) is just to be begging of well researching. I made this whole sheet with the idea of it being a starting point for your research and not for it to be the place where you get the answer. There are a good chuck of these post where if you read the post or go the comment section you could just obtain the answer you probably are looking for, that in't why I made the post
2. 62/110 of these post are post that I made myself, that I found to be somewhat useful and was worth putting on here mine.
3. With the second point in mind since writing was never really my strong suit, some of my post might be difficult to read or understand. if that is the cases then that is fine, I more then likely put the post on here because of the comment section! I probably felt like the comment section would have been good for research then the actual post itself and if you have an Arianism reading some of my post then I apologize
4. In order to make it easy to actually study and do research I separated the post into different category. Remember there was 110 post so thank me!
5. The Last thing I wanna say is that I made this entire guide to help the Pro-Choice side, it is 100% bias because I am Pro-choice, so if you are on the Pro-life side or in the middle then don't expect this to favor the Pro-Life side or be neutral much if at all. I think a few post would be consider neutral here but the vast majority at least in my eyes are to help the Pro-Choice side

I am trying to take solace in the fact that most abortions take place under 15weeks gestation. 15wk might become the new cutoff point- source info &amp; thoughts in post,"&gt;	“If you think that the issue is one of choice, that women should have a choice to terminate their pregnancy, that supposes that there is a point at which they’ve had the fair choice,” he said, and went on to question why 15 weeks would be an inappropriate line. “Because viability, it seems to me, doesn’t have anything to do with choice. But, if it really is an issue about choice, why is 15 weeks not enough time?”  - Chief Justice Roberts 

&gt;	Chief Justice Roberts also questioned Mississippi’s solicitor general, Scott Stewart, about whether the “viability” line was really central to Roe, as the court said it was in the 1992 case reaffirming abortion rights. The chief justice noted that fetal viability had not been part of the legal arguments in Roe, and noted that the once-confidential papers of Roe’s author, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, suggested that putting the line at viability was arbitrary.

[Roberts Searches for Middle Ground in Abortion Case](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/us/politics/abortion-supreme-court-mississippi.html)

Because of medical advances, it is possible now a fetus can survive out of the womb. Most abortions are before 15wks. That is (some of) the reasoning.
[Abortion Surveillance—Findings and Reports 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm)

&gt;	The majority of abortions in 2019 took place early in gestation: 92.7% of abortions were performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation; a smaller number of abortions (6.2%) were performed at 14–20 weeks’ gestation, and even fewer (&lt;1.0%) were performed at ≥21 weeks’ gestation. 

The number significantly declines, the farther along the pregnancy is. Will the new regulations take into account of medical issues/complications? This one, I really hope so.

I hate what is happening. I don’t accept it, but I am trying to come to terms with it. Seems I have no choice but to. Best believe I’ll celebrate if Roe stays (All of us will). But I’ll at least be glad it isn’t banned before 15wk",t2_47mcn020,1638470302,prochoice

Honest question,"So I’ve been thinking about this for a little bit. If the ProLife argument is that life starts at conception and that the fetus is a life, then why does the government, that have followed that logic, not give benefits to those children. Let me explain, you’ve got a lot of families receiving some kind of government benefits correct? Most government benefits increase when you have dependents to pay for correct? If a fetus is considered a child then why would those families not be able to do things like 1) claim they have a child and receive higher welfare or 2) receive a tax break for having a life that you have to care for 3) many jobs don’t allow maternity/paternity leave until closer to the birth of the child but if you have to go for something like an ultrasound then you are not allowed to use maternity leave, etc. I guess my point is that if you say that the fetus is a life then it should get all of the benefits of being alive (being considered a citizen) but if a fetus is not considered to be a citizen yet then it shouldn’t be considered a life….Assuming we’re following the idea of the fetus being an American at the point of “life”.

I guess prolifers were lying when they said we become mothers at conception and that abortion just makes us the mother of a dead child,"[https://www.businessinsider.com/amy-coney-barrett-asks-safe-haven-laws-solutions-unwanted-motherhood-2021-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/amy-coney-barrett-asks-safe-haven-laws-solutions-unwanted-motherhood-2021-12)

&gt;Those in favor of upholding the law are saying that parenthood is no longer an undue burden. When questioning the attorney for Jackson Women's Health, Justice Barrett inquired about [adoption laws removing the burden of parenthood](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/12/amy-coney-barrett-abortion-adoption-comments.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;""I have a question about safe haven laws. You can terminate parental rights by relinquishing a child after giving birth. The cases emphasized the burden of parenting. But women don't have to parent if they don't want to! Why don't safe haven laws take care of that?"" asked Barrett, who [has seven kids](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/12/supreme-court-nominee-amy-coney-barrett-has-seven-kids-dont-you-dare-forget-it/), two of whom are adopted. 

I'll point everyone back to the title now.

They'll lie and say whatever sounds good to a listening ear in the moment, but when you tie different ends of their arguments together, they defeat their own arguments with their own arguments. 

Here's another example:

""Well you had sex! You knew the consequences of your own actions.""

Also them: ""Pregnancy resulting from rape shouldn't be allowed to be aborted because it's not the baby's fault.""

And I don't care how much someone has smoothed these points over. I don't care if someone says that it doesn't matter if they are religious, that they use secular arguments to defend their position. 

You wouldn't have as strong of a prolife movement if not for religious organizations pushing this. You wouldn't believe what you believe if not for historical precedent of *centuries* of the oppression and subjugation of women and afab, and use of religion to do just that. To ensure men's rights over our bodies. Which has now just changed to ensure children's rights and state's rights over our bodies, which they obfuscate by trying to erase that they are trying to control our bodies. 

What other contradictory statements have you found in prolife ideology?",t2_6gi7y,1638425724,prochoice
"If a mother wants to abort a child but legally isn’t allowed to, how do you think that child will be treated?","This is a point I haven’t seen anyone bring up. Being forced to have something makes you less likely to take care of it than if you wanted it. This is true for pretty much anything, including children. Making a child live a life where they are less likely to be loved is cruel, and I’d argue they’re better off not being born in the first place. 

I’m making this post because the pro-choice arguments I’ve been seeing are becoming repetitive and aren’t convincing as many people. Unfortunately, many people don’t believe the living woman’s choice matters more than the unborn fetus. So it’s time for a change in strategy. 

Most pro-choice people are Republican, who tend to take a tougher stance on crime and drugs. By allowing abortions, you decrease the amount of children growing up in unloving homes. Children who grow up unloved or in poverty are more likely to turn to crime and drugs. 

Remember, you need to make it clear that abortion rights benefit more than just women. As a man, I think they’re super important because I myself don’t plan on having kids anytime soon. And if a couple cannot financially support a child, why force them to take on that burden that will make the child miserable as well?",t2_4yhc2wlv,1638423890,prochoice

"""I'm not pro-life for religious reasons, im an advocate of SCIENCE. And science says its a human life from the moment of conception.""","I recently watched a YouTube debate on abortion where an anti-abortion women used this phrase, which I'm sure many of us have heard before. 

But as far as I'm aware ""moment of conception"" is not a scientific thing, right? It's sort of a vague umbrella term to casually refer to the period of time between fertilization and the cell eventually latching on to the uteran wall. 

And I thought to myself, well by ""conception"", they probably mean fertilization, but then I thought about how often a fertilized egg doesn't implant in the uterus and is passed. In these situations, would medical or scientific professionals actually consider that a pregnancy? I suspect not, but I wanted to see if anyone could offer some clearer insight.",t2_t4rw7,1638412302,prochoice
I had an argument with a woman who said late term abortions are done because the mother no longer wants to be pregnant,"There was a post on the pro life page (idk why i get notifications) that said a woman had an abortion at 29 weeks because shed found out she was pregnant after using birth control. 
I said abortion after 24 weeks was because the fetus or the mother were at danger/ or dying. She told me i was wrong and gave me two sources. One i didnt read because it was from an institue. The other was about a doctor who performed ""late term abortions"" on women who found out that their babies had fatal birth defects. She told me i clearly didnt read the source because it stated he admitted to performing later abortions on women who no longer wanted to be pregnant.
I told her that i wasnt from the us and i had gotten my information from a doctor. She asked where i was from and that she knew she could prove me wrong. I told her id believe a doctor over a random lady in reddit. She then went onto say that not all abortions are performed because lives are at risk, some are performed because the fetus isnt wanted.

She continued to say that she had proved me wrong, while not actually proving me wrong all because i wouldnt provide sources for my information. Like sorry, am i meant to go and wake my doctor up and tell her i need her to repeat what she told me for some middle aged pl on reddit?",t2_fzprzfpd,1638411699,prochoice

Sure, they don't say it in so many words, but they want to misconstruct the argument. 'Science says that it's a human life'. We know, that's not the issue. 

It's dishonesty and pretty scummy.

SCOTUS Rally — Escalation By The Antis,"I was at the rally at SCOTUS this morning, my third abortion SCOTUS rally. Of course there are always plenty of antis there, there always are. In past events they have stayed on their side and us on ours. Not so today. A very aggressive contingent of the most hateful antis swarmed our side, surrounded us with their enormous disgusting artists’ renderings of what they imagine an abortion is like, and spewed hate and fire and brimstone at us through the loudest bullhorn money could buy. Like, literally screaming at us that we are murderous whores and fornicating harlots. 

It was fucking awful. This extreme escalation by the antis is concerning. They were a hair’s breath away from advocating violence, and it was scary and disgusting and infuriating. They have no interest in debate or discussion, and they said explicitly that they didn’t care what we thought or what the Court did. They just wanted to blast their hate at us as loud and hard as they can. Next time I’m bringing earplugs.",t2_4feg5qel,1638381558,prochoice

"""So you think it's better if I never existed""?","This is something that gets under my skin whenever I hear it. When pro-lifers who were conceived through rape try to guilt trip you by saying ""so you think it would have been better if I never existed?""
Well, here's my answer. Yes, I think it would have been better if you never were conceived you know why? Because then that means your mother never would have been raped. Are you happy to be alive? Well, you should thank your rapist father for impregnating your mom. 
If you could go back in time and 100% prevent your mom from ever being raped would you do it? If you love her then you would. Oh but wait, you wouldn't exist then. Do you want to prevent a horrific crime from happening to your mom or do you think it should happen to her just so you could come into existence!

Help investigative reporters find out what crisis pregnancy centers are doing with women's personal health information,"Hello there, folks. My name is Byard Duncan. I’m a reporter with [Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.](https://revealnews.org/about-us/)

We’re investigating the relationship between anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers” and patients’ data security. Although these facilities often *resemble* licensed medical clinics, they aren’t always required to follow health privacy laws that strictly regulate how personal health information is collected and shared. As a result, people seeking abortions can hand over data they wrongly assume is protected by law.

We want to find out what happens to that personal info after these clinics get ahold of it. So we’ve built a digital form to ask women what happened after their online or in-person visits. Did they see strange ads on social media? Were they contacted via phone or text?

**This is confidential. We guarantee that we will never publish any names, personal information, or details of anyone’s experience without their consent. Only a small group of Reveal reporters and editors will have access to full responses.**

Debunking Anti-Choice Arguments,"These are some common anti-choice arguments I've come across, and my responses to shut them down. Feel free to use in any of your arguments 

**Antichoice argument 1:** ""When you have consensual sex you welcome the sperm into your body""  

**Rebuttal**: When having sex one can easily employ methods of contraception to prevent sperm from invading the body. By taking measures to ensure that sperm does not enter your body, you're not consenting to the act of sperm entering your body. You're just consenting to sex.  

**Antichoice argument 2**: Actions have consequences. If you consent to sex, you are consenting to the risks of having sex. Therefore you are responsible for any undesired result.  

**Rebuttal**: Being responsible for an undesired consequence doesn't mean you consented to it happening when you took the risk, nor does it mean that you aren't allowed to fix the situation. Otherwise a doctor could refuse to treat someone who accidentally broke their bones while riding a bike because they consented to breaking their bones when they consented to riding a bike. When an undesired consequence occurs, you are responsible for fixing the situation. In the case of an undesired pregnancy, you fix that situation with an abortion. 

**Antichoice argument 3:** Sperms are mindless, it has no choice but to swim towards the eggs because that is what it's genetically programmed to do. It's not making a conscious decision therefore you cannot refer to sperm as unwelcome invaders. That's like blaming a knife for stabbing someone rather than the person who used the knife to do the stabbing. 

 **Rebuttal**: Just because sperms aren't self aware doesn't mean they aren't unwelcome invaders. Viruses aren't self aware, nor are parasites or bacteria. But when they invade our body, we have the right to seek medical help to kill the invaders. They are living organisms capable of their own movements, a knife isn't. Therefore women have the right to go to a clinic for an abortion when the fetus invades her body. All living organisms have a will to live and multiply, so the mother is the victim and the sperms that entered her body are the invaders. 

 **Antichoice argument 4:** The entire purpose of sex is to produce children, therefore pregnancy cannot be the undesired result.  

**Rebuttal**: That is the biological purpose of sex. However, people do not have to follow the biological purpose of sex. People can simply have sex for pleasure.",t2_gc23ulju,1637686613,prochoice

I guess I want to know I'm not alone in thinking this,"I'm pro-choice/pro-abortion. I have an IUD. My state has a 20 week ban, which is pretty reasonable-ish. I get overly worried about things sometimes. Depending Texas and December and who knows what else, who knows if my state will go 6 weeks or if Roe V Wade will just be trashed all together. 

With my IUD, I don't get a cycle at all. If my state goes 6 weeks, there is no way I would ever know by 6 weeks (which should be called 2 weeks or 1 week if you ask me, but no asks me these things). 

Am I the only woman who feels like if the option for a safe legal abortion goes away, then an IUD alone won't be enough? Or am I just being paranoid? I have never wanted kids, and I never want kids. I do not want to be pregnant, I do not want to give birth, I know how traumatizing the adoption system is in this country, and I do not want anything to do with being a mother. 

Honestly, all of these bans are making me wonder if I should get myself sterilized AND keep the IUD, just to be extra overly sure. I've also talked to my long-term boyfriend about if own local laws change then maybe he gets sterilized AND I keep the IUD (again, extra overly sure). He is open to the idea; he also never wants kids and has already said that he plans to get sterilized at some point anyway.

Common Pro-life False Illogical Arguments,"1. Self-defence can only be used in response to a violent crime.
A. OBVIOUSY false. If someone touches me without consent in a way I dislike, I can remove their hand from me. That is self-defence without a crime having being commited.

2. False Analogies; If you are in a boat you can't kick someone out of your boat into the ocean.
A. Pro-Lifers only use false analogies because if they used ones actually applicable, it would fail for their cause. No ones body, organs or blood is being used. That is what makes it a ""false Analogy"". These are the only anologies they use, false ones.

3. Consent to sex is consent to pregnancy/zef.
A. NO. Consent to person A (man) is not consent to person B (fetus). Two seperate people.

4. Consequences and causal effect = consent to a pregnancy.
A. No. This is missuse and bastardization of the term ""consent"". Consent is a permissional agreement between  PEOPLE. Consequences is not consent, nor is causal effect. They are unrelated.

5. Abortion is murder.
A. No. If abortion is legal, it straight away cannot be constituted as murder. Murder = premeditated illegal killing. Abortion is legal therefore it is not murder.
Abortion is also self-defence and letting die so cannot be murder on that front either. It is not murder if someone dies because I refuse to let them continue using my blood.

6. The woman forced the Zef into a state of dependency.
A. No. It implanted without her consent, like a parasite. So by all biological counts, it forced itself to be dependent on her the moment it implanted. Before that point it wasn't dependent.

7. Consent is irrelevant because pregnancy is a biological process. Its like eating food then saying it has no consent.
A. No, when people are involved and violating your body, consent is required. Even if it is natural.
Food isn't a person/human and has no actions, so consent is irrelevant to food.

8. Abortion is lethal self defence and can only be used if the woman's life is in danger.
A. Nope. Removing unwanted internal contact of a zef is not lethal self-defence. It dies due to its own inviability. You don't need to be in life threatening danger to remove unwanted contact.

9. Abortion is killing.
A. If I refuse someone use of my blood and organs, that's not killing. Refusing someone life saving intervention and refusing to donate = letting die. Just because it dies does not mean its killing, nor that it's unethical.

10. Abortion bans stop abortion.
A. No, both logically and statistically it can be seen, womem just order online abortion pills and go out of state for abortion.",t2_5vlvig8t,1637647722,prochoice

Question: Does abortion 'inequality' concern you?,"The abortion rate (per 1,000 15-44 y/o females) is 4× as high among black women than among white women in the United States. Pro-choice people seem to accept the idea that abortion is quite intertwined with poverty rates. However, when these poverty rates and abortion rates don't match (as they don't in many instances in the U.S.), does this concern you? In a more direct example, suppose the racial makeup of the United States was 85% white and 15% black and the makeup of abortions were 85% on black women and 15% on white women. Would this concern you? Would it concern you if demographic statisticians at the Census Bureau projected that, at the current rate of mortality, natality, and pregnancies, the racial makeup of the U.S. would be 98% white and 2% black, in a matter of 5 years? Would this be of concern? If so, what legislative actions do you feel would be appropriate to address this?",t2_2b27n74u,1637632129,prochoice

The Problem With the Washington Post’s Glowing Coverage of “Maternity Ranches”,,t2_n6epl,1637179783,prochoice
"The pregnancy parasite thought experiment: what if a pregnancy ""paused"" permanently?","This thought experiment specifies a situation where the following are true:

* A woman - let's call her Jane - is pregnant 21 weeks, the latest a pregnancy can get with the baby still having a 0% chance of survival if birthed.
* The pregnancy is intentional, and Jane stills want a child.
* Jane's pregnancy is ""paused"", meaning the baby cannot develop any further.
* Jane will remain pregnant until either the pregnancy is terminated, or she dies.

There are a few different possible responses I can think of that people would have to this situation:

* Most anti-choicers would probably repeatedly tell Jane to wait to see the pregnancy unpauses, regardless of the chances of that happening.
* Other anti-choicers may tell Jane to give the baby a ""long life"" in her womb.
* A few anti-choicers may ask Jane questions like, ""What if you are pregnant with the second coming of Christ?""
* If the father is strongly anti-choice, Jane may have no outcome with any level of relief.
* If Jane maintains the pregnancy, she may eventually die or commit suicide from the stress it places on her body and mind.
* I wouldn't be surprised if eventually Jane's maternity leave was revoked based on some loophole, for the government to save money.
* *Obviously*, the consequences of any outcome are all 100% Jane's fault.

&amp;nbsp;

While I don't know if a pregnancy being ""paused"" is possible, I will note that [fetus in fetu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus_in_fetu) and [parasitic twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_twin) arguably provide something similar.

&gt; A fetus in fetu can be considered alive, but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated. Thus, the life of a fetus in fetu is akin to that of a tumor in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity.

The best example being the case of [Sanju Bhagat](https://mysteriousfacts.com/pregnant-man-sanju-bhagat/), a man who looked pregnant at age 36, and had his mutated twin living inside him. I'm curious how different the outcome would've been had he been a woman.

&amp;nbsp;

The purpose of this thought experiment? To force anti-choicers into a dilemma where they have to acknowledge the . ""That's not possible"" isn't a valid argument either, because first of all, this is a thought experiment, and second of all, fetus in fetu makes it relevant regardless.

Hey what are some of the most outrageous arguments or opinion you heard from pro-lifer/ anti abortion people,"here are the 2 I heard 

1. It'f fine for a women to commit suicide but if she pregnant, she should be force to wait until the baby is no longer apart of her before she can end her life 
2. If a women was on a substance prior to being pregnant, once she become pregnant she need stop taking said substance until after she give birth ( This one is for those women that are taking medication that could be harmful to the fetus for like mental health or something but I guess this also applies to thing like drugs and alcohol)",t2_4peg9a81,1637121537,prochoice
I think ALL WOMEN need to get REPARATIONS from the government,"Historically, the world over and in this country (USA) women have ALWAYS had LESS OPPORTUNITIES and money than men and EVERY TIME there is a presidential election we are in danger of losing our basic human rights to privacy and bodily autonomy. Perhaps what our Pro-Choice movement needs to do as a counter-strike to the anti-choice movement is to not only SOLIDIFY a woman’s right to CHOOSE to opt-out of parenthood by enshrining her constitutional rights in a way that those rights can NEVER be taken away, but also SUE THEM for all the damages done against women over the decades or centuries in this country. I’m sick of the double standard,  Men don’t seem to have a problem securing their rights to privacy and bodily autonomy but women, well, they don’t even treat us like humans and that’s disgraceful so I think we (ALL WOMEN) also need to be DEMANDING REPARATIONS from the government in the form of PERMANENT MONTHLY MONETARY PAYMENTS. They (the government)  owe us (WOMEN) our human rights and MONETARY PAYMENT for the years and lifetimes we (and our mothers and grandmothers etc) were denied their basic rights and made SLAVES and for ALL THE DAMAGES and DEATHS  (physical, psychological,mental, social and economic) that this misogynistic patriarchal has affiliated upon women. We want our human rights guaranteed and these MEN in power (government) need to pay us (ALL WOMEN) for all the damage they have done to women. This would make an EXCELLENT CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT. Maybe if we collectively did THIS, they might think twice or stop trying to take away our rights.",t2_7r0fnsh8,1637116327,prochoice
"Yo pro-lifers, if you want fewer abortions, then encourage effective use of contraceptives in all ages.","Abstinence-only sex education has probably led to an increase in abortions. The idea is that if teenagers learn about how to have safe sex, then they will have sex. Lean in close a moment, I'm going to let you in on a big secret: *Teenagers are having sex already.* Shhh, make sure not to tell anyone that, okay?

Gonna go on a bit of a tangent here. A kid costs about $250,000 total, up to age 18, which would make every little bit of extra money and effort worth it. Literally everyone would benefit if contraceptives were encouraged, widely accepted, free, and discreetly available. Currently if a teen wants to get a contraceptive, there are a series of barriers:

* Knowing that such a thing exists.
* Knowing that such a thing is very necessary.
* Knowing that such a thing will not get them in trouble.
* Knowing that such a thing is available to them.
* Knowing that such a thing will not require announcing their intentions in any way (i.e. asking their parents).

Optimally, each teen should be given a few condoms each just baseline (even the girls), so that everyone knows that everyone else has condoms, and there is no reason to hide them or be embarrassed of them (except in front of people at home if they are anti-contraceptive and/or don't know about the condoms being handed out). Then also put up dispensers for condoms and pregnancy tests all over the schools, and in pharmacies and such as well. Eventually they straight-up become desensitized and will not feel weird getting more. And one can always tell a stupid lie and tell other kids they are getting condoms to use as water balloons or something. 

&amp;nbsp;

Day-after pills are like $15-20 each, which may make handing them out like candy extremely costly, but at bare minimum they should be available for free from the school nurse.

Every dumbass teen in the school is required to prove, through *regular* tests at bare minimum (to cement the knowledge in their memory), that they are aware of the contraceptives available to them and how to make use of them. Throw in how to properly do pull-out, because they're probably going to do it anyway.",t2_j4fyl,1637090323,prochoice
"I feel that the views towards abortion should be based on the natural phenomenon of miscarriages, which have a rate of 30-40%.","Rates of miscarriages, known medically as ""spontaneous abortions"", vary immensely based on a wide range of risk factors, but generally it is 10-20% among women who know they are pregnant, and 30-40% overall.^[\[1\]](https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) Essentially, the human body expelling fertilized eggs is a relatively normal, very natural phenomenon. This eliminates a lot of religious arguments against abortion. 

Somewhat related, pregnant female mice tend to have miscarriages after spending time around an unfamiliar male, which they make use of, by purposefully seeking out new males, if they think they can find a better mate.^[\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660991/) Nature as a whole clearly doesn't care.

Around 50% of miscarriages are caused by some form of chromosomal abnormality.^[\[1\]](https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) In other words, the human body does not like to give birth to children that will have a low chance of success in life.

&amp;nbsp;

**Beginning sarcasm**

If abortion were to be truly considered ""murder"", then miscarriage should be considered ""accidental murder"". There is an extensive list of miscarriage risks, many of which can be controlled, and otherwise could be made aware of.^[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_risks) In which case, miscarriage should be classified as ""negligent homicide"" or ""involuntary manslaughter"", as there is always something the woman could have done better. 

Each woman has a responsibility to either maintain perfect health, or not get pregnant, to save countless lives. Orwellian levels of scrutiny are required. If a woman with risks becomes pregnant and has a miscarriage, then regardless of circumstances or knowledge of said risks, she obviously didn't try hard enough to prevent the loss of a human life.

Age is one of the biggest risk factors behind miscarriage, so every woman should be sterilized once they hit a certain age.

**Ending sarcasm**

I was going to say that this is a bit of slippery slope fallacy, but women have actually been arrested for ""engaging in behaviors that could put a pregnancy at risk"".^[\[4\]](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-advocates-arizona/blog/when-miscarriage-is-a-crime) Of course, these are all because of ""fetus personhood"" laws, that dehumanize pregnant women. Then there are the areas of the world where a miscarriage can result in getting stoned to death. 

I'm making the point about how anti-choice oppresses women and leads to grief from miscarriages. Miscarriages used to result in relief, and were considered a blessing in disguise.^[\[5\]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178514) Magazines and articles went from showing pictures of the healthy babies that would come later, to showing pictures of empty cribs and grieving mothers.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR - Miscarriage is perfectly normal, and potentially even *healthy*. If your body can do it naturally, then it should also be a choice.**

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1636966818,prochoice

prolifers make me rage,"i had an abortion last year, I was reaching out on the abortion subreddit to ask people what the whole process is like, and for some help as well, that was on a different account and I haven't been on that account in about a year, recently I logged back into it and I noticed I had some dm's from prolifers, one of them flat out saying they hope I die for ""killing that babe"" and another trying to guilt trip me telling me that I have ""precious life living inside me"" and I ended up reacting to them cause I found them aggrevating, today one of them replied saying that I want the rights to kill a child and holy shit did it set me off, I let all my rage out on that guy and I don't feel guilty for it. I honestly don't know what makes pro lifers think they're so entitled to other people's bodies, and why they feel so entitled to saving the ""life"" of a child that isn't even theirs in the first place ?? I don't get that at all. And if you try to argue with them they try and lecture you with facts about abortion and ""science"" which I'm not even sure they're 100% true and when you make a valid point they just say ""oh so murder is okay"" like fml why do they dramaticise abortion so much to say that it's murder, when it's not murder it's just ending a pregnancy. I'll never understand but I don't think anyone should be forced to carry out a pregnancy to full term, forcing that to happen will have so much more of an effect on the pregnant person rather than the fetus. How do pro lifers sympathise with something that can't even comprehend its own existence but can't stand it when a pregnant person wants control over their own body. Why are they so entitled.

When you can look at the stats and see that most prolifers (in the us) are christian and most atheists are pro choice. Looking at a blob of tissue with all the sentience of a carrot and assigning it the same value (or let’s me real here, more value) as a thinking, feeling woman just *reeks* of magical thinking.

A man's perspective on why I'm militantly pro-choice,"1. It's her body

2. It's her body!

3. (And I can't stress this enough) **IT'S HER BODY!**

4. If people don't want abortions they don't have to get one, and if they don't want anyone to have abortions well let's actually address the root cause for abortions: unwanted pregnancies. So provide comprehensive sex education from a young age, and make contraceptives free/extremely cheap! 

Whenever I look at anti abortion people, its painfully obvious they are not ""pro life"" but instead ""pro forced birth"" and ""anti women"" and frankly I hate that. 

""Oh but doesn't a man get a say?"" They ask. Yes, he gets to *say* his opinion but it's still her body, and her choice in my eyes. ""If he wants it but she doesn't, he doesn't have a say, but if she wants it and he doesn't, he doesn't have a say!"" Yeah, and that's a problem. He should be able to waive complete and total parental rights if he so chooses but he shouldn't get to dictate her individual choice.",t2_enph7823,1636747314,prochoice

I cannot understand prolifers that don't even make rape abortions an exception,"I really can't. Let's suppose you stabbed someone. Analogous to pro life logic, we will say conceiving a fetus is the stabbed victim. They say the stabber, ie the person carrying the fetus, must repay the crime in blood, ie keep the stabbed person alive by repay their blood bit by bit. Let's say I agree to that. 

Now another scenario, a man stabbed me and my friend. we are both unconscious but my friend has lost a lot of blood. The doctors transfer blood from me to my friend. (Unethical, but let's just say that happens) but then, a minute later a wake up and say 'wtf. I don't wanna donate my blood, if I do I could faint, and I could be the one dying'. I pull the plug, my friend dies. its sad, but how am I the moral monster? 

Its the same with rape victims. Yes, even if the fetus is a person, even if I see it that way, it sucks. But why should a pregnant person keep the fetus alive against their will. We've established the rape victim didn't ask for it. 

The proliferd just keep saying how the fetus is a victim and shouldnt be murdered. like OK? And the rape victim is a victim and should be subject to slavery.",t2_mztn6r8,1636695736,prochoice

Dismantling one pro-life argument all at once.,"I am of course talking about the statement that, ""since the future baby is alive at conception, it's immoral to terminate it.

This statement in itself is flawed because not only is the future child alive at birth...it's technically alive before birth. I am talking about, you guessed it...sperm! Sperm are alive way before the conception processes is even thought of. So if you agree to ban abortion merely because it's ""living"" (on a technicality) then you must also ban male masterbation because it kills sperm (and as me know sperm are alive) and you must also ban the chopping down of trees because it kills a living thing. You also must ban the killing of... basically ever living thing pest or no because it is a ""living thing""...

"Pro life and pro choice may not agree on much, but one thing the two side can agree on is sex education and unfettered access to birth control is an absolute must.","While the two sides are opposed on the subject of abortion, proper sexual education and unfettered access to *all* types of birth control will prevent the need for abortion in the first place. A very small percentage of the pro life crowd are able to understand this, but too many simply refuse to even acknowledge that sex outside of marriage and for non-procreation should exists. They preach absitnence only, which we *all know* does not work and only increases cases of unplanned or unwanted pregnancies. 

No one wants to have an abortion. Its traumatic. In an ideal world, the debate wouldnt need to exist because only people who want a baby would get pregnant.

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1636362011,prochoice
"Hey guys, I got into a debate and was wondering how could I have responded better ?","Hey guys so I got into an argument over abortion in the comment section of a pro-life video about 14 hours ago and I wanted to get your advice on what I could have done better, now I won't be posting all of the argument cause I feel like I done good in some point, I will be sharing the point where I thought I could have done better or parts where I didn't have a clear response and needed to figure out something on the fly. 

I will be breaking it down into 3 section, 1. my opponents argument 2. My response 3. the background to some of the argument use cause I feel like context is necessary. also number 8 I feel like I could have done better but I didn't know how to worded my response right   

Argument 

1. If the constitution didn't recognize a right to live for humans up to the age of 3 years old, would that make it morally permissible to kill them and therefore should state law permit the killing of these humans?  No.  So the constitutions silence about abortion does not mean abortion should be legal.
2. Govt is obligated to protect basic human rights, so no it's not morally permissible for the govt to permit the killing of 3 year olds. 
3. The zygote is on auto-pilot.  Anything the zygote does was caused by that human's biological parents.  So, you can't blame the zygote for doing what the parents caused it to do. 
4.  Any human that the law does not recognize as a person is discrimination.  I oppose this discrimination because all humans should be treated equally regarding basic human rights. 
5. . Mental illness and heat of the moment situations are mitigating circumstances, but they still have a will and still choose to do the criminal act.  A zygote is completely on auto-pilot, not merely influenced by emotion, etc. 
6.  The unborn are discriminated against when we don't treat them as persons under the law the same way we treat all other humans. 
7. If there are other places where basic human rights are not respected, that should be fixed.  We shouldn't excuse a violation of human rights in one area because there is a violation of human rights in another area. 
8. Protecting unborn humans from abortion does not take away a woman's equal basic human rights.  First, half of the unborn who are aborted are female, so killing girls in the name of women's rights makes no sense.  Second, if a woman transitions to a man and then becomes pregnant, the prohibition on abortion would apply to that man.  Third, if it were possible for a biological man to become pregnant, the law would still apply to him. The fact that it's not possible doesn't mean the law is unequal.

My Response 

1.  if the constitutions didn't recognize the life to live for a human up to the age of 3 would that make it morally permissible to kill them and should the state allow it to happened ? well I believe that morality is subjective for 1. so rather it's morally accepted is kinda irreverent, now should it be legal ? my answer is yes it should be, if the constitutions is not against it then there is no reason for us to be.
2. I did some quick research into what the job of a gov is and this is the first search result.' A government is responsible for creating and enforcing the rules of a society, defense, foreign affairs, the economy, and public services.
3. so going by that logic we should out right ban abortion in all cases even in situation where the mother life would be in danger. also going by that logic, we shouldn't punish people who commit crime in the heat of the moment or because of mental illness, situation where a person is on auto-pilot and can't really control there action  
4. if the human in question is zygote, embryo and fetus then can you tell me how they are being discriminated against ? also not all human are deserving of human right, according to america anyway and a lot of place around the world. we still allow slavery in our prison system. also the fact that abortion would take away a women human right to equality, since she would be prevented to having control over her reproduction choices unlike her male counter part 
5. mental illness is something that a person usually can't control and are effectively on auto-pilot. also don't change the fact that they commit a crime same thing for zygote they put themselves in the womb in the first place auto-pilot or not the mother didn't physical attach them to her womb. they did it to themselves so it how they got in the mother body is irreverent. just like what trigger the event  of the mentally ill or the heat of passion case is also irreverent. 
6.  most law in america have a cut off point, that is after viability before then a women is allow to abort because it's not viable  so it don't matter seem fair to me. also just because we allow abortion don't mean that we are discriminated against them anymore or less. we allow born human to be kill under the right circumstance and we allow the unborn to be kill, seem even to me  
7. maybe so but until they fix those human rights violation, ill still use it to argue my position and also alot of people are fine with some of those human rights violation. 
8. taking away a women right to chose do violate her equality. as a men we are able to chose who we reproduce with during the 9 months a women is pregnant and decide what happens to our bodies, taking away abortion will take away her ability to decide what will happen to her body during that 9 months where she is force to carry a child she may not want, it also take away her ability to chose who she will be able to reproduce with. also we both know that if biological men can get pregnant, no way they would willingly limit abortion. also the right we are talking about is the right to bodily autonomy and privacy so the gender of the fetus killed is kinda irrelevant especially if the fetus killed is male which is the other half, so going by your logic the fetus that are male are bring killed for women right which cancel out the female fetus that are being killed sine they are the other half

The Background, I feel like for number 3 you will need some background info to why we are discussing  zygote being on auto-pilot, so here is that background

*  the unborn human is inside the woman's body because she engaged in a sexual act that (1) created the human and (2) put the vulnerable human inside her body in a dependent state.  A right to one's body is not a right to create and kill a human. 
* while we could argue who is at fault for the fetus being in the women body in general. I like to argue that you can't blame the women for the fetus being in her womb. why you might be asking ! because of how biology work, its kinda hard to get pregnant even if you was trying to. once the zygote is made it will have to travel through the women body to try to attach itself onto the wall of the uterus and if it fails then the women body will shed it from it's body. the zygote is clearly trying to enter the women womb on it's own so it's the zygote fault for being in the womb.  if you are against that then here some food for thought. I believe that if we ban abortion then any  and all women who have a miscarriage should be thrown in prison for manslaughter. using your logic she put that baby in her and force it in her body so it was her responsibility to take care of it",t2_4peg9a81,1636350671,prochoice

Today , I got the positive test. 

Im in Texas and im terrified . I’ve had the procedure at PP and I’ve been booed in the car on my way out . 

So when I heard the abortion ban in Texas I bought the home pills to take in the event I had another unplanned pregnancy .


Im so traumatized from my abortions and my last pregnancy . 
We’ve done well for ourselves and our children . So we’re all set , it isn’t the financial burden it’s the fact I need almost as much care as my children . We’re all ADHD and/or autistic . So it’s not a viable option to add on . Im so heartbroken . I’ve begged my husband to get a vasectomy . Maybe this will be the push he needs . Because I’m scared .

"Rebuttal to ""My body, my choice? Why bodily autonomy doesn't justify abortion"""," A user shared this a few days ago which I had to remove due to it lacking a sufficient explanation of what the prolife article entailed.

I was, however, intrigued by the article and decided to write a rebuttal to it. I will note that I wrote this rebuttal as I read it and I wrote it hastily (still took me an hour and a half...) so please forgive anything that is written gruffly or misspelled.

 https://www.mccl.org/post/2016/12/19/my-body-my-choice-why-bodily-autonomy-doesnt-justify-abortion

&gt;Some people think that the unborn (the human embryo or fetus) is a mere part of the woman's body. But science, of course, has established that the unborn—though physically dependent on and inside of the mother—is a distinct, self-developing individual with his or her own DNA, brain, arms and legs, etc.

Science has determined that an embryo is a new organism. This does not, however, confer that it is a separate individual.

Embryos are homeostatically intertwined with the human organism that is the pregnant person. They are metabolically, immunologically, topologically, and functionally a part of another person's body. I wrote about this [here](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4445014195365707507/3629490349759282271#).

I applaud that there is a lack of erasure here (as is evident in so many prolifers rhetoric) however, there is still a dismissal of the role of gestation by referring to the biological realities as mere dependency and locale.

There is zero attempt to acknowledge the biological differences between born and unborn humans. If done in the setting of, say, elder care, this would be akin to making zero differentiation between a caregiver changing a catheter bag and giving them their kidney. Giving someone the abilities of your bodily functions would be seen as a requirement no different than helping them to the bathroom. It is self evident that there are differentiations.

This also covers up the fact that humans are unique in the human rights they have due to their sentience. And by this I mean there is ignoring of the concept of personhood. It presupposes that human organism and personhood are synonymous without defending that. If we ignore these factors, there argument seems plausible, especially to those not versed in this debate. Because of this, prolifers are able to get people on board with their ideology from arguing from a position of authority rather than on the merits of their arguments. This type of false presentation is rampant in anti-abortion politics, as well as religion and politics. If one is to argue for the removal of the human rights of half of the world's population, or to argue for their reconfiguration that requires dismissal of the very bodily process they likewise argue as being vital to an embryo, one should at least understand what is going on in pregnancy.

&gt;Abortion attacks and kills the body of someone else.

So does killing in self defense. There is pretext included in this statement, which I am sure will arise throughout the remainder of this person's essay. For now, I will note that pregnancy uses the body of someone else. And abortion bans mean this is done non-consensually. 

&gt;Trent Horn helpfully distinguishes between two variations of this approach.\[1\] The first version, which he calls the ""Sovereign Zone"" argument, claims that a woman has an absolute right to do whatever she wants with anything that is inside her body. And the unborn child—even if she is a human person—is currently within that sovereign zone.  
But sovereignty cannot be absolute. 

So let's pause at this last statement. He has made a statement that basically says ""there are times where the use of one's body can be acceptable.""

&gt;Consider an analogy: May we do whatever we want with anything that is on our private property? May we attack or kill innocent people who are passing through or seeking refuge? No, we must respect the rights of other people. ""Mere ownership,"" acknowledges pro-choice philosopher Mary Anne Warren, ""does not give me the right to kill innocent people whom I find on my property.""\[2\] And so it is with pregnancy.

He has analogized our bodies to inanimate objects. He disregards our biological realities. He disregards our humanity. He argues that an embryo is biologically alive and distinct and then tosses that concept aside and equates our bodies with inorganic property. This attempt is how prolifers slowly erode intuitive understandings people have  about human bodies vs inanimate objects. This argument makes our bodies something to be ""owned"" in the sense that a slave master owns a person.

So on the one hand, he argues that the human body that is an embryo is a precious human life. But when it comes to the human body that is that of the woman, he argues that it is mere property.

If we are going to be at all consistent, if we our bodies are mere property, mere inanimate objects, then the embryo is also property and and merely an inanimate object. He inadvertently argues that human bodies can be owned and viewed as property, not realizing that, if we all have equal human rights, an embryo can likewise be owned and viewed as property. And thus, if we are equated with houses, embryos must be equated with the furnishings within that house. And no one should have an issue with throwing out a chair from a house. 

Deceptive framing like this makes the prolife ideology gain ground in the minds of unsuspecting individuals. Sounds reasonable but requires the dehumanization of females and pregnant people.

&gt;May a pregnant woman ingest drugs that she knows will cause her child to be deformed or disabled? Clearly not.\[3\] And if knowingly harming the child is wrong, *killing* her (through abortion) is even worse. Bodily autonomy is important, but there are obvious limits to that autonomy when someone else's body is also involved.

She actually may. There isn't a law outlawing a pregnant person from ingesting a specific type of drug. There are regulations on certain drugs that may be consumed by pregnant people, but this is different from that of it being unlawful and mirrors other laws regulating the ingestion of other drugs by people with certain other conditions. Meaning that unless a doctor prescribes you a medication that they feel a person with that condition can ingest safely, your taking that drug would be unlawful. It would be taking a substance you were not prescribed. 

&gt;This argument has enormous problems. Abortion, in the vast majority of cases,\[5\] is not merely the withholding or withdrawing of ""life support"" from the unborn child—it is the intentional and active killing of that child, often by dismemberment. This killing violates the child's right to life (the right not to be intentionally killed) and right to bodily integrity. Indeed, ""if people have a right to bodily integrity and so do not have a duty to donate a kidney,"" writes philosopher Christopher Kaczor, ""then people *in utero* have a right not to have their bodily integrity fatally violated through abortion.""\[6\]

First, let's address this ""right to not be killed"" part. This isn't a right that exists because prolifers consistently leave off and just assume the additional part of that statement: ""the right to not be killed *unjustly.*"" 

They leave this part off because they have already drawn the conclusion in which they are being required to defend and don't want to have to defend it: that an embryo is being killed unjustly.

But we need to back up here. Because they have already gone too far in this analogy and it obfuscates certain realities. It walks past an essential question: are other people entitled to your body? The answer to that is no. But he, like many prolifers, want to make an exception for that for embryos and they try to persuade you by looking at the manner in which *an already pregnant person* must use in order to exercise their human right.

We couldn't forcibly implant embryos created from IVF into a person's body. If embryos were conceived outside the human uterus, you would need permission to place them inside of that person's body. 

That a pregnant person was unable to adequately control their bodily processes of ovulation and pregnancy initiated from the embryo implanting themselves, that they were unable to adequately prevent the initial use of their body, does not therefore entitled the embryo to remain being gestated. 

This is what I mean by having gone too far. Since I have the right to deny initial use, that the use has already begun now requires their removal which results in the death of the embryo, and can even include it's direct killing. However, this factor is where the ""just"" part is satisfied. 

If abortion requires dismemberment, that is because that is the method in which is needed in order to restore the pregnant person's previous state in which they are entitled to due to the fact that no one is entitled to another person's body.

Prolifers ignore this factor which further obfuscates and erode intuitive understandings in order to defend their conclusion.

Now, let's look at the 2nd part of that paragraph in regards to the bodily integrity of the embryo. Again, we have gone too far when examining this. We absolutely can give an embryo a right to bodily integrity. Let's look at this in two parts.

First, in examining bodily integrity in being synonymous with bodily autonomy: embryos do not have autonomy. They are attached to and hooked into the body of another human organism. 

Second, in examining it as a stand alone ""bodily integrity"" issue, I would offer that medical abortion (as in abortions induced through pills that are essentially miscarriages) do nothing to the bodily integrity of the embryo. 

Contrast that with the medication that is used to treat ectopic pregnancies. Medication used typically to treat cancer is used on those types of pregnancies to end them. (Cancer occurs due to a corruption of the dna that embryos use to achieve their rapid growth rate.) This medication actually *does* act directly on the embryonic body to inhibit and stop growth. Medical abortion acts solely on the pregnant person's body and severes the connection to their body. (You don't get to tell me that a person doesn't have the right to shield *their* body from what you wish to do to it.)

So, seeing as how medical abortion is not direct killing in the same manner is ending ectopic pregnancies or surgical abortions are, I therefore raise the question as to why there would be an objection to surgical abortions where dismemberment or vacuuming would be required. 

The embryo will surely die if done through medical abortion. And I have established above how this is within that person's right. If we know that the embryo will surely die, we have a duty to use the least harmful abortion method on the woman. We wouldn't cut her open and remove the embryo via c-section in order to preserve the bodily integrity of an embryo that will die. (Although there have been ridiculous Catholic arguments for removing the fallopian tube in cases of ectopic pregnancies and that death via this double effect is somehow acceptable.)

So again, I posit, that we have gone too far in our outrage over different methods of abortion.

And it is here that I will posit that prolifers likewise have no issue with this substantiation of previous facts in that they have historically justified their position of anti-abortion through blaming and shaming of those who have consensual sex. They justify their position on this initial factor. So they are no stranger to analyzing previous factors. But they are also not strangers to cherry picking either.

&gt;Moreover, even if abortion were not intentional killing (i.e., if it were simply a refusal to aid the child by removing her from the womb), abortion would still be wrong because a pregnant woman *does* have an obligation to allow her baby to live and grow in the womb. Here's why.

I am interested in seeing his explanation why.

&gt;First, the father and mother, except in cases of rape, willingly engaged in an activity that caused (and is biologically ordered to) the creation of a new, dependent human being. So they bear responsibility for the resulting child.

Oh, lookit that. I was just talking about the substantiation for their anti abortion position being rooted in the ""well she had sex"" argument.

So, correct, they willing engaged in sex. The conclusion that therefore, she isn't allowed to have an abortion doesn't follow from that knowledge.

And it's right there in that same sentence as to why: rape. Pregnancy resulting from rape tells us that pregnancy happens regardless of if we consented to sex or not. In fact, it tells us that sex doesn't lead to pregnancy, but rather that insemination does. Or rather, insemination *can* result in pregnancy. So why would we hold consensual sex as some sort of conference that pregnancy was consented to?

In fact, that the person is seeking abortion means that they explicitly *do not* consent to the pregnancy aspect. 

That pregnancy is an outcome of sex and therefore should be made to play out through legal restrictions is folly for another factor: the reverse of that could be argued. Meaning that since non-pregnancy often results after having sex and therefore should be made to play out through legal restrictions. His reasoning can be used against him and can be used to justify *forced abortions*. 

 And as for ""bearing responsibility for the resulting child,"" I will point out that an embryo is A) developing *into* a child and B) it doesn't lend to the conclusion that that would require mandatory gestation. This goes back to the question of: are other people entitled to your body? A woman and pregnant person's human rights are not dependent on the needs or SLED of another human. That an embryo is desperately in need of the gestating womb it is in does not take away that person's human rights to be sovereign over their own body. 

I also like his use of the term ""ordered"" towards. While we are on the topic of being ordered towards something, I will refer back to my blog entry and the section on ""Level of Organization"" about how the human species is ordered towards a specific level of organization. And this includes embryos - they have a need for a fully formed human body, that is why they must be attached to the body of such a human. They are not exempt from this fact. 

&gt;Second, parents have special obligations to their dependent offspring that they do not have to others. Fathers, for example, must pay child support even if they did not intend or desire to become fathers. Parents may not abandon their children or refuse to provide for their needs (though they may relinquish those obligations through adoption).

It is dishonest to conflating a parental obligation to pay child support with a biological forced used of one's body. It's as dishonest as saying ""your job duty entails that you as a caregiver must change out a catheter bag, therefore, you should also have to give your kidney."" 

It should just simply be rejected at hand. 

And, in fact, the sexism here is evident because he refers to fathers having to pay child support which just simply isn't true. Mothers pay child support as well - **it is a parental rights issue, not a bodily rights issue.**

Further, he is conflating a biological parentage obligation with a sociological parentage obligation. Sociologically, we do typically require parents to meet certain obligations. None of those, however, have ever included giving parts of your body and biological processes to your child. This is evident in that you need signed consent from a mother who has just given birth to even give their child a blood transfusion. Or to give their child their kidney or liver. Prolifers want to bypass this requirement and just have a law that signs for them.

If we want to look at the biological parentage approach for obligations and duties and rights, well we need to take into consideration other aspects such as how animals in the wild frequently abandon their young without any interference from 3rd parties of that species. Something tells me the author of this blog whole heartedly rejects that idea. 

&gt;Indeed, more generally, ""we are by nature members of communities,"" explains ethicist Patrick Lee. ""\[O\]ur flourishing involves being in communion with others. And communion with others of itself—even if we find ourselves united with others because of a physical or social relationship which precedes our consent—entails duties or responsibilities.""\[7\]

And yet prolifers frequently argue for why they shouldn't have to help in any other aspect of meeting mom's needs so that she may willfully continue her pregnancy. Mom says she can't afford it and the same political party that holds the prolife ideology refuses to provide a living wage, medical insurance, cover childcare costs, paid medical leave. They cut food stamps and demonize them as ""welfare queens."" And this list is not exhaustive; the Republican party continually pushes women out of this same community in which they speak. Some of them will offer that their are churches and pregnancy centers that can offer resources, but these typically can't even meet the bare minimum and they come rife with religious strings attached. 

&gt;Parental obligation may not require extraordinary acts (like donating a kidney), but it does require basic, ordinary care, such as the nourishment and shelter provided during pregnancy.\[8\] If unborn children are valuable members of the human family, like born children, then the same parental duties that apply after birth are present beforehand as well.

Here, once again, is the belittling of pregnancy from the standing of the pregnant person. Pregnancy is seen as an ordinary act. It's as mundane and insignificant as wiping your child's ass. 

Yet when a person says they want an abortion, suddenly it's significance is invaluable.

This very paragraph, that belittles the invaluable significance the pregnant person plays in gestating, then goes on to highlight the value of embryos as members of the human species.  

Women and pregnant people are exploited and treated as second class citizens.

Additionally, in law, the definition of extraordinary acts vs ordinary acts do not lend to pregnancy being an ordinary act.

But again, this person is trying to blur the lines between a human in utero vs a born human. They are trying to show how the use of a person's body is the same as using someone's property while arguing that humans in utero in invaluable and should not be treated as mere property one holds within them.

&gt;Third, the purpose of the uterus is to gestate the unborn child—it is where that child *belongs*. All human beings, during their prenatal stages of development, rely on it for care and protection. ""The uterus exists for the unborn child rather than for the mother,"" notes Stephanie Gray.\[9\] It is reasonable to think that a child has a right to live in her natural environment.\[10\]

I've already previously written a rebuttal to this in another blog entry [here](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4445014195365707507/3629490349759282271#). 

&gt;Finally, even apart from the other reasons, a moral obligation seems to arise when we alone are in a position to provide ordinary care (food and shelter) to someone who needs it to survive.\[11\] 

Again, you are not providing mere ordinary care. You are not just giving them food and shelter. You are carrying out all biological processes for this other organism. You are maintaining their homeostasis and are providing metabolic functions such as respiration and waste removal. See first linked blog entry for more details.

&gt;""Suppose you live in a cabin far out in the wilderness, cut off from civilization by extreme distance and weather for much of the year, say, nine months,"" writes Mathew Lu, a philosophy professor at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. ""One day you return to the cabin to discover that an infant has been left at the door without explanation. … Do you have an obligation to care for the infant, who will surely die if you do not take it in?""\[12\]

Someone who does not live as a part of a society should not be held to that society's standards.

However, providing basic care for this infant would not include what is including in gestation and it is reasonable to expect that the person provide basic things like food to an infant.

&gt;Most people would say yes. ""\[W\]e have a general obligation to protect the vulnerable, and a special obligation towards those we contingently encounter,"" Lu concludes.\[13\]

And yet you argue for not protecting vulnerable pregnant people. In fact, you demonize them and liken to treating them as criminals for having the audacity to use body parts you ear mark as being meant for other's use. 

&gt;""The so-called right to abortion has … sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships,"" observed Mother Teresa of Calcutta. ""It has portrayed the greatest of gifts—a child—as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters.""\[14\] This ""unconscionable power,"" Mother Teresa said, must be rejected. Both mother and child deserve respect, protection, and care.

 It takes a ""gift"" and forces it onto an unwilling person. A gift that is forced is not a gift. And when it is forced from such an intimate human relationship, it becomes a form of violence; one of the most egregious kinds there is: sexual violence. 

Our bodies are not conveniences. This is yet another attempt to belittle pregnant people and treat their bodies as property to be owned and used like a house. ",t2_6gi7y,1636230254,prochoice

14 times higher than the mortality rate associated

 The mortality rate is 0.35 deaths

Is a fetus technically speaking not a human ?,"so I am looking at the definition of what a human is and most of the definition say that a there are characteristic which define human 

Here is the noun definition of human from google

1. a human being, especially a person as distinguished from an animal or (in science fiction) an alien.

here is a biology definition 

1. A **human** is a [*bipedal*](https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/bipedal) *hominin* characterized by having a higher and vertical forehead compared with earlier hominins. The brain volume is about 1,400 cc. The teeth and jaw are smaller and the chin is prominent. Humans are the hominins capable of creating and using complex tools, solving problems by sense and reasoning, using symbols and language, and creating complex social structures. Over time, humans have demonstrated behavioral modernity and advancement. 

there are other definition but they more or less say the same thing. It seem like a human is a member of the ape family that can be identify by having human traits. what do you guys think, am I just trying to force this or do you think this can be something ?",t2_4peg9a81,1635996861,prochoice

It’s not like I’m calling anyone a slur.

Can you give me your opinion about this reasoning... Can it be valid?,"So i'm an anti natalist and i was thinking about something... That's a shower thought so it's not completely formulated already.

So i was thinking about the topic prolifer use in their rhetoric ""sex is for procreation"" so any time a woman and a man give permission to sex they are automatically giving permission to impregnation and procreation. 
And at some point it pops in my mind, children don't give their permission to their parents to be bought into this world.

Is it correct to use something along the line ""people don't give permission to procreation automatically with the act of sex, it's the same as saying that a child that is born gave permission to his/her parents to be crated. No children ever gave permission to their parents, in the same way a person that decide to give permission to sex isn't giving permission to an action they have no control over it."" so it follows"" a new born has no control over permission and a person that choose to have sex doesn't give consent to impregnation because we don't really have control over it, expecially if the person used contraception but it failed, the person clearly gave consent over something he/she didn't had any control.""

Why," The assumption that life is superceded by the convenience of the people involved. First of all, the claim that there are few people waiting for adoption is false, there are currently 34 couples waiting to adopt for every child put up for adoption. Quality of life should not result in someone being killed. You should not kill someone because you believe their life will be bad. Their life is their decision and their responsibility. While rape is tragic, and the rapist should be rightfully punished, it does not supercede a humans right to life. We did not choose to be born, yet we were and are now able to make decisions that affect our lives for ourselves.(btw there were less that 1 million cases of rape in the us in 2019, which while horrible is not close to the millions proposed.) Ultimately the life is not for us who are already here to decide.",t2_dzc0jzwy,1635764527,prochoice

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1635753612,prochoice

Feeling uneasy.,"I am 26 years old &amp; 5 weeks pregnant. The Father is 57 years old. We’ve known each other for two years. He has 5 adult children by 4 different women. For many reasons I am considering terminating the pregnancy. Not knowing how to explain it to friends &amp; family &amp; of course how society will view me. The mortality of the father, along with still trying to build my life &amp; career. He is not the best person to raise a child with, emotionally unavailable, harsh.. so on &amp; so forth. He doesn’t have good relationships with his children &amp; claims that they are “disappointments”. Maybe he just isn’t that great of a Father. I want my kid to be wanted &amp; loved by us both. 

He is fully supportive in whatever decision I want to make. Keeping it, I would live with him &amp; we would raise the child together. Not sure how much help he would be other than financial. Even after telling him, his energy has been off to me. He’s mentioned “giving me a baby” so many times before but now seems to not care &amp; is leaving all the decisions up to me. 

I have always seen myself marrying someone else &amp; starting a family. I am terrified in making the wrong decision. I had two miscarriages in the past &amp; was worried about if I’ll ever have a child. 

I take full responsibility but I know this is terrible timing &amp; I want my child to be raised in a two parent household as I was. I understand that many women have a child or children &amp; eventually find the love of their lives &amp; build even bigger families, I’m just worried about what affect the relationship dynamic of the father &amp; I would have on our child.

I gave my man the benefit of the doubt and I think I was wrong,"So I(21F )was arguing with my bf (20M)and we got the point where I told him that I’ll resent him if he ever makes me bear a kid and he started saying he doesn’t give a fuck if I abort it. Saying it is a sin in his religion but he doesn’t care since I’m an atheist and I’m the one doing the abortion. I thought well still I’ll get to abort if I get pregnant. After that we got to the point wether the guy has a say in it or not. 
So his reasons for the guy having 50% say in keeping or aborting the baby were:
1. It is his child in the woman’s body 
2. He will have to support her through pregnancy and after that pay for child support 
And then added the dad goes through mental damage during the pregnancy and that dads also commit suicide when they get unwanted child which I never said those problems don’t exist. I mentioned to him about the risks the woman has to carry just by keeping the baby which were:
1.permanent physical change and health affects 
2.mental damage of carrying the baby when she didn’t want to and the life losing risk of giving birth.
Which he replied to me with physical damages can be healed and that she can give the kid to the baby and focus on healing her mental and physical damage.
And after that he accuses me of saying I’m blaming everything on guys about the pregnancy which I didn’t . He would exclude the mental damage factor if the women and only focuses only the physical damages being temporary and how she’ll get support from the dad. 
How I see it is it is her body so he doesn’t have a say in it. He can say he either wants the baby or not but it should be up to her to decide since she’ll have to carry it, bear it and go through a lot of change with her body and mind during that. And also mentioned she is not some cow he has to sell beef that he can force her to bear it. And told him the 50-50 is a total crap. By giving the guy 50% he can make her not abort since it’s by nowhere near a choice.
Maybe I got too far but I got so angry about it. I was so frustrated by how he sees it. Thinking he can have a final say to the decision of the women’s body. After that he got sarcastic saying I’m right and changed the topic. 
Maybe I went too far in the argument but I’m glad I did. Now I’m sure I want no strings left between him and me. Gonna leave him soon.",t2_9hmjt4v3,1635717275,prochoice

Thoughts on respect toward forced-birth advocates,"I've seen comments here that we need to treat them as they treat us: insulting them and so on. It makes total sense why people feel this way; we are being dehumanized down to our core, treated as vessels whose purpose is to serve others with all our being, whose suffering is ""just nature"" and an acceptable price to pay. I'm not going to sit here preaching at anyone about the anger they feel.

But there is a lot of this on major pro-choice/pro-abortion platforms, the few that there are, at least on Twitter where pro-forced birth activist groups use everything we say to their full advantage. If not outright insulting comments, then sarcasm and mockery. (There have been posts lately here condoning ignoring their rules on their sub, which it does not reflect well on us to allow.) These people's minds can change, but it has never happened as a result of disrespect. Sparring matches are not activism; they are just venting frustration at the expense of progress and of women who will suffer from being unable to terminate a pregnancy.

We *can* be blunt and uncompromising without being abrasive. Instead, drop the ""soft"" approach by telling the truth about the bodily and psychological harm pregnancy causes. Pro-choice people have been told by other choicers that they cannot call pregnancy parasitic, say that it physically hurts women, that this forced use of women's bodies is slavery, or that forced use of their vaginas is rape. THAT is the ""niceness"" that is hurting us.

Terrible debate I took part in today,"I made the mistake of arguing with an anti choicer today out of pure frustration for the things he was saying to the other people debating him, here is some of his arguments that specifically disgusted me: 

1) You shouldn’t have sex if you don’t want to get pregnant, EVEN if you are taking precautions such as birth control and condoms because you have to recognize that birth control is not always effective. 
To this, I argued that consent to sex is NOT consent to pregnancy and to act like procreation is the only function of sex is a biological fallacy. If people do everything necessary to not become pregnant and still do they should not be held accountable for the failure of their birth control, right? He disagreed, of course. 
2) why should we “kill the baby” instead of giving it a chance in the foster care system? 
He told me this one after I told him the surmounting data that the foster care system is terrible, he still thought that we should “give the baby a chance to survive the system” as if surviving = thriving in any sense. 
3) and OF COURSE he told me that life objectively begins at conception and ALL scientists agree on this. 
This one is self explanatory why it’s bad. For one, this is not a medical consensus and there is plenty of disagreement over when life begins because it depends on your own personal beliefs regarding personhood. Even if it was alive, the right to live does not mean the right to use someone else to live. My most important pro choice argument is that everyone has the right to their own bodily autonomy and if anything relies on your body to survive you have every right to stop that relationship. If I am hooked up in a blood transfusion to someone else who is requiring taking my blood to survive and I don’t want to allow them to use my body for survival any longer, I have EVERY RIGHT to do so. 
4) he was okay with abortion only in cases of rape but said that abortion from rape is “1%” of abortions. 
There is no way that this can be objectively verified considering 80% of rapes go unreported and there is a very good chance that if a woman who has had an abortion from a situation of rape was asked to take part in a study about why she got her abortion, she probably would not want to relive her trauma and talk about it. Additionally, considering his argument is that all “life” from conception is important, what makes a fetus that is the product of rape less important than a fetus that is the product of consensual sex? Why does that fetus deserve to be “killed?” 

Anyway, aside from my rant here I would love to hear what else people have to say about these arguments and maybe what you would’ve said to him instead. Of course he did not change his narrative that “killing babies is wrong” and as a man who will never experience pregnancy, did not change his opinion.",t2_448nc60b,1635665648,prochoice

Some Anti-Autonomy'ers Don't Actually Know What The Law They Support Entails..,"So, I was debating on the pro-birth subreddit and I saw a bunch of crazy arguments. Ranging from sex being only for reproduction, to women are meant to be mothers, and some frankly frightening beliefs I never knew existed. A particular argument stood out to me though, and basically I brought up a point on how rape and incest victims would be denied access to abortion, how anyone associated with the abortion could be sued. This person apparently thought Abott was this considerate man who thought of rape and incest victims, and I guess to them this law would only punish those stupid promiscuous women who deserved it. They said those victims had access to abortion, when disputed they said they had a 6 week timeframe to get an abortion which is more than enough time. Then their argument fell apart when I said it counts since the last period which gives women one to two weeks in reality. I guess I wondered, how could you support a law and not consider what it actually entails? They also didnt know anyone associated with it could be sued (ie Uber drivers) They painted this picture of Abott as some moral saviour who also considers rape and incest victims, not even thinking to watch interviews he did on the subject. There was one where a reporter literally asked why there were no exceptions for rape and incest victims and Abott defending that under his law. This makes me think that critical thinking is lacking for some supporters. I also had that same person say abortion was not healthcare or a medical service and kept spamming ""which is it?? Primary Secondary or Quaternary??"" 

Another crazy thing that happened was after debating with another person just using science with basic logic they couldnt actually counter my points. They started to full on beg me and trying to get my sympathy..for a zygote. ""You atleast support the heartbeat law right??"" It was like they lost all composure. Then I stated my reason for not supporting the heartbeat law accompanied by a judge striking this law down calling it unconstitutional and they went silent.

There isnt much logic this movement is founded on so I think their little world where a zygote trumps a person is easily broken. When it is and all their arguments break down they just dont know how to function, either going on emotional rants or accusing you of being a baby killer. Im not even American but this movement is just so odd and intriguing to me.",t2_dk1zcuav,1635606281,prochoice
(Shower thought) is the reason men tend to have such distate towards women having their own rights... because *they* feel entitled toward our biological ability to make a baby with them?,"Bit of a mouthful there, sorry. But I was just thinking about a conversation I had with a friend yesterday. I'm pretty staunchly childfree and have no problem getting my tubes tied (or even removed) in the next couple of years. My friend said ""you know I'm pretty open to the idea of having kids."" And he continues on by saying ""I know it's a little easier for me to say things like that because I'm not the one that's being put in danger in order to bring a child into this world."" And I thought about it this morning and I was thinking ""well if he understands the dangers and that he's not entitled to someone giving him a baby, could that be the reason other men do have a problem with it."" 

Do men feel the need to oppress our rights and ability to control our bodies because they don't want us aborting *their* ""babies""? Does any of this actually have to do with the ZEF at all? 

Does the fact that by proxy of oppressing our rights, they in turn are ""helping save babies"", and because it's a bit barbaric to say things like ""women don't deserve rights"" and ""I'm entitled to a baby"", the reason prolifers take the latter and go on a fucking marathon with it?

"""The Subjection of Women"" -- It's Still True Today!"," In 1869, John Stuart Mill wrote quite a lengthy essay titled ***""The Subjection of Women,***"" and in it he made what I feel are many valid arguments. While his essay dealt with the possible reasons why so many men feared giving women the legal right to vote, I think Mill's arguments could be applied to why so many prolifers want abortion-ban laws passed in every state in the U.S.

This is the quote that resonates most strongly with me, especially the bolded part of it:

*""I should like to hear somebody openly enunciating the doctrine (it is already implied in much that is written on the subject):* ***'It is necessary to society that women should marry and produce children. They will not do so unless compelled. Therefore it is necessary to compel them.'*** *""*

Sound familiar? It sure does to me, even though Mill wrote these words more than 100 years ago. In my view, the current abortion-ban laws are just another way to compel women to *""produce children,""* whether some women **want** to produce them or not. And I have NO doubt whatsoever that prolifers will continue to deny that compelling women to produce children is their ultimate goal. But I am convinced it **IS** their goal nevertheless, and I think it needs to be stated constantly, no matter how many prolifers try to gaslight us into believing otherwise.

Does anyone doubt that the subjection of women is still true today for far-right ""prolife"" politicians, in Texas or in any other red state?  Because I certainly don't!  ",t2_2usxiyob,1635515606,prochoice

Oklahoma Supreme Court puts temporary hold on 3 abortion laws due to go into effect next week,"BY: [**Amanda Mills**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/amanda-mills/) \- October 26, 2021

Read the article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/10/26/oklahoma-supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-3-abortion-laws-due-to-go-into-effect-next-week/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/10/26/oklahoma-supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-3-abortion-laws-due-to-go-into-effect-next-week/)

The Oklahoma Supreme Court just temporarily blocked three abortion restrictions, preventing them from going into effect on November 1st while the legality of these laws are debated. 

According to [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oklahoma-supreme-court-abortion_n_61774729e4b010d93314f32d), the court’s 5-3 ruling temporarily blocks a law that would have allowed only board-certified OB/GYNs to perform the procedure ― a move that reproductive rights advocates said would cut the state’s number of providers in half. The other two laws would make it more difficult for patients to obtain a medication abortion, using what’s known as the abortion pill, by requiring providers of the medication to have certain hospital admitting privileges and forcing patients to undergo an ultrasound before taking the pills ― a policy that would require multiple trips to clinics.

“What a relief, to have these potentially devastating laws blocked from taking effect next week. Pregnant people in Oklahoma, particularly Black and brown people, already need to jump through seemingly endless hoops to access health care. These restrictions would have pushed abortion out of reach entirely for many,” says Tamya Cox, the co-chair of Oklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice. 

Many abortion rights advocacy groups applaud the court’s decision, and being right next to Texas, think it is a priority to keep Oklahoma abortion accessible for their residents as well as Texas residents. 

Even though supporters of these three laws will most likely appeal yesterday’s court decision, it is still a victory for human rights. 

“The Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized that these laws would cause irreparable harm to Oklahomans. All of these laws have the same goal: to make it harder to get an abortion in Oklahoma. We will continue to fight in court to ensure these laws are struck down for good. Politicians should not be meddling in the private health decisions of Oklahomans,” says Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights. 

Earlier this month, a district court judge temporarily blocked two other new anti-abortion laws from taking effect next month, including a measure similar to a Texas abortion ban that effectively bans the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, reports [AP](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-business-health-reproductive-rights-oklahoma-0dfdc7b4d18234431acfcf5473420be8). ",t2_2chu0rj6,1635304657,prochoice

""Medical emergency"" is not defined by the act in a way which would preclude determinations of medical emergencies of mental health (not that such an act could, since mental health is physical), thereby allowing a physician to make a determination of medical emergency on the basis of a patient's distress at being pregnant or carrying their pregnancy to term, pregnancy-related dysphoria, or prenatal depression (to name a few cases). Moreover, and more legally consequential in my opinion, restrictions on abortion lead to pregnant people pursuing less safe methods of abortion, acts which can be fatal or lead to debilitating sequelae, and such an evaluated *intent*, i.e. to self-harm, or pursue a self-induced or amateur abortion, thereby constitutes a necessitating medical emergency under the act.

There should be bodily autonomy constitutional amendment!,"But there likely won't be anytime soon if ever. I'm no lawyer, but from most sources, it seems that abortion really is not constitutional right and that it was created by the Supreme Court. Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself originally opposed the ruling, as she believed that right for an abortion should come from the people.

To preface the issue, I hope that Roe v Wade won't be overturned next week (although this will likely be irrelevant, as pretty much every Republican state will keep enacting Christian sharia laws until Roe is no more), but maybe it shouldn't have been in the first place, as Christian right wouldn't have the one issue to play political football with and the issue would have been meanwhile resolved by constitutional amendment.

I think that such amendment is actually doable and could very well be proposed and ratified within 10 years if Democrats really wanted to. I think they won't do it, because then they would significant number of voters who vote for reproductive rights alone.

I would love such amendment if it:

A. Obviously codified bodily autonomy into the constitution, making it possible to do anything with your body as you please. End pregnancy, your own life or even to allow you to ruin your body from within with dangerous substances and to get gender reassignment.

B. Provide with exceptions to protect other people's lives or to limit it based on age and sanity.

C. Besides providing you with the right to control your body, also massively expand your freedom of information about your body. This would force companies to honestly reveal what you put into your body and also forbid abstinence-only ""sex education"" and Pregnancy Crisis Centres, among other things.

Here's my crappy proposition:

Section 1: ""To ensure right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, no state nor the Congress shall deprave any person of their bodily autonomy, any right to control their own body nor to information necessary to give informed consent.""

Section 2: ""The only exceptions to this right shall be punishments for a crime, to protect other person's bodily autonomy and exemption on the basis of person's ability to give informed consent.""

Section 3: ""Congress shall have the power to enforce this amendment with appropriate legislation.""

What do you think of that? English is my second language, so my wording likely sucks, maybe you could help me fix it.

It should also have section 4, which would clarify that the government shouldn't have the power to provide people with accurate information, because if that was the case, it would give them the power to create their own truth, rather than just protect scientifically accurate information and it would basically destroy the first amendment.

Major Flaw in PL Logic,"Premise: a fetus is a fully fledged individual deserving as rights, and it also is a dependent on the mother. It is similar to an infant or a small child. 

Using this premise, which I feel almost all PL positions hold as true, we can show that the logical conclusion is that some women should not be permitted to reproduce. We can also show, that because the usual PL argument is that sex is for reproduction, we should also not allow these women to engage in sex acts that have the risk of pregnancy, even if it is a very small risk. 

Conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and age, carry with them a not insignificant risk of either miscarriage or health issues for the fetus and baby once born. There are also numerous other generic disorders that increase this risk, and even pose long-lasting impact on the person for their entire life after being born. 

You are not allowed to bring a child into an unsafe environment. This is a given in most societies, and is called child endangerment or something similar. The child does not have to be hurt for this to be the case (though if they are harmed it is a worse crime) they only have to be in danger. An example is leaving your child in a bad neighborhood (this is actually the example many legal textbooks give). 

One example of a medical condition is having a BMI of greater than 25% which has roughly a 20-30% increased risk of miscarriage. No one would say it is OK to put a child in a situation that increases their likelihood of dying by even a few percent: miscarriage risk is estimated at over 40% for a healthy fetus in optimal situations, so even on the low end this means we're increasing the risk of death by at least 5% which is huge. 

How can we justify bringing a fetus into an unsafe situation, be it a mother who is obese or has some other health issue, that poses very significant risk to the fetus?

Should women who are aware of these issues not be permitted to reproduce? Why or why not?

Bonus question: should these women be permitted to having heterosexual intercourse at all? Certainly any chance of conceiving will be immoral, so should we also not ban them from having sex with men who are fertile?",t2_ej7qdrts,1635169752,prochoice

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1635148815,prochoice
Potential cause for rising infertility,"Could it be an evolutionary mutation that there are growing infertility rates in world human populations due to pregnancy risking health and lifespans of people, especially women?
I know it's also cause of the terrible environment we live in and crappy food we eat and stressful lifestyles.
Or the overheating of the planet as well.

But could it be part of the explanation of this?

Living in Texas with a uterus,"I cannot fathom how disgusted and horrified I am to leave my house because of the abortion law in my state that my family has lived in for eight generations. 

This law has made my agoraphobia 10x worse. I am in fear of being raped and unable to have an abortion. I fear for the trans men who are in my state. I cannot take birth control or anything like that. There is nothing I can do except carry a pocket knife and mace on me everywhere I go and pray to whatever force is listening that nothing bad happens. 

I don’t care what you believe in. If you support the bill that is ruining lives, making young children have to give birth, and are okay with a fetus being born as a product or rape or being unwanted, you are a terrible human being.

GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS.,"I just found such a great pro choice statement, I loved it.

So basically there was a video of a pro lifer trying to argue that an unborn fetus is a baby. 

A pro choice woman created another video responding to this original video and made some GREAT points. You might have heard them before but I just thought I'd share because they were so smart. 

It basically went: 

***If an unborn fetus is a baby then we should have life insurance on them. People who get miscarriages should be compensated. Men should pay child support as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed. Maternity leave should also start as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Pregnant people on low income should get food stamps  and welfare for the baby. We should be able to claim the baby on our income taxes. Assaulting a pregnant woman should also be considered child abuse.***

People love to act like an unborn fetus is a baby when it comes to abortion, but when it comes to treating this fetus as an actual human being, they don't care.",t2_bdl1nubw,1635084773,prochoice

"Prochoicers that want kids, how do/did you feel about pregnancy?","Obviously if people want kids, they are willing to endure pregnancy and childbirth. If they don't, they aren't willing to go through that. Prolifers seem to then be of the opinion that ""no one avoids pregnancy for the sake of avoiding pregnancy."" Which I think is an inappropriate framing and I think that there are absolutely people like that out there. We just don't typically see people saying that because you know... we have a choice. Not to mention the culture of dismissal of pain and suffering that afab people experience. Or the constant grooming to make us be caregivers that don't complain for the sake of others. Pregnancy is frequently belittled and dismissed - the very fact that prolifers think that abortion is unrelated to avoiding pregnancy highlights this perfectly.

So, I am curious how many people would actually like the pregnancy experience. I, personally would like to experience it, but am terrified of experiencing childbirth.

An epiphany about Prolife,"So I feel like, lately, I’ve been able to put myself in the shoes of a lot of prolifers. Their religious bent was extremely alienating to me, which I think severely clouded my understanding of their mindset. But I think I’ve finally been able to work through that and figure out how and why they work, and why arguing with them is futile. 

The epiphany is that these people fear death more than anything else. They believe death is the worst fate someone “innocent” could endure. Of course, “innocent” is a vague term, but I think most of us believe that fetuses and young children are distanced from morality as individual actors and have a sort of “innocence” about them. This is what causes Prolifers to think that the non-accidental death of a fetus is unjust because “they never wronged you on purpose.” 

Of course, we have plenty of answers to the “innocence” line, but these people think death is *bad.* There is no “neutral” death for them, like we believe. You either intentionally kill because someone wronged you, or you kill because you intend to wrong them. No amount of sentience or autonomy arguments will change their minds. The organism just has to be “human enough” to fall into their moral equation (which is why the “potential zygote”/separate gametes argument doesn’t work with them). 

Because of this “do or die” moral framework, in the face of the very binding nature of pregnancy, the suffering of others against their will is *morally necessary* to prevent the big bad death. Any alternative is not an option, and grey areas are extremely troubling for them (like the trimester cutoff points). 

After putting myself in this mindset, I’ve come to realize how easy and calming it is to be prolife. It also becomes glaringly obvious how many factors you either have to ignore or be ignorant of. Being prochoice is so incredibly messy by comparison, but you can’t put the Pandora of knowledge back in the box (at least, for most of us).

Anti abortion is killing us," I've been so livid right now. I dont know why people think they can make other people's healthcare decisions for them. My friend almost died from her pregnancy and considered abortion so she could take care of her two others kids. 4 of my friends were raped and two didnt get pregnant because one had an IUD and the other's rapist wore a condom.   


I also tried to get a checkup and an IUD from planned parenthood. They would not help me because my insurance didnt cover it. How is someone supposed to be forced to have a pregnancy because they couldnt get the right healthcare? The same people who dont want free healthcare are the ones who dont want people to have abortions.

AUTONOMY,"Why cant’s anti-choicers understand the simple concept of bodily autonomy.

Some even support terminating it because 'there's no chance they will wake up whereas a fetus (baby) if left to continue, will become a person' The argument based on 'potential' is already stupid, however, the bodies that are brain dead/etc absolutely COULD wake up.

Being pro-life is convenient,"It is very easy being pro life. You know you're right, you don't have to think about all the messy details. It is easy to know who to support and who to vote for. You don't have to consider policy, and you get to feel like you are better than pro choice individuals because you have the moral high ground.

How do I convince my pro-life family of my abortion decision..?,"Throw away account since I'm too easily identifiable. 

First things first I love my parents and they love me too . But my parents are very pro life, they aren't religious but just think abortion is wrong and is killing. I am 8w right now, just found out about this a week ago. 

My original intend was to keep it since my husband and I really love kids and really wanted one. So we told my parents and they were super excited as this would've been their first grandchild. But after some consideration we realized we are both in the middle of the climb in our career and is just not a good time to have a child. 

I'm crying over this everyday since i know my mother especially will be really upset by my action. She's a sweet little lady but it's just the pro choice aspect we don't agree. Now I could just lie and tell her I miscarried. But one, she's a doctor for 25+ years (not a gyn, just a family Dr, but knows enough). I'm scared that she's going to fine out I lied and actually had an abortion...this would really damage our relationship further... and now I'm staying with my parents since our house is under some Reno so if I go with a med abortion she can definitely tell ...and being this early I really don't want to go through a surgical one since that is more invasive (my OB doesn't recommend it either).

So please, anyone has any advise on how I could go with this? And for the record I'm in one of the mega red states where everyone around us is mostly pro life. And I don't know how many people my parents told this to but I'm scared if I have an abortion people around me would judge. So I need something convincing.

Not exactly pro choice or pro life related question but do you think teen pregnancy is normalized in the West?

"I was a ""Sister of Angels""","I posted this a couple of months ago, but have edited it in order to more effectively tell my story. I hope that this resonates with someone, because it is not just an ex-prolifer story, but a story about dealing with personal trauma while coming of age in these uncertain times. Disclaimer that this post is really, *really* long. I understand that most people don't want to read through all this, but if you do, I greatly appreciate it.

•••••••••••

I was a ""Sister of Angels"". My mom had two abortions. She told me about them when I was 8 years old. We were in the car and someone on the radio mentioned abortion, and I asked her what abortions were. After she told me, I looked up at the clouds, forming images in my mind of what might have been. I'd always wanted a sister, and now I knew that I'd *had* one. I looked at my little brother, feeling a newfound gratitude for his existence and mine, and then I carried on with my trip as though nothing had happened. 8 was *way* too early to share such sensitive information with me, but my mom did not have boundaries. A year and a half later, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

I was 14 years old when I saw gory photos of ""late term abortions"" while trying to do a school project on fetal development. I would later find out that these photos were mostly fake, but at the time, I believed that my siblings (both aborted at about 8 weeks) had looked like this. I thought that late term abortions were common- that fetuses at the same point of gestation as I had been at birth (31 weeks) could still be aborted on demand. As far as I was concerned, my siblings had been tortured, murdered, and then thrown in the trash- and they were just two of 50 million babies that had suffered the same fate.

To say that I was a lonely child was an understatement. My mother's family was extremely insular, and she raised me the same way she was raised- completely isolated from ""outsiders"". I spent my time making up stories, creating imaginary companions to make up for my lack of real ones. I was a great writer, but I approached my real life as though it were a story I was writing, out of a pathological need to control the world around me. I always wanted to be Miss Popularity- I wanted to be perfect, in order to prove that there was nothing wrong with me. I would ""pick"" someone in my class to be my ""best friend"" every year; I didn't really know how friendship worked, that one didn't ""pick"" people like casting them for a play. Later on, I was the disposable friend in the group, going to school feeling sick to my stomach because I didn't know whether they would accept or reject me today. An older sister would have been my companion. She would have painted my nails and done my makeup. She would have introduced me to her friends. She would have taught me what genuine friendship felt like so I knew where to look for it in others. Instead, she was a pile of biomedical waste.

It was easy for me to be against abortion, since I was already full of prejudices against sex. I developed these to protect myself from my mother, who as I said, did not have boundaries. She sexualized everything from my favorite songs to the fact that I kept inadvertently showing my butt because my jeans were too low-rise. At the time, I thought it was my fault- she sexualized me because she thought I was ""bad"" somehow, and I had to prove to her that I was ""good"". I went to the opposite extreme, loudly proclaiming my disgust for all things remotely sexual while secretly reading the reproductive system chapter in her anatomy textbook over and over. My fear of being perceived as sexual made puberty incredibly traumatic; when I got my period, I was so embarrassed that I didn't tell anyone for six months. Even as I suffered in shame, my mom still didn't believe me. She always told me that deep down I was as sexual as she was, and that time would prove her right. And even as I protested, part of me believed her, and was waiting for this time to come. But at 14, this time had still not come, and ""if you don't want a baby, just don't have sex!""seemed like a valid answer to the abortion debate. I think I knew deep down that I was being disingenuous when I said that, but these were the kinds of things I had to say to survive- to maintain some semblance of self separate from my mother.

My grandmother, who we moved in with when I was 11, helped me along with my prejudice against sex. She once gave me a book of Christian devotions for girls that interpreted the Seventh Commandment as stating that it was a sin not only to have sex outside of marriage at all, but to have sexual thoughts of anyone you weren't married to. She had been a nurse at a Maternity and Infant Care clinic, so she had *some* empathy for women who had abortions, but her personal values told another story; she *claimed* to have only had sex with one man in her entire life, and wore this like a badge of honor.  Completely unaware of her issues, my child self hung onto her every word, as her ""replacement"" daughter after she lost her only daughter when I was 2. My aunt had been a pregnant teen in the days before abortion was legal, and gave two babies up for adoption. She was never the same after that, becoming obese and dying of a heart attack at 50. I was scared of being like my mother, but I was scared of being like her too, especially when my grandmother started to use her short life as a scare tactic on me- don't eat that, cover up, you're lazy and vain. Still, my grandmother gave me the impression that as long as I lived a ""pure"" life, one day my prince would come save me and we would live happily ever after. I looked for this ""prince"" in practically every boy who spoke to me, projecting my fantasies onto any available target. As I said, I approached my real life as though it were a story, although I wouldn't realize that this was tied up with my grandmother until the same thing both destroyed my narrative and took her life. 

After I saw those pictures at 14, I took my anti-abortion views to school. I said those exact words, ""if you don't want a baby, just don't have sex!""- a statement which drew ire from my peers and teachers alike. Afterwards, I told my best friend that I was a ""Sister of Angels""- the first, but certainly not the last, time I'd ever told anyone that. She was supportive- or at least pretended to be. One week later, she told me she might be pregnant. I reacted exactly as one would expect a pro-life 14 year old with control issues to react. She said that she’d had sex because family problems had made her upset and confused. Upset and confused? My mother’s tumor was growing again. She was getting worse every day. *I* was upset and confused. I now realize how incredibly narcissistic it was to make this about me, but narcissism was all I knew- my family was full of it. My friend said she was considering an abortion, and I was determined to stop her at all costs. One day we fought about it and she stormed off, leaving me crying in the Walgreens we always hung out in. I searched ""pro-life videos"" on YouTube for the first of many times that day. I didn’t see her for a few days after that, and when I did, she acted as if nothing had ever happened. The next week, our final week of middle school, my other best friend told me the whole thing was a prank. She was never pregnant. It was a sick test, and I had been betrayed by my ""friends"" yet again.

I hadn't had my period in 3 months at that point. I went to the doctor, who made me take a pregnancy test. Of course, I was a virgin. Even so, it was a humiliating, shame-ridden experience, as one would expect when I had spent years proclaiming my disgust at sex and was now left holding a freaking *pregnancy test* despite having never even kissed anyone. I decided I never wanted to see another pregnancy test again until I wanted a child. So I took a pledge to myself that I would never have sex until I was married. I didn't know, even though I kind of had an idea, that my circumstances had already taken a vow of celibacy for me. I heard the voices of my bullies in my head- *""you shouldn't worry about staying abstinent with a face like that""*. I was afraid that they were right, even more than I was afraid of having to take another pregnancy test.

I lost at least the next year of my life to being a ""Sister of Angels"". I read anti-abortion blogs. I watched anti-abortion videos. I made tribute after tribute to my older siblings- named them (Avery and Cassandra), wrote poems about them, bought two angel pins meant to represent them. It was a compulsion. I wanted to stop. I was starting high school at the time, and desperately wanted to move on- I had a ""plan"" to become Miss Popularity, and I knew I couldn't do that with abortion as a millstone around my neck. I made a lot of superficial connections at first, but was left out of the deeper ones, gradually becoming the disposable friend in the group once more.That just made me long for my older siblings even more. I would talk about them with anyone who would listen- the guidance counselor at school, the support group for children of cancer patients that I went to, every relative I ever spoke to. I thought that, if I kept talking, I would eventually say something that made sense. The messages that I was picking up from pro-life, purity culture sources were affecting me in other ways, too- I was completely lost in fantasies of my ""prince"", still looking for him in almost every boy that spoke to me. I desperately wanted real life to be a story that I could control, which was the same reason I kept searching for ""closure"" for my older siblings. I always told myself that this article, this conversation, this poem would finally allow me to move on with my life. But this was real life, not the story I wanted it to be, and there was no such thing as closure.

My mom died at the end of that year. The second thing I said after getting the news was, “she died thinking I hated her”. Two weeks later, my fundamentalist Christian cousin took me to an event for ""women's organizations"", including a crisis pregnancy center. I asked her if she thought women who had abortions went to Hell, and she said that those who repented were saved. My mother had not ""repented"". I could not accept that answer, so I shut down. Was I pro-life? Was I pro-choice? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I was full of guilt.

Trump was elected the year after that. I, like so many others, was terrified. I thought that 14 year old me might get her wish to see abortion made illegal- potentially at the expense of a future me. I wondered about getting on birth control while it was still accessible, even though I was still the virginest virgin that ever virgined. At this point, my peers were starting to have sex, and I started to resent my virginity even as I clung to it. I still heard the voices of my bullies in my head- *""well, obviously you're still a virgin, who would want to have sex with you?""* I'd had a boyfriend, but I wasn't actually attracted to him, so there'd been no need to worry about breaking my ""pledge""- I had reluctantly gone with him because I wanted the validation of someone desiring me. I wanted to lose my virginity for the same reason- although I mostly fantasized about being in passionate love with someone, part of me would have taken a hookup to be like the ""cool kids"". But I was unable to pursue either one, because of fear- fear that my bullies had been right and no one would want me, and fear that if I did successfully get what I so craved, I would end up repeating my mother's and aunt's mistakes. I looked forward to college, and the crazy party culture there, believing that there I would be freed from my limitations and could ""make up"" for all the social opportunities that I had missed earlier in life. Still, I put on the same prudish front that I had been putting on my entire life, especially for my family- I needed to, in order to separate myself from my now-dead mother that they were searching for a replacement for. 

I realized the futility of this the year after that, when, on our way to tour a college, my uncle showed me an article about college hookup culture and impressed upon me that getting pregnant would ruin my life. It was then that I realized that, in spite of me saying things like ""if you don't want a baby, don't have sex"" for years, I still could not separate myself from my mother. Then what the hell had I gone through all of that shame and alienation and emotional turmoil *for?* I asked myself that question into my senior year, when I found out that the guy I’d hoped would be my ""prince"" back when I was a chastity-pledging 14 year old had slept with seemingly everyone in our social circle besides me. All anyone could talk about was all the parties I hadn't been invited to and all the sex I hadn't been having. I was locked into being the weird, boring girl that people kept around for entertainment and to cheat off on tests. I resented everyone who had put me in this position- mostly myself, but even my older siblings, piles of biomedical waste that they were, were not exempt- although they obviously were incapable of doing anything, I could resent the conceptions of them I had created in my head for daring to exist. Now I was left holding a ton of baggage that I didn't want, with no way to put it down. That was, until I got to college. I got into my dream school and believed that the narrative of my life had finally come to a happy resolution. There was more pain to come- I ended up not going to prom because I was betrayed by my ""friends'' yet again- but, even as I continued to be depressed and let opportunities pass me by, I desperately held onto the hope that it would all be better in college.

I went to college the year after that- angry, desperate, and prepared to do a complete 180. Like with high school, I made a lot of superficial connections at first (via our class group chat), but the mask fell almost as soon as I actually got to campus. College party culture puts all of one's insecurities under a microscope, and I wasn't the slightest bit equipped to deal with it. Often I didn't even really want to be out, but I needed the validation of finally getting to party after everything that had happened in high school. I wanted to hook up- again, for validation- but no one approached me in those first few weeks. *""LOL, you're too ugly to get laid even in college!""* blared in my head so loudly that it was impossible to think clearly. I did and said and thought so many stupid and unethical and even dangerous things, out of utter desperation for someone, anyone, to find me attractive. I was entirely caught up in narrativizing my life- I walked around campus listening to songs from Broadway musicals, rewriting them into a ""musical"" about my college life. Most of these writings featured my mother and/or my older siblings as ghosts, either helping or hindering my journey. It's hard to overstate how omnipresent they were in my mind. My mom's first abortion was when she was a freshman in college, right before she dropped out and started over. That story existed in every failed midterm, every guy that felt me up in a frat house basement. The first time I blacked out, I went into hysterics about my mother, crying (among other things) ""she killed my sister!"" The second time, I almost went back to the room of a guy I'd just met, a few days after I had a philosophy lesson on abortion that perfectly explained the pro-choice position and ""freed"" me from the (ideological, at least) burdens of four years past. Still, even while he was kissing me, I imagined my older siblings desperately trying to stop me from making the same mistake that created them. It was only because of my best friend intervening that I, a virgin who had been ""saving myself"" just four years earlier, didn't bang a stranger that night. I tried to get on birth control after that, concerned that this was the beginning of a pattern, but was so bad at being on time to things that I missed several appointments. My life was falling apart at this point; I was not doing my assignments, binge drinking whenever I had the chance, and physically ill with symptoms similar to those my mom had before her diagnosis. My two best friends were also mentally ill and making poor life decisions. One of them, like my mother, had absolutely no sexual boundaries; like my mother, he was entitled, had no respect for the word no, and was prone to fly into a rage if his ego was wounded. As the year went on, he got worse, she got more like him, and I became further and further alienated from them. I didn't want to be in this sordid downward spiral anymore, but I felt helpless to do anything about it. I figured that this was simply what my mother had said was going to happen, and that time was finally proving her right.

The year after that, I was betrayed by my ""friends"" yet again, as the downward spiral hit rock bottom. I was left with even more shame than I'd had before. If no longer being the prude I was in high school had gotten me into that hypersexual clown car of failing grades and poor decisions, then I would be that same prude forever, as long as I could be smart and sweet and safe again. I had lost my main social circle, and spent most of my time hiding in my room, but I was still narrativizing my life, and the narrative said that I would rush a sorority after getting off of academic probation and I would have a social life again. That was the only thing that kept me going that semester, but after I got off probation, things started to go off script. I had a panic attack on my 20th birthday, and cried the night before I was supposed to return to campus, not wanting to go back. Still, I rushed the sorority, but I suppose I wanted it too much- or my former friends had been spreading their lies about me. I was rejected and checked into the campus counseling center the next day. Within one month I was working with a trauma-informed therapist.

It was then that I began to learn. I learned that I was not uniquely broken, but that my ""brokenness"" was the result of generational trauma that had been present in my family long before I was born. I learned that I couldn't do assignments or be on time because of ADHD, had been unable to stop obsessing over abortion because of Pure-O OCD, and still heard the voices of my bullies in my head because of C-PTSD. I learned that a mother showing her 9 year old her sexual aids is a kind of child abuse called ""covert incest"", and that it was in no way the 9 year old's fault. I learned that my brain-tumor-like symptoms were caused by ""conversion disorder"", brought on by the psychological pain of losing my mother. I learned that putting things in the vagina was not supposed to sting even as a virgin, and that that was called ""vaginismus""- I finally had my first gynecological exam (at a local clinic that also provides abortions, so I was wondering ""is this where it happened?"" the entire time) and it left me with searing pain and no improvement in my comfort with my body. And I learned why I'd taken up the mantle of being a ""Sister of Angels'' all those years ago- I'd really meant ""Sister of a Living, Breathing Abused Autistic Boy"". My little brother, the one childhood playmate I could count on, was diagnosed at 3. He is nonverbal, so I was always the one speaking for him, which was where I learned to control and project onto others. Our mother had refused to accept his disability, and once she had, she'd abused him for it- and I had followed her lead. I had become her way to ""make up"" for him, to hide the fact that our family had ""something wrong"", which was why I had to prove myself by owning sparkly pink crap and wanting to be prom queen. I'd pined for my aborted siblings as though I didn't have a living one right in front of me, but really, being pro-life was a way to protect him. He, like my other siblings, was unwanted. It so easily could have been him in a biohazard bag- my mother once confessed that sometimes she wished this was the case. I felt terribly guilty being the only wanted one, and even I knew what it felt like to be unwanted, so I tried to protect the unwanted in the only way I knew how.

That said, I am not pro-life, and have not been for a very long time. As part of relinquishing my pathological need to control, I let go of my need to control others' medical decisions, especially since I know that I might make the same choice were I to end up in that situation. I used to associate being pro-choice with being sexually indiscriminate, but now I know that ""women should have the right to an abortion"" (or even ""if I have an unwanted pregnancy I will abort"") and ""I only want to have sex with someone I trust"" are two statements that are not in any way mutually exclusive. Being pro-life would make sense in a perfect world- where rape and abuse never happen, where everyone has access to gainful employment and childcare, where many of these aborted fetuses would not have been born just to be dead children. I know that I do not live in a perfect world, and to be honest, I knew that at 14. I knew that every time I had to step over my mother lying on the floor because the tumor destroyed her balance and rush out the door to a school where the sight of my so-called ""friends"" made me want to throw up from fear. But I remained enveloped in a narrative- one where I controlled everything, but one where my relationships, my beliefs, my very *thoughts* were not real.

Then the pandemic hit, and I, like so many others, lost the world that I had lived in before. I was already struggling to do my assignments while also starting trauma recovery, but once everything moved online, I stopped going to class entirely and had another bomb-out semester. I decided to take a leave of absence; originally in the class of 2022, I will now graduate in 2024. Going on leave shattered any pretense of having a normal college experience, or of being normal at all- things had gone completely off script, and without a narrative to follow, I lost all hope. My grandmother became a statistic- one of almost 5 million and counting lives ended by the virus. It was only after her death that I realized the hold she'd had over me. The shame that had kept me silent about my period for half a year, the religious beliefs that had supplemented that shame and caused me so much fear, the fantasies of finding my ""prince"" that had soothed my longing heart for years- it was all tied up with her. I had constructed my worldview around her, and now that she was gone, I was again left holding baggage that I didn't want and couldn't put down. Part of me found other ways to hold onto said baggage; I fell into TERF communities online and became against pornography, attempting to cease my own consumption of it just like I did as a 14 year old in purity culture but convincing myself that this was *totally* not the same. And part of me wanted to burn the entire suitcase, but I was afraid to- I was afraid that I would repeat the mistakes I'd made my freshman year of college, and more than anything, I didn't want to feel that unsafe again.

It was this year that I realized that, despite the pain of losing my grandmother and all she represented, I am free now. There are no more ideals of purity or perfection to live up to, no more scripts that I need life to follow. But freedom felt empty. I was left staring into the void that the losses of 2020 left behind, asking, what now? Only recently have I begun to construct a new hope. I'm starting to want to do things for myself again- eat healthy, care for my appearance, get rid of the tension I've been carrying in my body for almost 22 years. Once again I have an image of a future that I can look forward to, but unlike all those fairytale endings of the past that didn't pan out, this one is not based upon a narrative. Only by *living*, not narrativizing, will I finally encounter the people and things that are truly meant for me.

One of the things I lost, that left behind a void, was my belief in organized religion. My concept of God was always very closed-minded, although I was not technically raised in the church. As a child, I accepted anything that claimed to be the word of God, because I was absolutely terrified of being disobedient. This, of course, primed me for purity culture to traumatize me. The older I got, and the smarter I became, the less those scare tactics worked on me. Like with everything else, in the absence of religion, there was an emptiness- does life have no meaning, do we just die and that's it? However, since I was a child, I have always been a very spiritual person, and that is something that I have retained in my construction of a new hope. Particularly of interest to me is the concept of reincarnation. Back when I was pro-life at 14, I read something that raised the idea of the souls of aborted and miscarried babies coming back in the forms of later children. I realized that, if that is the case, then the lost sister that I was searching for was really me all along.",t2_13ih3u5d,1634681698,prochoice

My response to a common argument I hear,"So I'm sure you're familiar with the rhetoric thst bodily autonomy justifies abortion. Sometimes however I get the response ""What about the babies bodily autonomy?""

First of all, it's a ZEF (Zygote, Embryo, or Fetus) not a baby. Second, autonomy is necessary first which it lacks. Autonomy means the ability for someone to make independent decisions, which a ZEF obviously cannot do. In the event someone cannot do so, someone else close can make a decision for them. 

Now with this in mind, bodily autonomy also has a limit. It does not permit you to violate someone elses rights if you violate theirs first. It's why rapists and murderers cannot claim bodily autonomy to prevent you from defending yourself.

"Question for anyone who was Abandoned, Unloved, Abused, In foster care, Neglected, poor or Sexually Abused","Do you or anyone that you know who do fit into one of the category that is in the title, would say that looking back onto their life that if they were never born (aka aborted) for any of the reason then it would most likely be for the better or if they were killed at the time of there suffering then there would have been fine with it ?

I always hear of pro-life people who try to argue that it's not right to abort because a baby might suffer but I saw that a few days ago someone made a post saying how being aborted is better then foster care. So I wanna know anyone else would agree that base on their own or a friends personal experience if either being aborted would have been better in Hindsight or if being killed seem preferable then suffering their torment at the time that were going through it!

I will share my own thoughts, back in 2015 I was mentally abuse by my mother Ex fiance, now looking back in term of mental abuse I am pretty sure that other people had it worse just in general, and I don't really remember exactly all my feelings during the time of my abuse but what I can remember is that there was some days where I felt like, that if a group of robbers broke into the house and put a bullet in my head and killed me then I would probably have been thankful to the robbers. that is of course how I felt at the time.  

Again I wanna know if anyone have similar feelings, like if life would have been better if they where never born or if they where ok with dying during their time of suffering if so plz tell me",t2_4peg9a81,1634600995,prochoice

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1634544025,prochoice

I was a Sister of Angels,"I have posted this before, but have edited it in order to more effectively tell my story of how I used to be a pro-lifer. TL;DR is that my mom had two abortions before I was born, and the trauma and loneliness of my childhood caused me to idolize my would-be older siblings and be a virulent pro-lifer when I was a teenager. I really hope this resonates with someone, as it's also a story about me coming of age during these uncertain times. Disclaimer that this story is incredibly long; if you don't want to read my literal life story, press the back button. If you do, thank you for taking the time. I really appreciate it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was a ""Sister of Angels"". My mom had two abortions- one at 17 and another at 24. She told me about them when I was 8 years old. We were in the car and someone on the radio mentioned abortion, and I asked her what abortions were. After she told me, I looked up at the clouds, forming images in my mind of what might have been. I'd always wanted a big sister, and now I knew that I'd had one. I looked at my little brother, feeling a newfound gratitude for his existence and mine, and then I carried on with my trip as though nothing had happened. 8 was way too early to share such sensitive information with me, but my mom did not have appropriate boundaries. A year and a half later, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

I was 14 years old when I saw gory photos of ""late term abortions"" while trying to do a school project on fetal development. I would later find out that these photos were mostly fake, but at the time, I believed that my siblings (both aborted at about 8 weeks) had looked like this. I thought that late term abortions were common- that fetuses at the same point of gestation as I had been at birth (31 weeks) could still be aborted on demand. As far as I was concerned, my siblings had been tortured, murdered, and then thrown in the trash- and they were just two of 50 million babies that had suffered the same fate.

To say that I was a lonely child was an understatement. My mother's family was extremely insular, and she raised me the same way she was raised- completely isolated from ""outsiders"". I spent my time making up stories, creating imaginary companions to make up for my lack of real ones. I was a great writer, but I approached my real life as though it were a story I was writing, out of a pathological need to control the world around me. I always wanted to be Miss Popularity- I wanted to be perfect, in order to prove that there was nothing wrong with me. I would ""pick"" someone in my class to be my ""best friend"" every year; I didn't really know how friendship worked, that one didn't ""pick"" people like casting them for a play. Later on, I was the disposable friend in the group, going to school feeling sick to my stomach because I didn't know whether they would accept or reject me today. An older sister would have been my companion. She would have painted my nails and done my makeup. She would have introduced me to her friends. She would have taught me what genuine friendship felt like so I knew where to look for it in others. Instead, she was a pile of biomedical waste.

It was easy for me to be against abortion, since I was already full of prejudices against sex. I developed these to protect myself from my mother, who as I said, did not have boundaries. I know she lost her virginity when she was 12, and it was almost like she wanted me to do the same- probably to make herself feel better about her own past. She sexualized everything from my favorite songs to the fact that I kept inadvertently showing my butt because my jeans were too low-rise. At the time, I thought it was my fault- she sexualized me because she thought I was ""bad"" somehow, and I had to prove to her that I was ""good"". I went to the opposite extreme, loudly proclaiming my disgust for all things remotely sexual while secretly reading the reproductive system chapter in her anatomy textbook under cover of night. My fear of being perceived as sexual made puberty incredibly traumatic; when I got my period, I was so ashamed that I didn't tell anyone for six months. Even as I suffered in shame, my mom still didn't believe that I was ""good"". She always told me that deep down I was as sexual as she was, and that time would prove her right. And even as I protested, part of me believed her, and was waiting for this time to come. But at 14, this time had still not come, and ""if you don't want a baby, just don't have sex!""seemed like a valid answer to the abortion debate. I think I knew deep down that I was being disingenuous when I said that, but these were the kinds of things I had to say to survive- to maintain some semblance of self separate from my mother.

My grandmother, who we moved in with when I was 11, helped me along with my prejudice against sex. She once gave me a book of Christian devotions for girls that interpreted the Seventh Commandment as stating that it was a sin not only to have sex outside of marriage at all, but to have sexual thoughts of anyone you weren't married to. She had been a nurse at a Maternity and Infant Care clinic, so she had some empathy for women who had abortions, but her personal values told another story; she claimed to have only had sex with one man in her entire life, and wore this like a badge of honor. Completely unaware of her issues, my child self hung onto her every word, as her ""replacement"" daughter after she lost her only daughter when I was 2. My aunt had been a pregnant teen in the days before abortion was legal, and gave two babies up for adoption. She was never the same after that, becoming obese and dying of a heart attack at 50. I was scared of being like my mother, but I was scared of being like her too, especially when my grandmother started to use her short life as a scare tactic on me- don't eat that, cover up, you're lazy and vain. Still, my grandmother gave me the impression that as long as I lived a ""pure"" life, one day my prince would come save me and we would live happily ever after. I looked for this ""prince"" in practically every boy who spoke to me, projecting my fantasies onto any available target despite seldom feeling anything for them as individuals. As I said, I approached my real life as though it were a story, although I wouldn't realize that this was tied up with my grandmother until the same thing both destroyed my narrative and took her life. 

After I saw those pictures at 14, I took my anti-abortion views to school. I said those exact words, ""if you don't want a baby, just don't have sex!""- a statement which drew ire from my peers and teachers alike. Afterwards, I told my best friend that I was a ""Sister of Angels""- the first, but certainly not the last, time I'd ever told anyone that. She was supportive- or at least pretended to be. One week later, she told me she was pregnant. I reacted exactly as one would expect a pro-life 14 year old with control issues to react. She said that she’d had sex because family problems had made her upset and confused. Upset and confused? My mother’s tumor was growing again. She was getting worse every day. I was upset and confused. I now realize how incredibly narcissistic it was to make this about me, but narcissism was all I knew- my family was full of it. My friend said she was considering an abortion, and I was determined to stop her at all costs. One day we fought about it and she stormed off, leaving me crying in the Walgreens we always hung out in. I searched ""pro-life videos"" on YouTube for the first of many times that day. I didn’t see her for a few days after that, and when I did, she acted as if nothing had ever happened. The next week, our final week of middle school, my other best friend told me the whole thing was a ruse. She was never pregnant. It was a sick test, and I had been betrayed by my ""friends"" yet again.

I hadn't had my period in 3 months at that point. I went to the doctor, who made me take a pregnancy test. Of course, I was a virgin. Even so, it was a humiliating, shame-ridden experience, as one would expect when I had spent years proclaiming my disgust at sex and was now left holding a freaking pregnancy test despite having never even kissed anyone. I decided I never wanted to see another pregnancy test again until I wanted a child. So I took a pledge to myself that I would never have sex until I was married. I didn't know, even though I kind of had an idea, that my circumstances had already taken a vow of celibacy for me. I heard the voices of my bullies in my head- ""you shouldn't worry about staying abstinent with a face like that"". I was afraid that they were right, even more than I was afraid of having to take another pregnancy test.

I lost at least the next year of my life to being a ""Sister of Angels"". I read anti-abortion blogs. I watched anti-abortion videos. I made tribute after tribute to my older siblings- named them (Avery and Cassandra), wrote poems about them, bought two angel pins meant to represent them. It was a compulsion. I wanted to stop. I was starting high school at the time, and desperately wanted to move on- I had a ""plan"" to become Miss Popularity, and I knew I couldn't do that with abortion as a millstone around my neck. I made a lot of superficial connections at first, but was left out of the deeper ones, gradually becoming the disposable friend in the group once more. That just made me long for my older siblings even more. I would talk about them with anyone who would listen- the guidance counselor at school, the support group for children of cancer patients that I went to, every relative I ever spoke to. I thought that, if I kept talking, I would eventually say something that made sense. The messages that I was picking up from pro-life, purity culture sources were affecting me in other ways, too- I was completely lost in fantasies of my ""prince"", still looking for him in almost every boy that spoke to me. I desperately wanted real life to be a story that I could control, which was the same reason I kept searching for ""closure"" for my older siblings. I always told myself that this article, this conversation, this poem would finally allow me to move on with my life. But this was real life, not the story I wanted it to be, and there was no such thing as closure.

My mom died at the end of that year. The second thing I said after getting the news was, “she died thinking I hated her”. Two weeks later, my fundamentalist Christian cousin took me to an event for ""women's organizations"", including a crisis pregnancy center. I asked her if she thought women who had abortions went to Hell, and she said that those who repented were saved. My mother had not ""repented"". I could not accept that answer, so I shut down. Was I pro-life? Was I pro-choice? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I was full of guilt.

Trump was elected the year after that. I, like so many others, was terrified. I thought that 14 year old me might get her wish to see abortion made illegal- potentially at the expense of a future me. I wondered about getting on birth control while it was still accessible, even though I was still the virginest virgin that ever virgined. At this point, my peers were starting to have sex, and I started to resent my virginity even as I clung to it. I still heard the voices of my bullies in my head- ""well, obviously you're still a virgin, who would want to have sex with you?"" I'd had a boyfriend, but I wasn't actually attracted to him, so there'd been no need to worry about breaking my ""pledge""- I had reluctantly gone with him because I wanted the validation of someone desiring me. I wanted to lose my virginity for the same reason- although I mostly fantasized about being in passionate love with someone, part of me would have taken a hookup to be like the ""cool kids"". But I was unable to pursue either one, because of fear- fear that my bullies had been right and no one would want me, and fear that if I did successfully get what I so craved, I would end up repeating my mother's and aunt's mistakes. I looked forward to college, and the crazy party culture there, believing that there I would be freed from my limitations and could ""make up"" for all the social opportunities that I had missed earlier in life. Still, I put on the same prudish front that I had been putting on my entire life, especially for my family- I needed to, in order to separate myself from my now-dead mother that they were searching for a replacement for. 

I realized the futility of this the year after that, when, on our way to tour a college, my uncle showed me an article about college hookup culture and impressed upon me that getting pregnant would ruin my life. He told me the story of what had happened to my mother, as if I didn't already know. It was then that I realized that, in spite of me saying things like ""if you don't want a baby, don't have sex"" for years, I still could not separate myself from my mother. Then what the hell had I gone through all of that shame and alienation and emotional turmoil for? I asked myself that question into my senior year, when I found out that the guy I’d longed for when I was a chastity-pledging 14 year old looking for my ""prince"" had slept with seemingly everyone but me. All anyone could talk about was all the parties I hadn't been invited to and all the sex I hadn't been having. I was locked into being the weird, boring girl that people kept around for entertainment and to cheat off on tests. I resented everyone who had put me in this position- mostly myself, but even my older siblings, piles of biomedical waste that they were, were not exempt- although they obviously were incapable of doing anything, I could resent the conceptions of them I had created in my head for daring to exist. Now I was left holding a ton of baggage that I didn't want, with no way to put it down. That was, until I got to college. I got into my dream school and believed that the narrative of my life had finally come to a happy resolution. There was more pain to come- I ended up not going to prom because I was betrayed by my ""friends'' yet again- but, even as I continued to suffer, I desperately held onto the hope that it would all beq vindicated in college.

I went to college the year after that- angry, desperate, and prepared to do a complete 180. Like with high school, I made a lot of superficial connections at first (via our class group chat), but the mask fell almost as soon as I actually got to campus. College party culture puts all of one's insecurities under a microscope, and I wasn't the slightest bit equipped to deal with it. Often I didn't even really want to be out, but I needed the validation of finally getting to party after everything that had happened in high school. I wanted to hook up with someone- again, for validation- but no one approached me in those first few weeks. ""LOL, you're too ugly to get laid even in college!"" blared in my head so loudly that it was impossible to think clearly- I did and said and thought so many stupid and unethical and even dangerous things, out of utter desperation for someone, anyone, to find me attractive. I was entirely caught up in narrativizing my life- I walked around campus listening to songs from Broadway musicals, rewriting them into a ""musical"" about my college life. Most of these writings featured my mother and/or my older siblings as ghosts, either helping or hindering my journey. It's hard to overstate how omnipresent they were in my mind. My mom's first abortion was when she was a freshman in college, right before she dropped out and started over. That story existed in every failed midterm, every guy that felt me up in a frat house basement. The first time I blacked out, I went into hysterics about my mother, crying ""she killed my sister!"" The second time, I almost left a party with a guy I'd just met, a few days after I had a philosophy lesson on abortion that perfectly explained the pro-choice position and ""freed"" me from the (ideological, at least) burdens of four years past. Still, even while he was kissing me, I imagined my older siblings desperately trying to stop me from making the same mistake that created them. It was only because of my best friend intervening that I, a virgin who had been ""saving myself"" just four years earlier, didn't bang a stranger that night. I tried to get on birth control after that, afraid that this was the beginning of a pattern, but was so bad at being on time to things that I missed several appointments. My life was falling apart at this point- I was not doing my assignments, binge drinking whenever I had the chance, and physically ill with symptoms similar to those my mom had before her diagnosis. My two best friends were also mentally ill and making poor life decisions; we reveled in it. One of them, like my mother, had absolutely no sexual boundaries; like my mother, he was entitled, had no respect for the word no, and was prone to fly into a rage if his ego was wounded. As the year went on, he got worse, she got more like him, and I became further and further alienated from them. I didn't want to be in this sordid downward spiral anymore, but I felt helpless to do anything about it. I figured that this was simply what my mother had said was going to happen, and that time was finally proving her right.

The year after that, I was betrayed by my ""friends"" yet again, as the downward spiral hit rock bottom. I was left with even more shame than I'd had before. If no longer being the prude I was in high school had gotten me into that hypersexual clown car of failing grades and poor decisions, then I would be that same prude forever, as long as I could be smart and sweet and safe again. I had lost my main social circle, and spent most of my time hiding in my room, but I was still narrativizing my life, and the narrative said that I would rush a sorority after getting off of academic probation and I would have a social life again. That was the only thing that kept me going that semester, but after I got off probation, things started to go off script. I had a panic attack on my 20th birthday, and cried the night before I was supposed to return to campus, not wanting to go back. I was beginning to realize that I had issues that could not be solved by a makeover or a semester of A's. Still, I rushed the sorority, but I suppose I wanted it too much- or my former friends had been spreading their lies about me. I was rejected and checked into the campus counseling center the next day. Within one month I was working with a trauma-informed therapist.

It was then that I began to learn. I learned that I was not uniquely broken, but that my ""brokenness"" was the result of generational trauma that had been present in my family long before I was born. I learned that I couldn't do assignments or be on time because of ADHD, had been unable to stop obsessing over abortion because of Pure-O OCD, and still heard the voices of my bullies in my head because of C-PTSD. I learned that a mother showing her 9 year old her sexual aids is a kind of child abuse called ""covert incest"", and that it was in no way the 9 year old's fault for not being ""good"". I learned that my brain-tumor-like symptoms were caused by ""conversion disorder"", brought on by the psychological pain of losing my mother. I learned that putting things in the vagina was not supposed to sting, and that that was called ""vaginismus"", a condition often seen in women who have trauma related to sex- I learned that last one when I finally went to the gynecologist ""to get over my discomfort with sexual things"" and the exam left me in searing pain. And I learned why I'd taken up the mantle of being a ""Sister of Angels'' all those years ago- I'd really meant ""Sister of a Living, Breathing Abused Autistic Boy"". My little brother, the one childhood playmate I could count on, was diagnosed at 3. He is nonverbal, so I was always the one speaking for him, which was where I learned to control and project onto others. Our mother had refused to accept his disability, and once she had, she'd abused him for it- and I had followed her lead. I had become her way to ""make up"" for him, to hide the fact that our family had ""something wrong"", which was why I had to prove myself by owning sparkly pink crap and wanting to be prom queen. I'd pined for my aborted siblings as though I didn't have a living one right in front of me, but really, being pro-life was a way to protect him. He, like my other siblings, was unwanted. It so easily could have been him in a biohazard bag- my mother once confessed that sometimes she wished this was the case. I felt terribly guilty being the only wanted one, and even I knew what it felt like to be unwanted, so I tried to protect the unwanted in the only way I knew how.

That said, I am not pro-life, and have not been for a very long time. As part of relinquishing my pathological need to control, I let go of my need to control others' medical decisions, especially since I know that I might make the same choice were I to end up in that situation. I used to associate being pro-choice with being sexually indiscriminate, which was why my response to finally finding a reason to be pro-choice was to almost sleep with a stranger, but now I know that ""women should have the right to an abortion"" (or even ""if I have an unwanted pregnancy I will abort"") and ""I only want to have sex with someone I trust"" are two statements that are not in any way mutually exclusive. I am confident now that both of those statements are my truth. Being pro-life would make sense in a perfect world- where rape and abuse never happen, where everyone has access to gainful employment and childcare, where many of these aborted fetuses would not have been born just to be dead children. I know that I do not live in a perfect world, and to be honest, I knew that at 14. I knew that every time I had to step over my mother lying on the floor because the tumor destroyed her balance and rush out the door to a school where the sight of my so-called ""friends"" made me want to throw up from fear. But I remained enveloped in a narrative- one where I controlled everything, but one where my relationships, my beliefs, my very thoughts were not real.

Then the pandemic hit, and I, like so many others, lost the world that I had lived in before. I was already struggling to do my assignments while also starting trauma recovery, but once everything moved online, I stopped going to class entirely and had another bomb-out semester. I decided to take a leave of absence; originally in the class of 2022, I will now graduate in 2024. Going on leave shattered any pretense of having a normal college experience, or of being normal at all- things had gone completely off script, and without a narrative to follow, I lost all hope. My grandmother became a statistic- one of almost 5 million and counting lives ended by the virus. It was only after her death that I realized the hold she'd had over me. The shame that had kept me silent about my period for half a year, the religious beliefs that had supplemented that shame and caused me so much fear, the fantasies of finding my ""prince"" that had soothed my longing heart for years- it was all tied up with her. I had constructed my worldview around her, and now that she was gone, I was again left holding baggage that I didn't want and couldn't put down. Part of me found other ways to hold onto said baggage; I fell into TERF communities online and became against porn, attempting to cease my own consumption of it just like I did as a 14 year old in purity culture but convincing myself that this was totally not the same thing. And part of me wanted to burn the entire suitcase, but I was afraid to- I was afraid that I would repeat the mistakes I'd made my freshman year of college, and more than anything, I didn't want to feel that unsafe again.

It was this year that I realized that, despite the pain of losing my grandmother and all she represented, I am free now. There are no more ideals of purity or perfection to live up to, no more scripts that I need life to follow. But freedom felt empty. I was left staring into the void that the losses of 2020 left behind, asking, what now? Only recently have I begun to construct a new hope. I'm starting to want to do things for myself again- eat healthy, care for my appearance, get rid of the tension I've been carrying in my body for almost 22 years. Once again I have an image of a future that I can look forward to, but unlike all those fairytale endings of the past that didn't pan out, this one is not based upon a narrative. Only by living, not narrativizing, will I finally encounter the people and things that are truly meant for me.

One of the things I lost in 2020, although the loss had been occurring slowly over a period of years, was my religion. My concept of God was always very close-minded, although I was not technically raised in the church. As a child, I accepted anything that claimed to be the word of God, because I was absolutely terrified of being disobedient. This, of course, primed me for purity culture to traumatize me. The older I got, and the smarter I became, the less those scare tactics worked on me. Like with everything else, in the absence of religion, there was an emptiness- does life have no meaning, do we just die and that's it? However, since I was a child, I have always been a very spiritual person, and that is something that I have retained in my construction of a new hope. Particularly of interest to me is the concept of reincarnation. Back when I was pro-life at 14, I read something that raised the idea of the souls of aborted babies coming back in the forms of later children. I realized that, if that is the case, then the lost sister that I was searching for was really me all along.",t2_13ih3u5d,1634438156,prochoice
Long term effects of the Texas abortion ban on Texas education,"While I am outraged about the Texas abortion ban and everything it's doing to harm women, I am even more concerned about the strain it will put on Texas public schools.

I am a teacher in the fastest growing school district in Texas. We are struggling to meet the needs of all students as we do not have the infrastructure, resources, or manpower to handle our current and future growth. Most of our students come from low income households, which will be the most harshly impacted by the abortion ban. Public schools often pick up the slack for parents when they are unable to meet certain needs for their children. As the abortion ban increases the number of students in poverty, resources for each child will begin to decrease. 

I have one class of 37 students in a classroom built for 25. I don't have enough chairs to seat everyone, so the students take turns sitting on the floor. We do not have enough bus drivers in our district, so bus drivers make two trips. They drop off one group of students, then return to the school for the second group of students. The lack of drivers means that many buses arrive late to school and some students miss breakfast. Many teachers, myself included, keep fruit snacks or granola bars to give to students who miss breakfast due to their bus arriving late. We also have a shortage of permanent and substitute teachers. Teachers are giving up their conference periods to substitute. This means that classes without a permanent teacher have a different sub every period. Needless to say, the students are learning very little. As we struggle to give each student the bare minimum, our population keeps expanding. The influx of children created by the abortion ban will put unnecessary strain on Texas' public schools, and the kids will be the ones who suffer. Personally, I believe that children deserve better, but I guess Texas lawmakers disagree.",t2_695xuk1c,1634424322,prochoice

The conviction attempts (and successes) of those who had natural pregnancy loss reveals a lot of truth,"After reading this article: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/16/policing-pregnancy-miscarriage-corporate-drug-pushers-go-free](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/16/policing-pregnancy-miscarriage-corporate-drug-pushers-go-free) I felt the need to point out some disturbing trends here.

* Brittney Poolaw - convicted of manslaughter for having used methamphetamines during pregnancy and them being found in the fetus's system. (Even though doctors cannot conclude this was the cause of death, that didn't stop them.
* Chelsea Cheyenne Becker - charged with murder for the very same thing
* Marshae Jones - charged with manslaughter for starting a fight that led to her being shot having a natural pregnancy loss
* Kim Blalock - prosecuted for taking a prescribed opiate painkiller while pregnant alleging that it was fraud because she failed to disclose her pregnancy to the prescribing doctor

So what's happening here?

They are all being charged based off behavior deemed wrong, ergo, behavior they are not entitled to be partaking in.

And those that are bringing the charges are going to be anti-abortion proponents - prochoice proponents aren't going to be pressing these kinds of charges.

And this is what is going on with the mentality behind views on abortion and views on sex: you aren't entitled to those things.

We see it in how they talk about sex and the push for abstinence only sex ed, waiting till you are married to have sex (cause you know, married couples don't need abortion too), the assumption that people are careless and not using protection, not having sex unless you are open to having kids, coming from indoctrination that refers to first time sex as ""losing one's innocence,"" so on, and so forth.

And when they talk about abortion, they are basically saying that an fetus is entitled to your body first and foremost, especially your uterus because ""that's what it's for,"" and you are not entitled to an empty uterus once it is occupied.

It's also a failure to acknowledge that consent to x is not consent to y. A failure to understand that if you consent to x, y happening to you doesn't become more okay.

The entire reason it is okay to kill someone in self defense is because they were trespassing on your rights. And you have a right to your own body. No one else does. That's it. Full stop. Once you understand and agree to this, it is not logical to then conclude that abortion bans are justified. 

The talk of ""right to life is the right to not be killed unjustified"" is just a smokescreen. If you understand that no one is entitled to your body, you understand that the ""justified"" part is met in that understanding and wouldn't view abortion as a violation of someone's RTL. (Not that I think a zef is it's own person - I don't.)

Abortion bans do not violate the rights of the fetus because they are entitled to their own bodies, not someone else's. Just because they die in abortion does not mean their rights were violated. Lots of people die in various manners where they could have been prevented, including after direct action is taken. Does not mean that their rights were violated.

It's really simple.

But these prosecutions show a similar trend: the belief that you are not entitled to your body.

This has everything to do with that belief first and foremost. And life comes secondary. Because if it came first, they would be all for ensuring born infants had rights to their parent's bodies in the form of tissue donation, once born, if they so needed it.",t2_6gi7y,1634409263,prochoice

Abortions due to gender: moral or not?,"I live in India where sex determination during pregnancy is banned due to how female fetuses tend to be aborted if they find them to be females.
But I really wonder if this law does more good than harm to the mother involved and the society.


In India there's a preference to male children for some patriarchal reason idk about.
What tends to happen due to this law is that couples keep having children until they have a male child. And the mother's health is adversely affected.

And it isn't like other non medical forms of Sex determination isn't still used. Couples go to religious leaders to determine if the child they're expecting is male or female and then abort if the priest says it is female.


I know it's wrong to abort based on gender but... Forcing couples to have kids of a gender they don't want still seems like a bad idea cause they end up neglecting (in terms of education, nutrition and respect) their female children who are born. 

I've heard of some North Indians, due to this law, straight up disposing newly born girl children. 


It makes me wonder if this law is doing more bad than good.

Killing another Human is only bad when it attack something that you personally value ( In my opinion),"This will be a long read and there is no tldr also this post is in the r/Abortiondebate

So one thing I been thinking about why killing another human is supposed to be a bad thing . The pro-Life always make the argument that either abortion is killing a human being or abortion is killing an innocent human being and some people on the Pro-Choice side respond to that by saying, what's wrong with killing a human. I am here to make the argument that the killing of a human being in general isn't wrong or a bad act.

So let's make a few thing clear

* first lets make the distinction between good and bad and right and wrong.
* second I wanna make it clear that for the sake of argument all killing of a human being regardless of context will be treated with the same weight

1. So the difference between good and bad and right and wrong, keep in my this is how I personally interpret the difference. So right and wrong are thing that are decided by how we as a society should see certain activity or acts. like forcing sex upon someone else against their will is a wrong act. Good and Bad while they can go together with right and wrong are determine by a persona moral code, what the individual see as acceptable and unacceptable. I'll use the example from the beginning. Some Pro-life people are fine with killing anther human as long as the human being killed isn't innocent while other pro-lifer aren't ok with killing a human in general innocent or not.
2. Now moving onto the second point, for the sake of the argument I am lumping all killing regardless of context in together so all killing have equal weight to them, So killing that would be consider an murder is now just homicide, A killing in self defense is now just homicide ect ect. my reasoning for doing this is because  

   1. To make thing simple
   2. Regardless of what the reason, when you kill a human being you are killing a human at the end of the day. yes it could be justified or an accident but the end result is a dead human
   3. A justified killing today might be Murder today or a murder killing in one place might be a justified killing in another state. I will use texas as an example. they banned abortion of 9/1/21 after 6 week. so if I wanted to have an abortion before the new law pass then it would be justified now that it pass, it's not justified but just because texas have an abortion ban don't mean other states have one, A women can still get an late term abortion in California. I think you get my point
   4. All killing of a human being at the very least start out as a homicide. it might become a more serious charged later but all killing are homicides

So with all of that out of the way, let's start with the first question. Is the act of 1 human killing another human wrong? Well I can't say for other culture but living in america I gotta say NO it's not wrong. we allow people to kill each other all the time or get away with it, Self Defense, Protect your castle, Police shooting, Military, Mental Illness, Assisted Suicide, Abortion ect ect. those are the reason why I can tell you that the act of killing another human is not wrong, even if we don't personally like it.

Now lets move onto the reason why you are all here the title, is killing another human bad? As someone who believe in morality being subject my first reaction is to say that it depend. so I been asking myself and looked around a little trying to figure out why killing another human is a bad thing and the answer I got is

1. Because Human life is valuable
2. Because the loss of human life hurt our economy
3. Because the loss of human life mean the loss of potential
4. To keep order in a society

* So let's start with the first one. So I got that listening to the Pro-Life side, Alot of member in the Pro-Life side like to try to reach your emotion and morality by saying that human life is valuable. However from my point of view at least for me personally that is not a good reason to why killing another human is bad. The way I see thing that alone is not enough reason to why we shouldn't kill another human. we have the death penalty and we give cops the ability to shoot and kill, I personally would take the life of anther human for many reason. Also I only see a handful of human worth a damn basically, for me personally if you are not one of those human that I care about then your life really mean nothing to me. I could sit there and watch you die because you are choking on something and I would feel little to no guilt about it. I wouldn't feel any need to value your life, if we have no connection and I know a lot of people feel the same way that I do. also there 7.9 billion humans in the world if one die then there will always be another
* 'Because the loss of human life hurt our economy' so this is probably the most logical argument against killing, I came to this realization after thinking about a human worth. so it's reported that a human life is worth 10 million dollars so the lost of 1 or 2 or 10 human life isn't gonna hurt the economy but losing around 500,000+ human life is really gonna hurt the economy. while this is the most logical reason and a good reason to why killing another human is bad, the problem with this is that this argument only work for people who really care about money or the economy. I like this argument cause it's the most logical one but this isn't a good reason for me to not kill another human because there are some human who life I do value and I would rather see a country burn to the ground then see those people get killed
* So when I try asking ' why is killing a human bad into google' I was taken to some link and skimming through those link form my understanding, killing a human isn't bad because it's a human life, it's bad because when you kill a human you are killing the potential the human have. while I do appropriate this because It's a nice change of pace from the ' human are inherently valuable' speech that people like to shove down your throat. For me personally I have to disagree with this because knowing how evil humans can be and looking through history of all the evil we done. I mean we build a freaking nuke just to kill as many people in 1 go as possible. Humanity potential is a good reason why we should just die off
* Last is the final reason to why killing another human is bad! this is the one I came up with and that is to keep order in our society. I think the purge series is a good example of a society that just let human kill each other. However maybe I am blind and can't see it but I don't know how this can be use against abortion since the way we have it set up. if a women wants an abortion of her own choice she can get one. yeah it's not perfect but abortion isn't destroying our society, people aren't just randomly killing people or committing crimes.

So those are the reason that I was able to get to the question 'why killing another human is bad' and looking over all of this and thinking about it, I finally came to a answer. Killing is only bad when it attack something that you as a person value. I will use me as an example, there are a few thing that I value, my love one are one of those thing so any killing that take them away I am against, however the killing of anyone else I am willing to over look it assuming that the killing itself don't attack one of my value or belief then I am honestly indifferent to it and I believe that a lot of people are the same.

"People choose abortion because they don’t want to be pregnant, not necessarily because they don’t want to be parents.","I’ve been seeing this a lot lately, and it kind of pisses me off. People from both Pro Choice and Pro Life seem to have this misconception that people choose abortion because they’re don’t have the time or money to raise a kid. Or because it’s difficult and just something they don’t want to do. While people may cite this as a reason, that’s not *actually* it. Otherwise, adoption would fix both of those problems. You don’t have to raise the kid, nor do you have to pay to support them. From the moment it leaves your womb, it’s no longer your problem. 

So clearly, that’s not why people choose abortion. It’s because, poverty and life circumstances aside, pregnancy is *still* incredibly harmful. Carrying a ZEF to term will permanently damage your body, or potentially even kill you. People choose abortion because they don’t want to go through *that*. Not necessarily because they don’t wanted be parents. 

As a disclaimer, of course there are other reasons besides those someone may want an abortion. I’m not addressing those.

I’m bringing this up because even pro choice people imply that you can just fix the financial situation and end abortion. That can’t be done, and the implication is harmful to our movement. There is nothing on earth that would convince me to carry a pregnancy. I’m tokophobic, and just the thought of getting pregnant repulses me to my core. If it happened, I would choose suicide or abortion.  And my choice is valid. 

That, or this argument it’s used to attack PL for being hypocritical— how can they force people to give birth without acknowledging the immense cost and effort it would take to raise a kid?

This is a bad argument. Straight up. You know why? Because all it takes to refute it is finding a PL that supports adoption services, maternity/paternity leave, social safety nets for the poor, Medicare for all, etc. This argument from hypocrisy crumbles if you try to use it against someone who isn’t hypocritical.

Has anyone heard of Lauren Chen? My thoughts on her,"Since she is a public figure, and as per her own words, she is a 'reporter'. She has claimed that she has told the border services that she is a reporter, and that's why she traveled between USA and Canada. So I think talking about her is fair game. Now that's out of the way...

Even disregarding her as a person, I want to talk about her points. I will try finding her older video, but in another video, she has sarcastically remarked that being pro life does not mean supporting every single child from birth to 18.

Yet she comes up with this. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6vdAmw-BZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6vdAmw-BZY)

In summary, she has said that 'we need to talk about why people aren't having as many kids'. Hypocrisy is worse than simply being a 'pro lifer'. She has stated she isn't responsible for people's kids but then at the same time acts like she should get into people's business. So which is it?

But what I want to highlight is these people are not 'pro life'. In this context, it's obvious her points are pro birth. She is literally pushing for people to have more kids. 

What are your thoughts? Do you guys think a declining birth rate is a problem that we should 'encourage people to do'? I really just can't agree with this. Declining birth rate? So be it. It's our choice. And the point about being financially unable to care for a kid. Like yes, finances kind of is part of the deal. I have the choice. I'd rather ensure my kid is healthy. The people she mentioned having kids despite financial hardships generally do not have a choice.",t2_mztn6r8,1634235977,prochoice

don't that last part go against what the pro life believe, using birth control to stop pregnancy from occurring ? 

So greg abbott the governor of Texas who is Pro-Life or lean more toward that to my knowledge had

1. Allow for a law to let civilian to spy on other people (mainly women) and take the law into their own had. Which is something I don't get why no one period is making a big deal of that, cause isn't the whole point of law enforcement is to have people train by the state to do this kinda stuff so regular civilian don't end up hurting themselves or other. 
2. Banned abortion up to 6 weeks with no exception for rape or incest and I will admit that I have not read the law so if you wanted to tell me that the bill make no exception for the mother life, I wouldn't be shock. 
3. Banned Mail in abortion pill which I would love to know how they will banned that, because couldn't a women have someone from the next state over have a friend send her the pill and she share those with other women ? 
4. Banned at least 1 type of Birth Control and I am honestly waiting for him to banned condoms or other birth control
5. and ensure the ban on abortion is secure in the state of Texas, which basically mean he just won the culture war so now let see how he will get his base to vote for him

* So what his he doing to at the very least stop unwanted pregnancy from happening ?
   * well to my knowledge nothing
* What his he doing to stop Men from raping women ?
   * well I am sure he propose the death penalty for rapist other then that nothing ?
* Also I do wanna point out that this is the same guy who sign a banned on mask and his state have one of the most covid death out of all the 50 states

Again to be fair to Greg Abbott I haven't been keeping up with Texas politics honestly it's too depression so maybe he did do more to stop rape and to stop unwanted pregnancy, tho coming from the guy that just banned a type of birth control I highly doubt it, but I am willing to admit that I could be wrong on this one but I really doubt it.

And to that 1 pro life person that gonna see this post on this sub and post it on the pro life sub with a title saying

 'lol look at this idiot, Assuming all pro life people are ok with Greg Abbott policy, typical Pro baby killer'  

Ok fine Greg Abbott don't represent all Pro Lifer, but he dose Represent all Pro Lifers in Texas, and Greg Abbott is not pro life, he is clearly a Pro Birth that just wanna control women and use them to make new babies to replace the people that where killed by covid because he refuse to protect them from it and so are all the ""Pro Lifer"" in the state of Texas rather you support his policy or not and there is nothing you can do to change my mind about that until he is voted out of office.  

and if you are a ""pro lifer"" in Texas that have a problem with anything I just said then what are you waiting for, I am right here but I know most of you won't do Sh!t, this is what gonna happened, you are gonna see this post get mad type out some variation of how 'I am an idiot' and then forget about this post.",t2_4peg9a81,1634209784,prochoice

"Abortion advocacy would be far more effective if it focused on the physical and mental damage pregnancy can cause, and here's why","If anything can be said for forced-birth activists, they are good at getting people on their side. They have a major advantage in that humans are predisposed to feel more protective of children, and they use this to maximum capacity. So to even have a chance against the rhetoric about savagely murdered children, and the graphic images, we need to use every hard-hitting truth about how pregnancy impacts women's bodies.

Someone on Twitter suggested taking the movement in this direction, with the emphasis that this harm is being done to women against their will. They were shot down by a well-known pro-choice ob/gyn, whose name I am not giving to avoid drama. 

User (in reply to comment about abortion being healthcare): Abortion is healthcare because pregnancy and birth hurt women. They cause physical harm and can be psychologically traumatic, especially if they are forced. Why are these facts not at the center of the conversation about reproductive rights?

Ob/gyn: Oh now you have ""obvious"" answers? I don't think I trust your discourse.

User: Speaking the obvious truth is the obvious answer.

In desperate times, as we all claim to be willing to do anything necessary to protect women, I wonder why this strategy is off-limits. Yes, there is information available online about genital tearing, pre-eclampsia, hemorrhage, and so on. But it receives little direct attention within most of the pro-choice movement. Prominent advocacy groups such as NARAL and even Planned Parenthood say over and over that abortion is medical care, without explicitly explaining why. In bringing it up with other pro-choice people in spaces outside this one, I've encountered similar hostility as in the exchange above.

Given that anti-abortion activists are unlikely to do their own research, it is our job to be as frank as possible about pregnancy's risks, from the everyday such as torn vaginal flesh, to death, to PTSD from the pain or loss of control over one's body during birth. These conversations need to happen everywhere reproductive activism does. In fact, I believe they should be a standard part of sexual education.

But we are not fighting only to dissuade activists from blocking abortion; women have the right to be informed of what pregnancy can do to them. Not just adult women considering pregnancy and capable of doing their research, but teenagers who become pregnant and are told by adults they trust that carrying to term is perfectly safe. Women raised to believe they're obligated to have children and that God will make it all okay. Women taught to ""just choose kindness,"" to put their needs last, thinking they are ""doing the right thing"" by deciding to carry to term. People who end up at crisis pregnancy centers and believe what they're told, not knowing they're being preyed on. 

If reproductive damages were an ongoing discussion like other issues such as neurodivergence or abusive relationships, so many women could be helped to make the fully informed decision about their pregnancy that is best for them, whichever that may be, while the public are pushed to see that the consequence of blocking abortion is not ""life,"" it is brutal and gender-based violence.",t2_89mlri23,1634184759,prochoice

1. If a woman who was in poverty miscarried, would she feel sadness or relelif? 

2. If getting an abortion is one of the hardest and most painful decisions for a woman to make, why do the majoirty of woman surveyed say years after getting an abortion their main emotion towards it is releif? 

3. Are you sure Men should have no opinion about Abortion? Even if they're pro-choice, they're opinion doesn't matter? Wouldn't you lose a ton of support for your cause?  

4. If Abortion really is one of the hardest ans most painful decisions a woman could ever make, then do they resort to Abortion for many reasons on a spectrum of seriousness? 

5. Why should average people and pro-lifers care about a woman's access to Abortion if it is not for a serious or neccesarey reason? I once heard of a 17 year old who got an abortion because she didn't want to look pregnant in a prom photo. 

6. Why does the mothers health and well being matter more then her babies? Shouldn't she be trying to protect her baby? Wouldn't parents die for their children? 

7. If Abortion is no elses buissness except a woman's and her doctor, then why do pro-chociers constantly want us to care about a woman's abillity to get an abortion, forcing us to have an opinion? 

8. If a fetus is a parasite, what kind of parasite is it? Typically, a parasite does not beneift it's host in any way, but a fetus is a woman's baby. It would be extremley important if a woman did not feel like she has to get an abortion. 

9. Are you sure Chirstians are trying to force their beleifs on you? If they were forcing their beleifs on you, they would force you to accept and practice Chirstianity. There have been historical cases of people forcing their religious beleifs on others. But how is this an example? 

10. Why should no one except the woman and her doctor have a say in an abortion? What about her freinds and family? Isn't a very difficult and painful choice for her? Why can't she have support from anyone? Except maybe some people on the internet? If a couple has a pregnancy, shouldn't this very difficult and painful process be a last resort before you have discussed with your freinds and family? Why would you choose to shut out your family, freinds, and support systems like that? Every situation must be different, so why should we all agree with this beleif that a woman should shut everyone out of her life before getting an abortion and we should have faith and feel good about the doctors performing abortions, total strangers you'll meet once who don't know the first thing about your family. 

11. Why don't all Hospitals have Abortions as a Medical Procedure? Isn't that kind of strange? Isn't Abortion healthcare? And yet such an important and neccesarey medical procedure is not performed at any hospitals? 

12. What are Abortionsit's Credentials? What else are these doctors quallifed to do? What Medical schools do they go to? 

13. Wouldn't be traumatic if a woman's baby fell out of her vagina when she on the toliet? Some Abortion Procedures are like this. I heard an Audio Recording of an Abortionist giving a woman instructions on how to abort her baby by sitting on a toliet and waiting for it go fall out of her vagina. And the woman seemed completley fine and calm. 

14. Are you sure pro-lifers just want to control woman? How so? By preventing them from making their own, life chocies? But how are they directly trying to control woman's movements and lifestyles? They to seem to only care about shutting down Abortion Clinics and banning Abortion. 

15. Do you think a fetus having Down Syndrome is a good enough reason for a woman to get an Abortion? 

16. Why do pro-choice woman see Abortion bans and restrictions as attacks on their bodies and reproductive systems? When some woman probably couldn't even imagine being a situation that would lead them to getting an abortion. Why is abortion such a big part of womanhood to pro-choice woman? 

17. If a baby wasn't aborted, how do you know it would have a terrible life? What about the virtue of staying positive and getting through life? Why do you jump ahead so much? And you haven't even been anywhere close to being a situation where an Abortion is neccesarey or apropriate? If it grew up in poverty, he or she would probably turn out fine. How is the babies well being in any danger unless your family was in danger of starvation or dissease? 

18. Pro-choicers always ask pro-lifers what they are doing to eliminate poverty and the foster care system. But what are pro-choicers doing? Shouldn't they have even more of a reason to care? If they are so concerned about all the woman in the world who can't get abortions? 

19. And the last question, when do you think life begins? 

Thank you all for your thoughts and replies! I appreciate it!",t2_7of51t8i,1634154734,prochoice
My Experience On The Pro-Life Sub,"This is purely for opening the discussion to both sides. If anyone is interested in my post here's the link:  [What Are Your Guy's Stance On Education and Championing Contraception](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/q6vh1v/what_are_your_guys_stance_on_education_and/)

TLDR; It would be great if both sides could unite under the idea of having safe sex and actually form organizations that would help pay for things such as diapers, medicine, food, shelter, for the unprivileged. There could be facilities in place where abstinence-only education is banned and teenagers realize there are consequences of having sex. My focus was not on abortion, but on asking what can pro-life people do to help those who chose to keep their kids or were barred from having an abortion.

I included some images of comments the post received. I noticed a lot were religious and didn't believe in contraception if they were. There was a lack of contraception education. Many thought it was only used to prevent pregnancy when in reality it's used to treat a variety of women's health issues. I think only one person engaged with the actual topic of the discussion, ""what can pro-life people do to help those who chose to keep their kids or were barred from having an abortion."" Many avoided it and brought it back to the, ""what does this have to do with killing kids""?

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1633939222,prochoice

I don't know why youtube showed me this, but I think it's actually a good thing. To know what exactly the fuck people are thinking.

Of course people like him will just say 'well you are just defective then'. Ok, so what, even if that's true. Leave me alone. My body, my choice. I never want to get pregnant.

The embryo relies on *everything* from its mother... including knowing whether it should have human rights or not,"If you saw an embryo side by side with an embryo of another species, you couldn't tell it apart from another embryo.

There are two ways you tell embryos apart:

* Knowledge of the species in which it resides 
* Sequencing its genome through biopsy in a lab

""An embryo is an individual human being.""

This is often spouted by prolifers in defense of needing to treat the zef as an individual with individual human rights from the moment of conception.

Except you don't even know it's human if not for the pregnant person also being human. You identify it by way of her. 

The problem is you aren't actually identifying it as an individual based off the zef's own qualities and merits. You are basing it off of the pregnant person that it is attached to. You are giving them their identification as human because of her, and thus, its human rights come to it *through her.* 

If you didn't have knowledge of the species in which belongs, it would mean it was detached from its mother. Here, it would require identification via genome sequencing, which would mean it is actually relying on its *own individual merits.* If you did not have the marker that is another human being to tell you that a particular embryo is human, then you would be dealing with an *actual* individual because it would have been detached and removed from the pregnant person.

It is at this time that one can treat the embryo as an individual. Because here, it actually is. 

I love how the humanity of women and afab is used against them to deny them their rights.

Additionally, if we are going to treat an embryo as its own individual rather than seeing the pregnant person as a see through glass lens used to further discredit regard for her own humanity, we need to treat it as an individual in all manner. As in, expecting it to maintain its own homeostasis.

I wrote about that elsewhere though; you can read about that further on my blog entry [here](https://philosophyinutero.blogspot.com/2021/03/discussing-gestation-how-zef-is-not.html).

""I'm pro choice, but the more prevalent Abortion is means that birth control is less prevalent, and in an ideal world more birth control would mean less abortions and if everyone could use way more types of birth control, and if it was more accessible, then more choice would exist for everyone."" 

""If anyone could get birth control for free of charge or flip a switch and block their fallopian tubes or their vas deferens for as long as they choose too then that would lead to fewer procedures like abortion and that's a good thing.""

"Realizations after ""discussing"" abortion with pro life individuals.","After discussing abortion with pro life individuals both on Reddit and offline, I have come to the realization that many of these individuals think they are defending the unborn by engaging in conversation and submitting their ballot.  

Because of this feeling of righteousness they have, their positions will always be inconsistent and up for change as long as it supports the PL position. Meaning, they do not use evidence to form an opinion, but instead start with their stance and gather evidence to support it. 

Often they hold contradictory stances - such as Catholics saying their faith does not mean they want to ban birth control, but somehow it is not inconsistent to ban abortion because of those beliefs. 

Similarly, they will say they support women after birth, but when confronted with real world scenarios they are quick to come up with reasons to not support that specific woman. They always did something that disqualifies them. Maybe they didn't get married... They chose to have sex.. they are a disfunctional family... Etc. 

This is dangerous because they set themselves up for easy manipulation. All someone has to do is give them an easy avenue to feel good about themselves and they win this person over. 

Their goals are not to reduce abortions, a goal they could share with many pro choice people here. Many of us realize abortion is not a great thing for a woman to go through, because many of us either had an abortion or shared a room with someone after they had an abortion and were in emotional and physical pain. 

However, when confronted with the fact that Roe has been law for fifty years, they insist that the best avenue for reducing abortions is abolition. Even when confronted with facts that countries with the lowest abortion rates often have the most liberal laws, they will be quick to discredit the source because it is more convenient for them to just chase after abolition rather than make meaningful change for women by supporting proper sex education, birth control availability, and strong social nets to care for women. It is a hard thing to fight for women. It is easy to donate to and support conservatives. 


The conversations that convince me the most of this motivation behind the PL crowd is the personal responsibility argument. They want to frame the woman as being in the wrong, so that they can feel good about denying her care. They are someone who made a mistake and should face the consequences of that mistake. This feeds directly back into their own emotions and knowing they are holding women accountable for having sex gives them positive emotional feedback. 

The outcome is, you will not win out with these people by discussing abortion. No matter how sincere you are, because they aren't arguing about abortion. They have a drug that makes them feel good, that drug is denying women care and holding them accountable (or even just the thought of it) and you can't argue with that position.

Abortion: Should you be Pro-Life or Pro-Choice? A defense of Abortion and why it should be Legalized and De-Stigmatized.,"I give free rein to anyone who wants to repost or use the arguments in this post. Just make sure to credit me.

Note: I have posted this on other communities, with the contents of this post edited and changed over time. Also, a while back, I have posted this exact post on this subreddit. My post has unfortunately been deleted due to it being mistaken for spam. I am reposting this under a different account. 

And if you're Pro-Life, I ask of you to read this post and my arguments de-criminalizing and destigmatizing abortion, for I have read yours demonizing and criminalizing it. You might not agree, but please, be nice.

1. (You’re killing children/humans)

No I’m not. Murder, by definition, is the purpose full ending/killing of a human life. The killing of a person. The fetus is neither. The thing that makes a human a human is sentience. The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without cognitive abilities, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings.

A fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of self. A fetus is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus is NOT OUTSIDE a woman's body and cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell. A fetus is NOT OUTSIDE a woman's body and cannot survive as it's own being.

A baby can. Therefore stabbing a baby is illegal even though it isn't exactly sentient, as it IS OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as it's own being. A fetus has neither sentience, nor the ability to BE OUTSIDE a woman's body and live as it's own being. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable without a capable host that is a woman’s body, when it is NOT OUTSIDE A WOMAN'S BODY AND cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It's not murder as the fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. It's not murder if a woman decides to abort the fetus in HER BODY. It’s called bodily autonomy. And as such, the argument that a fetus is human so abortion is murder and should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic.

And even IF fetuses were sentient, women still have the right to their bodily autonomy to abort the fetus. If I get in a car accident, and my twin sister was the only one whose blood was compatible with mine, I cannot FORCE her to donate blood. Doesn't matter if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe and painless procedure. Even if it was to save MY life. A fully sentient person with the ability to think and feel. Her right to her bodily autonomy trumps my right to live. If she doesn't want to give up a small part of her body-her blood- to save my life, it's perfectly legal for her to do so. Then why should it be illegal for a woman to not want to give up her body for 9 months through abortion? It isn't murder, it's bodily autonomy. The fetus is in MY body, and if I don't want it there, it's perfectly legal for me to remove it. The blood is in my sisters body, and if she doesn't want to give me HER blood, it's legal for her to do so. If I don't want a fully sentient individual in my body, giving me health problems, I have every right to remove it, even if it dies. If my sister doesn't want to donate her blood, she has every right to do so, even if I'll die.

And if you're going to say that every fertilized egg counts for an individual sentient human being, and therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm fertilized an egg didn't become a sentient human being? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding. You literally don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, if that’s what you believe, you should start a petition to ban hysterectomies, as the sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg attaches itself the the uterus, if a woman has no uterus, then the fertilized egg passes through her. But sterilization isn’t banned. Why not? Why are people against abortion?

Why are people against the removal of a fertilized egg from the uterus? Why is it only when it’s attached to the body part of a woman, in a woman’s body, sucking and taking nutrients from the woman, that people are against the removal of it? Sexism is terrible and it ruins the lives of women every day. As a man, you might have the benefit of not noticing. Of not needing to care. But for millions of women every day, they don’t have that privilege.

2. (All life is important/precious/…) (Life begins at conception)

So to be clear, you mean that all human life is important/precious, and you believe that a fetus/fertilised egg is a human. Well, a fetus/fertilised egg isn’t human. What counts as a human life, and what makes a living thing human, is sentience. \*cue my previous argument\* The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without a brain, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings. A fetus/fertilised egg isn't human as it has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of self. A fetus/fetilised egg is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell, outside of a woman’s body. A fetus/fertilised egg cannot survive on its own, as its own being. A baby/child can survive outside a woman’s body, on its own, as its own being.

So calling a fetus/fertilised egg a human life dehumanizing towards actual humans with fully formed brains and sentience, the ability to think and feel, survive outside of a woman’s body and the awareness of self. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable outside of a woman’s body, when it cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. CELL LIFE begins at conception. HUMAN LIFE begins after birth. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It’s called bodily autonomy.

And like I said before, if you're going to say that every fertilized egg counts for an individual sentient human being, and therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm fertilized an egg didn't become a sentient human being? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding. You literally don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, if that’s what you believe, you should start a petition to ban hysterectomies, as the sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg attaches itself the the uterus, if a woman has no uterus, then the fertilized egg passes through her. But sterilization isn’t banned. Why not? Why are people against abortion?

Why are people against the removal of a fertilized egg from the uterus? Why is it only when it’s attached to the body part of a woman, in a woman’s body, sucking and taking nutrients from the woman, that people are against the removal of it? Sexism is terrible and it ruins the lives of women every day. As a man, you might have the benefit of not noticing. Of not needing to care. But for millions of women every day, they don’t have that privilege .

And even IF a fertilised egg/fetus was sentient, (which it most certainly is not) women still have the right to their bodily autonomy to abort the fetus. If I get in a car accident, and my twin sister was the only one whose blood was compatible with mine, I cannot FORCE her to donate blood. Doesn't matter if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe and painless procedure. Even if it was to save MY life. A fully sentient person with the ability to think and feel. Her right to her bodily autonomy trumps my right to live. If she doesn't want to give up a small part of her body-her blood- to save my life, it's perfectly legal for her to do so. Then why should it be illegal for a woman to not want to give up her body for 9 months through abortion? It isn't murder, it's bodily autonomy. The fetus is in MY body, and if I don't want it there, it's perfectly legal for me to remove it. If the fetus cannot survive outside a host body, on it's own, as it's own being, it is perfectly legal for me to exercise my bodily autonomy and remove it from my body. The blood is in my sisters body, and if she doesn't want to give me HER blood, it's legal for her to do so. If I don't want a fully sentient individual in my body, giving me health problems, I have every right to remove it, even if it dies. If my sister doesn't want to donate her blood, she has every right to do so, even if I'll die. Please read my argument no. 4.

And as such, the argument that a fetus/fertilized is human so abortion should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic. Your beliefs, however much you think is just, do not supersede a woman's right to her bodily autonomy

3. ( But it’s against God/ It’s unholy)

So? Which God? Your god? Well, you do realize there’s a reason why the bible, or any religious scripture, isn’t used as laws and policies in the Government right? Just because something’s holy doesn’t mean it’s ethical, legal, or morally right. And just because something’s unholy doesn’t mean it’s unethical, illegal or amoral. Holiness isn’t a judge for morality. I could sacrifice a virgin or kill my firstborn son because God told me to, and that would be holy, but it wouldn’t be ethically, morally or legally right. You can have religion. You shouldn’t use religion to take away the freedom, free will and bodily autonomy of others. And besides, if your God is against bodily autonomy, free will, and promotes the oppression of women and anyone who doesn't follow him(lower case “h” on purpose) then maybe you shouldn’t follow him. After all, “Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and you will have made the world a better place.” I will say this again, don’t use your religious beliefs to take away the bodily autonomy and free will of others, particularly women in this case. Just because it’s a religious belief does not mean it’s morally ethically or legally right. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

4. (My body My Choice only makes sense if someone else’s life isn’t at stake)

“Someone’s life” First of all, let’s get the semantics right. A fetus isn’t someONE. It isn’t a human being. How do I know that? Because it doesn’t have sentience and it isn’t viable without a capable host. It cannot survive on its own, without sucking the nutrients of the host, without needing the host to build it’s every cell, and it cannot survive outside of the host, that is the woman. It cannot survive on it's own, outside of the woman's body, as it's own being.

We can legally pull the plug on brain dead people because they don’t have any cognitive ability. They don’t think and they don’t feel. And on top of that, they cannot survive without a life support system. A fetus can’t think or feel and it doesn’t have sentience. A fetus is not yet viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive without sucking the woman’s nutrients, without her building it’s every cell, without being attached to her uterus, without taking up space in her body, without squishing her organs, and it cannot survive outside a woman’s body. A human can survive outside a woman’s body and has sentience.

And Fun Fact, if my mother was in a car accident and desperately needed a blood transfusion to live… and I was the only person on Earth who could donate blood to save her, and even if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe, and quick procedure, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO GIVE BLOOD. Yes, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate blood if I don’t want to. My bodily autonomy trumps a FULLY SENTIENT woman's right to live, and a fetus has neither sentience, nor the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being.

If my father needed a kidney transplant because he has kidney cancer on both his kidneys, and I was the only person on Earth with kidneys compatible with his, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY TO GIVE UP ONE OF MY KIDNEYS. Even if the chance of me dying is low, even if I have two kidneys and am under anesthesia and feel no pain during the operation, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate my kidney if I don’t want to. Yet in some countries, it’s perfectly legal to force a woman with an unwanted pregnancy to go through labor-a painful, arduous and gratuitous experience where the woman is completely awake and has to push a 8 pound baby out of her vagina- for a clump of cells that don’t think, feel, have sentience or the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. See, we have this thing called “bodily autonomy”. It’s this cultural notion that a person’s control over their own body is above all important and must not be infringed upon.

We can’t even take LIFE SAVING organs from CORPSES unless the person the corpse once contained gave consent before their death. Even CORPSES have more bodily autonomy than women, and they aren’t even alive!

To tell people that they MUST sacrifice their bodily autonomy for 9 months against their will in an incredibly expensive, invasive, painful and difficult process to grow a clump of cells that have no brain, sentience, awareness of self or feelings, (in the earlier stages of pregnancy where the vast majority of pregnancies are performed) is desperately unethical. Also, women do not “carry babies.” They build every single cell of the fetus’s body. Women are not passive vessels unencumbered by pregnancy. The fetus that is not yet viable without a capable host does not supersede the bodily autonomy of a sentient woman. You can’t even ask corpses to sacrifice their bodily autonomy to give up organs that they aren’t using anymore as their dead.

You’re asking people who can become pregnant to accept less bodily autonomy than we grant to a literal corpse.

5. (You had sex and this is your punishment)

Who are you to decide what my punishment is? To decide whether I should even have one? Saying that pregnancy is a punishment for sex and that the baby the woman is forced to birth is her punishment is so dehumanizing. Why should a child grow up under the care of someone who is unfit to be a parent? Why must the child live out his/her life negatively affected by not being wanted? That the sole purpose for his/her existence is to punish his/her biological mother? That’s just plain cruel. You’re ruining the life of the child and the woman who was forced to give birth to it. Also, what does your argument have to do with anything? I think it might even be an argument for the legalization of abortion. Sex unprotected or not, isn’t unethical, amoral or illegal and therefore no punishment is necessary. The woman doesn’t deserve the punishment(having to give birth to a baby), the baby shouldn’t have to live out it’s life as a punishment and the woman can abort the non-sentient, non- self-aware fetus that is not yet viable without her body as it's host. Also, what you think is wrong does not supersede the woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. This is one of the flimsiest arguments I’ve ever heard.

6. a(You’re preventing someone from existing) b( What if your mom didn’t have you)

6a First of all, if you’re a woman, you’ll have millions of egg cells containing DNA, all with the potential of being fertilized. If you're a man, you have millions of sperm cells all with the potential of fertilizing. So according to your logic, if you don’t have millions of kids, you’re preventing millions of people from existing. Women who agree with this argument against abortion, please get pregnant at whatever age you start to menstruate and have a kid a year. Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, get knocked up each and every year of your life. If you start menstruating at 12, and die at 90, have at least 78 kids. But even then you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have all your eggs be fertilized. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! Men who agree with the argument against abortion, please get impregnate whomever and whoever you meet, even if they’re 11/12/13/14/15. Have sex unprotected with millions of women a year. Ensure they all get pregnant. Start doing that at 12.Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, knock up millions of women each year. According to your logic, if you don’t spend each and every moment of your time having unprotected sex, you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have each sperm you produce fertilize one egg that’s your bad. FYI, like I said, you have millions of sperm. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! \*end of me making fun of this argument\*.

You can’t biologically have millions of kids, you’re just not meant to. And you're not preventing anyone from existing if you have an abortion, because they don’t exist. How can you prevent someone from not existing, IF THEY DON’T EXIST? You have millions of egg cells in your ovaries. Are you going to be pregnant and in labor each and every year until you die? But even then there are still millions of egg cells left unfertilized. So according your logic, unless you live millions of years, you’re preventing the existence of millions of children. Doesn’t that just seem stupid? Besides, like I said, you can't prevent someone from existing if they don’t exist. Your incorrect beliefs do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

6b . First of all, if my mom chose not to biologically have kids, she wouldn’t be preventing my existence because I wouldn’t exist. And since she didn’t know it would be me, (I didn’t even know I’d be me) theoretically, the baby she gave birth to decades ago could have been anyone from the future president of China, to a homicidal maniac. Also, I didn’t exist for billions of years. \*I’m going to go on a bit of a rant now\*

I didn’t exist when I could die from simply going out of whatever shelter I lived in. I didn’t exist when the earliest settlers arrived in China, living in caves and hunting game, only to die from a little cut because antibiotics didn’t exist. I didn’t exist during various dynasties, when famine was always around the corner, poverty everywhere, and class differences huge. I didn’t exist during the 19th century when child labor was common place and even in Britain, child mortality rates where shockingly high. Also, people would taint milk with anything from lead to borax and you were lucky to have pond water in your milk. Also, I had pneumonia as a child and if I were born in the 19th and even 20th century, I would have died. I didn't exist during World War 1/2 and the NanKing massacre where millions of Chinese people died. I didn’t exist during The Great Famine when desperate people would resort to eating their dead in order to survive. I was born later on, with access to education, the internet and various luxuries like the air conditioner and an indoor bathroom. I am glad I didn’t exist for millions of years(even more if you’re counting the time before Homo Sapiens walked on the Earth). \*end of rant\*.

My point is, I was born. I didn’t feel the pain of not existing for millions/billions of years, because I didn’t exist. If my mom chose not to have kids, I would feel nothing because I wouldn't exist. I would thank her for her choice if I were even around to care. She wouldn’t be preventing my existence, because I wouldn’t fricking exist.

And therefore, you’re argument and weaponization of my mom is stupid. So those slogans that say “Your mom chose life, you should too” are stupid. Even if my mom didn’t choose to keep the non-sentient fetus not yet viable without sucking her nutrients and using her as it’s host, she wouldn’t be ending my life, because I didn’t exist. I wouldn’t even know because I wouldn’t be sentient enough to care. My mom chose to gestate and keep the fetus. It's her choice and her life. I chose to abort the fetus, it's my choice and my life.

As a fetus I was not conscious or aware of our existence, so if I was aborted I would never have known. My parent made the choice to gestate and give birth, that doesn't mean I have to do the same.

My mother's situation when she was pregnant was entirely different than my situation and my life, and it is ultimately irrelevant. I should not make the decision to have a child simply because I exist. I believe children should be wanted, and should not exist simply because of perceived obligation.

And also, even if she was preventing my existence by aborting the fetus, she isn’t ethically or morally wrong. It’s her body and it’s her choice. She has every right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

(You’re killing babies/ unborn child)

By saying “unborn child” you are insinuating that the fetus attached to the uterus of a woman, is in fact a child that has yet to be born. I am here to argue that you are wrong in that assumption/insinuation. This is quite similar to the argument that fetuses are human beings. Please read my argument above opposing that idea.

Let’s get our semantics right. An unborn child isn’t a child, it’s a fetus. A baby/child is someone who is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as it's own being, without taking up her uterus, sucking her nutrients and doesn’t need her to grow anymore. A fetus is a fetal embryo not viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive on its own, as its own being.

Whatever your beliefs, a non-sentient, non-feeling, fetus that cannot survive outside a willing host does not supersede that of the woman with it in her uterus. The fetus is in her body, and cannot survive outside of her uterus, as it's own being, unlike a baby. She has the bodily autonomy to decide whether or not to let it stay inside her uterus or abort it by removing it. Aborting a fetal embryo isn't killing a baby, because a fetus and a baby aren't the same. The woman can’t abort a baby that is born, because it’s out of her body and is no longer sucking up her nutrients, and she is no longer building every cell of it.

Think of it as a life support system. The fetus is essentially brain dead (no cognitive ability whatsoever) on a life support system that is the body of the woman, and she has every right to take it off its life support system that’s essentially her body. Once the fetus no longer needs the life support system to survive, and exits her body, she cannot take it off the life support system as it no longer needs it. She cannot stab it as it's OUTSIDE her body and can live AS IT'S OWN BEING. It’s the same with late term abortions. The fetus still doesn’t have any cognitive ability whatsoever, and is on a life support system that is the woman, and cannot live as it's own being. She can choose to take it off it’s life support system that’s her body.

What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body.

If it needs to be inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus, sucking HER nutrients, squishing HER organs and need HER to build every cell of its body, it is not a baby/child, it’s a fetus that is not yet viable without a host, inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus. And if she wants to abort it, if she doesn’t want to let it stay inside HER BODY, she has the bodily autonomy to abort it by medically removing it from HER uterus and HER body. The non-sentient non feeling and non-self aware fetus that is not yet viable without a willing host, does not supersede that of the woman with it in Her Body.

The removal of a non-sentient, non-thinking, non-feeling fetus that cannot survive on it's own, as it's own being outside it's host body - the woman-, isn't the killing of a baby, someone who doesn't have sentience, but can survive on it's own, outside the woman, as it's own being, it's the exercise of the woman's bodily autonomy. So anyone who chooses to abort a fetus is not killing a baby, because a fetus isn’t one. They are choosing to not let the fetus stay in their body, its host, not killing a baby. What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body. When it is not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body(uterus), it is a fetus and the woman has every right to choose to not let it remain in HER BODY. It’s called bodily autonomy. Once it’s out of her body, she cannot abort it, as it’s already out, and can survive without her body as its host.

She cannot stab it as it's outside HER BODY, and can survive as it's own being. This is a matter of bodily autonomy and women’s rights. The non sentient fetal embryo that cannot survive without its life support system, that's the woman, isn’t more important than a sentient woman with the ability to think and feel. How is it that some people still fail to grasp this very simple concept? Your misguided beliefs about what constitutes a fetus, a baby and a child do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

There’s also another brilliant argument. Here’s the link:[https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i\_dont\_care\_about\_the\_semantics/?utm\_source=amp&amp;utm\_medium=&amp;utm\_content=post\_body](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i_dont_care_about_the_semantics/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body)

my opinion on late term abortions:

I don’t get the controversy around late term abortions. The fetus still requires a host that is the woman, and the woman has every right to her bodily autonomy, and remove it from her body if she doesn’t want to play host. And it’s quite clear that people understand the difference between a fetus and a baby.

What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE the woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body.

If it needs to be inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus, sucking HER nutrients, squishing HER organs and need HER to build every cell of its body, it is not a baby/child, it’s a fetus that is not yet viable without a host, inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus. And if she wants to abort it, if she doesn’t want to let it stay inside HER BODY, she has the bodily autonomy to abort it by medically removing/aborting it from HER uterus and HER body, even if it's a late-term abortion. SINCE IT'S IN HER BODY, SHE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH/TO IT. EVEN IF THE LETHAL INJECTION IS NEEDED. It is NOT murder, please read argument number 1 and 4.

The non-sentient non feeling and non-self aware fetus does not supersede that of the woman with it in Her Body. CELL LIFE begins at conception, HUMAN LIFE begins after BIRTH.

If you had a petri dish with a fetus in one hand, and a baby in another, and you were forced to drop one, I think you would choose to drop the petri dish. She cannot abort a born baby, because it’s OUT of her body, and no longer needs her as it’s host to survive.

She cannot stab it, because it's out of HER BODY and can SURVIVE ON IT'S OWN, AS IT'S OWN BEING. This is a matter of bodily autonomy and women’s rights. The non sentient fetal embryo that cannot survive without its life support system, that's the woman, isn’t more important than a sentient woman with the ability to think and feel. I don’t know why people believe otherwise.

Just because you don’t like late term abortions/abortions doesn’t mean it’s ethically, morally or legally wrong. Just because you don't like it isn’t a good enough reason to restrict women’s right to their bodily autonomy. For example, I despise dogs. I know, a controversial opinion. I rather like cats. But just because I don’t like dogs doesn’t mean I have the right to restrict/prevent people from getting one. Your beliefs do not supersede a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

There’s also another brilliant argument. Here’s the link:[https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i\_dont\_care\_about\_the\_semantics/?utm\_source=amp&amp;utm\_medium=&amp;utm\_content=post\_body](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i_dont_care_about_the_semantics/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body)

(But...but a child was once a fetus)

Just because a child was once a fetus, doesn’t mean a fetus is the same as a child. Please read my argument above on why a fetus isn’t a child, and why it’s ethical to have an abortion. Please read argument number 6 where I argue that aborting a fetus doesn't mean you’re preventing the existence of a child. And I implore you, kind human, to read argument number 4 on why it’s doesn’t matter if abortions prevents the existence of a child. Your beliefs do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

Abortion should be legal and destigmatized. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

However happy you are from not aborting, however much you want children, doesn't mean you can take away another woman's right to her bodily autonomy-her right to abort the fetal embryo, her right to not play host to a fetus that isn't viable without her body.

Also, preventing someone from existing, (which you technically can't do), isn't the same as killing a person. Please read my argument no.6 to get an idea why.

If you have any of your own arguments or things to share, please do so in the comments section. I would love to discuss it with all of you.

I got the inspiration for some of my arguments from various posts, videos and articles.

I would welcome your opinions, responses to pro-life arguments and thoughts. And if you spot any grammatical errors, please inform me.",t2_exhqrjvp,1633776874,prochoice

There’s a surgeon through Planned Parenthood near me who is probably more willing to tie the tubes of someone my age. I shouldn’t need any other reason to tie my tubes other than not wanting kids, but I have medical and mental health reasons why it would be a bad idea to have them. I’m a grad student now and would like to get myself settled before going through the procedure, as it is an emotional thing to know you can’t have kids, even if you don’t want them.

The Solution to Sub 8,"Alright, so this nonsensical law that is an assault not only on women and pregnant persons’ bodily autonomy, but also the US rule of law is a complete fiasco. It takes away a defendant’s ability to recoup losses through counter-suit, and makes it impossible for a defendant to protect themselves from multiple suits. What’s more, because this is a civil court matter, anyone— even from outside of Texas can bring suit against any in any county in Texas, and there can be no change of venue unless agreed upon by the plaintiff. This bill was signed into law by the Governor of Texas Greg Abbott. 

So how do we make this horror show go away? Well, if I outlined how to do that in a step-by-step format, some asshole could substantiate that I was forming a conspiracy. It would be such a shame if several thousand citizens filed suits against Gov. Abbott in counties outside of the one Houston. He’d be on the hook for his own attorney fees, he can’t group them together, and just because he beats one doesn’t carry over to another. It would be a shame if Texas’ civil courts were suddenly clogged with this vigilante bullshit.

"I'm not pro-choice, I'm pro-abortion.","I've never been totally comfortable with the term ""pro-choice"" because it feels like it avoids saying abortion, and I don't think anti-abortion activists deserve the concession of thinking abortion is somehow shameful. I think this subreddit's icon is perfect, because the fact is, abortion bans put women's lives at risk. Abortions aren't going to stop because you ban them, they're just going to become extremely dangerous. Abortion bans are always a sign of putting religious institutions before human rights. It's a sign of authoritarianism. I don't completely understand why, so I should research more on gender politics, but authoritarian regimes always disempower and seek to control women, reducing them to their reproductive function, which is dehumanizing and fascistic.

I value individual rights on the level of sentience - the more something can think, the more rights it should have. Even if a fetus has rudimentary cognitive functions or a heartbeat, that places its value on the level of simple organisms with the same level of cognitive functioning. I think it's more humane to end that life than to bring it into a world where it's unwanted, it will condemn itself and its family to poverty, or it will have to endure great suffering. I would rather abort that barely functioning life, and give the mother the opportunity to become more educated or earn more, so she may give herself and any future children better lives.

Anti-abortion politics are always informed by religious fundamentalism, and allowing bronze age superstitions to inform public policy is medieval.",t2_dekepgwv,1633718336,prochoice

Historical Control of Women,"The biggest problem that I have with the prolife community is they don't seem to have an understanding of how historically messed up their opinions are. Forced sterilization of women is intrinsically tied to controlling women, and denying healthcare goes hand in hand with forced sterilization. 

Women, more specifically women of poverty and color, have been sterilized throughout history. Before feminism became ""mainstream"" it was the most practical way of control. Take away a women's place of having children took away her place in society, therefore a mechanism of control. 

Even in modern times there still exists female genital mutilation. (cutting off the clitoris, cutting up labia, sew the vagina shut) Take away pleasure from sex and insert pain you are able to prohibit women from having sex unless a man forces it. That's not to say that despite the pain, the woman might still want sex. This is another form of control, ensure that a young woman stays a virgin and can go to the 'highest bidder'. 

How does this relate to abortion rights? Its pretty simple, take away the safety in abortions and make them 'scary' (such as being sued for $10k, thanks Texas). Women will become scared of sex, and once again a woman's sexuality is being controlled.  Of course the argument to this could be abortion shouldn't be 'the backup plan'.  It's not that there to be the result of a pregnancy, it's existence as a safe procedure lets women know they don't need to be trapped and controlled. 

So when I say men should have to get vasectomies, I am drawing attention to the control. Women's healthcare or lack there of is how women have been controlled for centuries. I don't believe a vasectomy is the opposite of abortion. I don't even think theres a parallel between the medical procedures, but there is a parallel between the control.",t2_a1m9clej,1633712381,prochoice

The hypocrisy of the “pro life” agenda,"So I’m reading this book on Climate Change and in it they talk about these young activists in 2019 filing a legal complaint with the UN over a treaty violation. The treaty is called the ‘Convention on the Rights of a Child’. It says, among other things, that every child has the “right to life” and that governments “shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”
The activists argued that by not doing enough to prepare for climate change leaders have failed to protect children’s rights to life and health.
And low and behold, they mention how the United States hasn’t even SIGNED the treaty.
I mean, we all know the US produces some of the highest amounts of greenhouse gasses, and doesn’t have any plans to stop. But now with all these self righteous Republicans and their mission to ban abortion in the name of “saving unborn children’s lives” is all just bullshit. Considering how they refuse to take any steps to ensure a child’s right to health &amp; life when it’s literally presented to them on a silver platter.

"Adoption and Abortion: Why is Adoption so unregulated, but Abortion heavily regulated? Are these two issues connected?","I've heard that there has been a massive drop in the amount of available-for-adoption infants in recent years (which started after Roe v Wade). I always thought that this was due to the higher availability (and lower stigmatization) of contraception; and while I think this is a big part of it, abortions are also probably keeping a lot of unwanted pregnancies from resulting in a human for the adoption industry to profit from. 

I've heard some activists bring up that a lot of adoption agencies are actively lobbying for stricter abortion regulation/outright bans. Which logically, makes a lot of sense. Since they make their money off of (what is essentially) selling babies. (And when I say babies, I mean infants)

  
There's also, depending on the state, really easy means to change custody of children. There doesn't seem to be any real regulation of adoption here in the USA, and all you need in some states is a notarized document to transfer custody of a child. I don't know a lot about the adoption industry, but I know that there has been a lot of recent activism coming out of now-grown adoptees who are voicing their concerns. What are your thoughts on this?    


It kind of sickens me that PLers always suggest adoption. Because they talk about adoption like its some benevolent savior of unwanted babies. When in reality, it's a surprisingly unregulated industry that is making a profit of selling babies. They never seem to address the serious issues adoption has, and the consequences those issues have on the adopted children later on in their lives.",t2_15qcfjj7,1633616810,prochoice

I'm annoyed.,"My (16) mom and dad just tried to tell me that my opinions on abortion was wrong wrong because I agreed that it should be legal and accessible. I genuinely feel awful and annoyed. I tried to explain to them that it's a clump of cells, and I kid you not, my mom said the following stuff to me

- ""if you use every method of contraception at once there's no way it could fail""
- ""it has a heartbeat, it's alive""
- ""You're wrong""
- ""tell that to a pregnant woman who just miscarried"" (when I said it was a clump of cells for the time abortions happen)
- ""well we might aswell just shoot people who are living then""
- ""abortions are only nessacery if the person is a child, raped, or if the baby was formed under incestuous reasons""
- ""just keep your legs closed if you don't want to get pregnant""
- ""just don't get pregnant""
- ""how would you know the day after if your pregnant? You wouldn't."" (In response to me saying that plan B was also a good thing to use- she's also againstthat because she said it kills fetuses)
- ""Your way of thinking is so backwards""
- ""There's no reason to have an abortion""

She also proceeded to speak over me, loudly, might I add, whenever I tried to explain my point of view. I tried to tell her about this subreddit, and how people here don't just do it for kicks or birth control, and how reading people's experiences with abortion caused me to change my point of view. She started raising her voice even more and speaking over me, while I just calmly tried to explain. She told me to go to my room, and my dad said to ""shut the fuck up"" and when the person on the radio (who was talking abt texas' abortion ban) mentioned the heartbeat thing, he said ""yeah, listen to the professionals"" (despite him and my mom being antivaxxers, getting their anti vaxxer info from Facebook, thinking the govt is putting chips in them, and only getting vaccinated so they can keep their jobs)

They also said ""well what if we aborted you"" and knowing me, who hates living, I said ""well I would have been pretty damn happy.""

When I pointed out that they were acting like children when they spoke over me and yelled/raised their voice, they happened to get even more mad and said I was just a kid myself and to be quiet

Idk. I feel sick to know I live with people who could very well have a say over my body. It most likely won't happen, but in the event I do get pregnant underage, I want to have the choice. I already know that I don't want to carry out a pregnancy. I don't want kids ever, and I never have.

Wanna know the ironic thing? My mom judges others when she thinks they're bad parents. She raves about how people at her work were ""too young to be having kids"" and how half of them would be bad parents. Really ironic. Let's just say she's one to talk about being a ""good parent.""

How do you view false equivalencies between Abortion and other things?,"""I support abortion rights for the same reasons of bodly autonomy that I support other forms of birth control and euthanasia."" Some may say.

However, with abortion being more and more in the news as of late I'm wondering  how I can be sure to be wary of false equivalencies when thinking about the topic. I have 5 areas that I thought of but it doesn't have to be limited to that. Feel free to say if it's best compared to something I haven't thought about. 


* Other forms of birth control. In general, but most notably vasectomies. Considering that they're seen as permanent and some of the ""what about the men"" crowd like to be edgy and go ""his body his choice"" etc. Part of me thinks it's a false equivalency to lump vasectomies with abortion and other forms of uterine birth control, and other forms of uterine birth control with abortion, but maybe it isn't. I have no idea.

* Euthanasia is often lumped with abortion considering it can be construed as involving bodly autonomy and terminating something that interferes with it. Again, it's something that the aforementioned ""what about the men"" crowd likes to use to be edgy and go ""hurr durr I have bodly autonomy too right?"". However perhaps it's a false equivalency considering there's no gender equality component to it. And thus, they may not be as necessary. Perhaps it's comparable because the disease is within you the same way as a pregnancy is. But I have no idea.

* Same Sex Marriage is another thing that people may lump abortion with as they may see it as a similarly socially liberal position. You could argue that it represents autonomy considering two people make the choice to get married. But is that a false equivalency? Maybe, maybe not.

* Transitioning genders is another thing that's seen as a socially liberal position, and it has aspects too that could fall under the argument of bodly autonomy. As well as aspects of proactive applications  of psychological well being necessity. But I have no clue.

* Perhaps abortion is best compared with the police killings of unarmed Black individuals. Considering race and gender can be argued to be more encompassing and omnipresent forms of marginalization than class, disability, sexual orientation, and other variables. 

* Or maybe it's best compared with taxes on childlessness. Countries have taxed people for not being married and not having children. But who knows if this falls under bodly autonomy.


So set the record straight. How can you know when something is approaching false equivalency territory and what isn't?

Abortion Uncertainty,"I’m currently trying to make an logical ideological decision for myself about ProLife and ProChoice. 

I wished to discuss some of my issues or areas of uncertainty &amp; maybe gain some input. 

1. PC advocates for choice in abortion - does the movement have a generally considered cut off for this i.e. 26 weeks, 30 weeks, days before birth due? 
2. PC cite the choice in control over ones body. Would this also apply to suicide - should someone have free control over that? Or is Mental illness a barrier? 
3. PC advocate for women’s rights in abortion - how can men’s rights as potential fathers be considered? 
4. PC want free choice in their lives over abortion; but want restrictions generally in other avenues. This more relates to USA &amp; gun control. Politically I read left sided politics as PC &amp; pro gun control &amp; right as PL &amp; constitutional rights to bare arms. I generalisation; but do these marry up? If not, why not? 
5. Do people find it difficult in PC to advocate for abortion (terminating a baby/foetus) oppose death penalty on the religious-esque basis of taking a life. I’m not religious - but I find the argument against taking a life via DP can be used for/against abortion in some ways. Foetus is innocent etc.

Accusing Antiabortionists of Torture,"I’ve struggled with the framing of this post for a while. So, be patient.

For the past year or so, I’ve been using a novel tactic in the abortion debate. I’ve been accusing antiabortionists of torture. When I started, I didn’t realize what my goal was: only that it produced interesting results. My goal has solidified. I now use this argument because it puts antiabortionists on the defensive. My goal is to get antiabortionists to defend their arguments, support torture, and discover the base underpinnings of what one has to believe to be prolife/antiabortionist. I don’t really draw a line between these two terms because I believe most people are pro-choice when presented with questions that are drawn from these arguments.

If you’d like to try this out. Here are some pointers. 

Let’s start with the definition of torture from the google search “define torture:”

“the action or practice of inflicting severe pain or suffering on someone as a punishment or in order to force them to do or say something.”

The key terms here are “severe pain” and “suffering” inflicted on another. From this, I’ve assembled this mantra:

“In life, pain is unavoidable. However, when pain passes a certain threshold, it becomes suffering. It is not necessary for us to argue about where that threshold starts, because the severe pain and suffering of gestation, labor, birth, and recovery is well beyond that threshold. If a person accepts their own suffering it elevates that suffering to a personal sacrifice and devotion. If you demand that another suffers for your beliefs, then that suffering is torture.”

In order to argue that forcing a person to give birth is torture, you don’t need to use this mantra in the argument at all. But you do have to understand it and internalize it. What you need to do is give your opponent the definition of torture and verify they agree that forcing birth is torture. Do not waiver until they admit that forced birth is torture. It should be easy for them AND they will refuse to do it. And you will want to understand their reasoning. Because, by definition, forcing someone to give birth is torture. However, there are many definitions of when life begins and no one can agree on those. Furthermore, if someone agrees that abortion is murder, then their underlying concern is human suffering. By that logic, torture should concern them: as all atrocities should. And, because they probably believe murder is much worse than the pain and suffering a woman feels during the torture of forced birth, then it shouldn’t be any skin off their back to admit that forcing a woman to bare a child is torture. It is often very difficult for them to admit to torture.

Make them tell you why forced birth isn’t torture. Make them explain it and don’t leave that point till they admit that it is torture. They will spew some of the most horrible, antiabortionist, Catholic, Evangelical reasoning very quickly. They will say, sex is for procreation only. It obviously isn’t. We have a billion dollar birth control industry in this country. The majority of people don’t believe that, so it’s a religious extremist argument. Nor, if asked, would the majority of people believe that sex itself is implicitly or explicitly an agreement to bare a child. That’s a religious extremist argument as well.

I don’t want to labor, sorry, this point. I have simply found this line of questioning to be very enlightening. I have argued this over and over again and have heard it all. So, if you want counterarguments, please ask questions about anything above. I can provide rebuttals on most points they would push.

Edit: I don't want to come off sounding like this is easy to argue. I'm probably going to write a follow-up post, but I thought this was enough for now.

Additional: I usually broach this argument by saying, ""Well, how is it that you rationalize torture?"" ""It's better than murder!"" ""So, you do agree it's torture then?"" ""No."" Provide definition. Reprompt with, ""How is it not?""",t2_65x13yco,1633463854,prochoice
just got done arguing with some pro-birthers,"there were these people representing pro-birth on my college campus like ten minutes ago, and it made me sooo mad. the guy didn’t even have a valid argument 💀 anyways so i argued with him and i kept just getting so mad the more he talked and someone passing by had to pull me away and remind me that he’s just doing it so he can gain propoganda for the church, and that not a single person on this campus doesn’t agree with me. it was nice to be pulled away from the situation but idk. i’m proud that i didn’t just walk by, i think i would’ve been more upset if i hadn’t said anything, but now i’m just worried i was too angry and that’s gonna be used against the pro choice community. advice?",t2_57hs87ea,1633457551,prochoice

Trump-era “domestic gag rule” reversed thanks to Biden administration,"BY: [**Marlee Kokotovic**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/marlee-kokotovic/) \- October 5, 2021

Read the article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/10/05/trump-era-domestic-gag-rule-reversed-thanks-to-biden-administration/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/10/05/trump-era-domestic-gag-rule-reversed-thanks-to-biden-administration/)

The Biden administration just made the decision to reverse a Trump-era “domestic gag rule.”  

According to the [Center for Reproductive Rights](https://reproductiverights.org/biden-administration-to-rescind-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule/), the domestic gag rule prohibits providers in the Title X network from referring patients for abortion care. It also requires physical and financial separation of Title X services from abortion care and rescinds a prior requirement that all providers in the Title X network offer information and counseling to pregnant patients on their options—including prenatal care and delivery, infant care, foster care and adoption, and abortion care—in a manner that is nondirective and does not steer patients toward a particular option.

Nearly 1,000 clinics dropped out of the Title X program—which subsidizes contraception, cancer screenings, and other care for low-income patients—in 2019 due to the rule implemented under former President Donald Trump, reports [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/10/04/major-victory-abortion-rights-biden-reverse-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule). 

This new rule reversal is set to go into effect on November 8th, 2021.

“This rule is a step forward for family planning care as it aims to strengthen and restore our nation’s Title X program. Our nation’s family planning clinics play a critical role in delivering healthcare. And today more than ever, we are making clear that access to quality family planning care includes accurate information and referrals—based on a patient’s needs and direction,” says the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra.

With productive rights being at the forefront of many activistic causes recently, this is a huge victory. Many human rights activists and lawmakers have stepped forward cheering on this decision. 

“No matter where patients receive their healthcare, they should have information about the full spectrum of options available to them when they are pregnant, without political interference. The Title X family planning program ensures that no matter how much money you make, people have access to information that is timely, evidence-based, and accurate covering all options, ” says Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, an Indiana-based board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health. 

“The end of the Title X gag rule is a major victory for patients, access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and health equity. Title X is a critical piece of our social safety net that can, and should, ensure that people with low incomes can access essential healthcare without forcing providers to withhold referrals for all of the options available to them,” says Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA).",t2_2chu0rj6,1633444687,prochoice
How to respond to someone who thinks women use abortions as a form of birth control?,"When having conversations about the topic of abortion, I occasionally have people ask me something along the lines of “what if a woman uses abortion as a form of birth control?”

I often do not know how to respond because I feel like this is an absurd question but I would like to be able to provide an educated response to this question if I am asked again. 

Unfortunately, I usually get this question from people who identify as pro-choice, but “have known someone” who used abortion as bc. How do you respond to this question/ scenario?",t2_9lczy723,1633432209,prochoice
Abortion: Should you be Pro-Life or Pro-Choice? A defense of Abortion and why it should be legalized and de-stigmatized.,"Note: A while back, I made a very similar post, defending abortion, but I've noticed some errors in wording and my overall arguments. So I've decided to delete it, and repost my edited version. Thank you for the silver medal and I hope you enjoy this new and improved post.

And if you're Pro-Life, I ask of you to read this post and my arguments de-criminalizing and destigmatizing abortion, for I have read yours demonizing it. You might not agree, but please, be nice.

1. (You’re killing children/humans)

No I’m not. Murder, by definition, is the purpose full ending/killing of a human life. The killing of a person. The fetus is neither. The thing that makes a human a human is sentience. The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without cognitive abilities, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings.

A fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of self. A fetus is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell. A fetus cannot survive outside of a woman's body, as it's own being.

A baby can. Therefore stabbing a baby is illegal even though it isn't exactly sentient, as it can survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. A fetus has neither sentience, nor the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable without a capable host that is a woman’s body, when it cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It's not murder as the fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. It's not murder if a woman decides to abort the fetus in HER BODY. It’s called bodily autonomy. And as such, the argument that a fetus is human so abortion is murder and should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic.

And even IF fetuses were sentient, women still have the right to their bodily autonomy to abort the fetus. If I get in a car accident, and my twin sister was the only one whose blood was compatible with mine, I cannot FORCE her to donate blood. Doesn't matter if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe and painless procedure. Even if it was to save MY life. A fully sentient person with the ability to think and feel. Her right to her bodily autonomy trumps my right to live. If she doesn't want to give up a small part of her body-her blood- to save my life, it's perfectly legal for her to do so. Then why should it be illegal for a woman to not want to give up her body for 9 months through abortion? It isn't murder, it's bodily autonomy. The fetus is in MY body, and if I don't want it there, it's perfectly legal for me to remove it. The blood is in my sisters body, and if she doesn't want to give me HER blood, it's legal for her to do so. If I don't want a fully sentient individual in my body, giving me health problems, I have every right to remove it, even if it dies. If my sister doesn't want to donate her blood, she has every right to do so, even if I'll die.

And if you're going to say that every fertilized egg counts for an individual sentient human being, and therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm fertilized an egg didn't become a sentient human being? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding. You literally don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, if that’s what you believe, you should start a petition to ban hysterectomies, as the sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg attaches itself the the uterus, if a woman has no uterus, then the fertilized egg passes through her. But sterilization isn’t banned. Why not? Why are people against abortion?

Why are people against the removal of a fertilized egg from the uterus? Why is it only when it’s attached to the body part of a woman, in a woman’s body, sucking and taking nutrients from the woman, that people are against the removal of it? Sexism is terrible and it ruins the lives of women every day. As a man, you might have the benefit of not noticing. Of not needing to care. But for millions of women every day, they don’t have that privilege.

2. (All life is important/precious/…) (Life begins at conception)

So to be clear, you mean that all human life is important/precious, and you believe that a fetus/fertilised egg is a human. Well, a fetus/fertilised egg isn’t human. What counts as a human life, and what makes a living thing human, is sentience. \*cue my previous argument\* The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without a brain, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings. A fetus/fertilised egg isn't human as it has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of self. A fetus/fetilised egg is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell, outside of a woman’s body. A fetus/fertilised egg cannot survive on its own, as its own being. A baby/child can survive outside a woman’s body, on its own, as its own being.

So calling a fetus/fertilised egg a human life dehumanizing towards actual humans with fully formed brains and sentience, the ability to think and feel, survive outside of a woman’s body and the awareness of self. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable outside of a woman’s body, when it cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. CELL LIFE begins at conception. HUMAN LIFE begins after birth. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It’s called bodily autonomy.

And like I said before, if you're going to say that every fertilized egg counts for an individual sentient human being, and therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm fertilized an egg didn't become a sentient human being? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding. You literally don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, if that’s what you believe, you should start a petition to ban hysterectomies, as the sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg attaches itself the the uterus, if a woman has no uterus, then the fertilized egg passes through her. But sterilization isn’t banned. Why not? Why are people against abortion?

Why are people against the removal of a fertilized egg from the uterus? Why is it only when it’s attached to the body part of a woman, in a woman’s body, sucking and taking nutrients from the woman, that people are against the removal of it? Sexism is terrible and it ruins the lives of women every day. As a man, you might have the benefit of not noticing. Of not needing to care. But for millions of women every day, they don’t have that privilege .

And even IF a fertilised egg/fetus was sentient, (which it most certainly is not) women still have the right to their bodily autonomy to abort the fetus. If I get in a car accident, and my twin sister was the only one whose blood was compatible with mine, I cannot FORCE her to donate blood. Doesn't matter if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe and painless procedure. Even if it was to save MY life. A fully sentient person with the ability to think and feel. Her right to her bodily autonomy trumps my right to live. If she doesn't want to give up a small part of her body-her blood- to save my life, it's perfectly legal for her to do so. Then why should it be illegal for a woman to not want to give up her body for 9 months through abortion? It isn't murder, it's bodily autonomy. The fetus is in MY body, and if I don't want it there, it's perfectly legal for me to remove it. If the fetus cannot survive outside a host body, on it's own, as it's own being, it is perfectly legal for me to exercise my bodily autonomy and remove it from my body. The blood is in my sisters body, and if she doesn't want to give me HER blood, it's legal for her to do so. If I don't want a fully sentient individual in my body, giving me health problems, I have every right to remove it, even if it dies. If my sister doesn't want to donate her blood, she has every right to do so, even if I'll die. Please read my argument no. 4.

And as such, the argument that a fetus/fertilized is human so abortion should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic. Your beliefs, however much you think is just, do not supersede a woman's right to her bodily autonomy

3. ( But it’s against God/ It’s unholy)

So? Which God? Your god? Well, you do realize there’s a reason why the bible, or any religious scripture, isn’t used as laws and policies in the Government right? Just because something’s holy doesn’t mean it’s ethical, legal, or morally right. And just because something’s unholy doesn’t mean it’s unethical, illegal or amoral. Holiness isn’t a judge for morality. I could sacrifice a virgin or kill my firstborn son because God told me to, and that would be holy, but it wouldn’t be ethically, morally or legally right. You can have religion. You shouldn’t use religion to take away the freedom, free will and bodily autonomy of others. And besides, if your God is against bodily autonomy, free will, and promotes the oppression of women and anyone who doesn't follow him(lower case “h” on purpose) then maybe you shouldn’t follow him. After all, “Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and you will have made the world a better place.” I will say this again, don’t use your religious beliefs to take away the bodily autonomy and free will of others, particularly women in this case. Just because it’s a religious belief does not mean it’s morally ethically or legally right. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

4. (My body My Choice only makes sense if someone else’s life isn’t at stake)

“Someone’s life” First of all, let’s get the semantics right. A fetus isn’t someONE. It isn’t a human being. How do I know that? Because it doesn’t have sentience and it isn’t viable without a capable host. It cannot survive on its own, without sucking the nutrients of the host, without needing the host to build it’s every cell, and it cannot survive outside of the host, that is the woman. It cannot survive on it's own, outside of the woman's body, as it's own being.

We can legally pull the plug on brain dead people because they don’t have any cognitive ability. They don’t think and they don’t feel. And on top of that, they cannot survive without a life support system. A fetus can’t think or feel and it doesn’t have sentience. A fetus is not yet viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive without sucking the woman’s nutrients, without her building it’s every cell, without being attached to her uterus, without taking up space in her body, without squishing her organs, and it cannot survive outside a woman’s body. A human can survive outside a woman’s body and has sentience.

And Fun Fact, if my mother was in a car accident and desperately needed a blood transfusion to live… and I was the only person on Earth who could donate blood to save her, and even if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe, and quick procedure, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO GIVE BLOOD. Yes, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate blood if I don’t want to. My bodily autonomy trumps a FULLY SENTIENT woman's right to live, and a fetus has neither sentience, nor the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being.

If my father needed a kidney transplant because he has kidney cancer on both his kidneys, and I was the only person on Earth with kidneys compatible with his, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY TO GIVE UP ONE OF MY KIDNEYS. Even if the chance of me dying is low, even if I have two kidneys and am under anesthesia and feel no pain during the operation, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate my kidney if I don’t want to. Yet in some countries, it’s perfectly legal to force a woman with an unwanted pregnancy to go through labor-a painful, arduous and gratuitous experience where the woman is completely awake and has to push a 8 pound baby out of her vagina- for a clump of cells that don’t think, feel, have sentience or the ability to survive outside a woman's body, as it's own being. See, we have this thing called “bodily autonomy”. It’s this cultural notion that a person’s control over their own body is above all important and must not be infringed upon.

We can’t even take LIFE SAVING organs from CORPSES unless the person the corpse once contained gave consent before their death. Even CORPSES have more bodily autonomy than women, and they aren’t even alive!

To tell people that they MUST sacrifice their bodily autonomy for 9 months against their will in an incredibly expensive, invasive, painful and difficult process to grow a clump of cells that have no brain, sentience, awareness of self or feelings, (in the earlier stages of pregnancy where the vast majority of pregnancies are performed) is desperately unethical. Also, women do not “carry babies.” They build every single cell of the fetus’s body. Women are not passive vessels unencumbered by pregnancy. The fetus that is not yet viable without a capable host does not supersede the bodily autonomy of a sentient woman. You can’t even ask corpses to sacrifice their bodily autonomy to give up organs that they aren’t using anymore as their dead.

You’re asking people who can become pregnant to accept less bodily autonomy than we grant to a literal corpse.

5. (You had sex and this is your punishment)

Who are you to decide what my punishment is? To decide whether I should even have one? Saying that pregnancy is a punishment for sex and that the baby the woman is forced to birth is her punishment is so dehumanizing. Why should a child grow up under the care of someone who is unfit to be a parent? Why must the child live out his/her life negatively affected by not being wanted? That the sole purpose for his/her existence is to punish his/her biological mother? That’s just plain cruel. You’re ruining the life of the child and the woman who was forced to give birth to it. Also, what does your argument have to do with anything? I think it might even be an argument for the legalization of abortion. Sex isn’t unethical, amoral or illegal and therefore no punishment is necessary. The woman doesn’t deserve the punishment(having to give birth to a baby), the baby shouldn’t have to live out it’s life as a punishment and the woman can abort the non-sentient, non- self-aware fetus that is not yet viable without her body as it's host. Also, what you think is wrong does not supersede the woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. This is one of the flimsiest arguments I’ve ever heard.

6. a(You’re preventing someone from existing) b( What if your mom didn’t have you)

6a First of all, if you’re a woman, you’ll have millions of egg cells containing DNA, all with the potential of being fertilized. If you're a man, you have millions of sperm cells all with the potential of fertilizing. So according to your logic, if you don’t have millions of kids, you’re preventing millions of people from existing. Women who agree with this argument against abortion, please get pregnant at whatever age you start to menstruate and have a kid a year. Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, get knocked up each and every year of your life. If you start menstruating at 12, and die at 90, have at least 78 kids. But even then you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have all your eggs be fertilized. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! Men who agree with the argument against abortion, please get impregnate whomever and whoever you meet, even if they’re 11/12/13/14/15. Have sex unprotected with millions of women a year. Ensure they all get pregnant. Start doing that at 12.Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, knock up millions of women each year. According to your logic, if you don’t spend each and every moment of your time having unprotected sex, you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have each sperm you produce fertilize one egg that’s your bad. FYI, like I said, you have millions of sperm. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! \*end of me making fun of this argument\*.

You can’t biologically have millions of kids, you’re just not meant to. And you're not preventing anyone from existing if you have an abortion, because they don’t exist. How can you prevent someone from not existing, IF THEY DON’T EXIST? You have millions of egg cells in your ovaries. Are you going to be pregnant and in labor each and every year until you die? But even then there are still millions of egg cells left unfertilized. So according your logic, unless you live millions of years, you’re preventing the existence of millions of children. Doesn’t that just seem stupid? Besides, like I said, you can't prevent someone from existing if they don’t exist. Your incorrect beliefs do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

6b . First of all, if my mom chose not to biologically have kids, she wouldn’t be preventing my existence because I wouldn’t exist. And since she didn’t know it would be me, (I didn’t even know I’d be me) theoretically, the baby she gave birth to decades ago could have been anyone from the future president of China, to a homicidal maniac. Also, I didn’t exist for billions of years. \*I’m going to go on a bit of a rant now\*

I didn’t exist when I could die from simply going out of whatever shelter I lived in. I didn’t exist when the earliest settlers arrived in China, living in caves and hunting game, only to die from a little cut because antibiotics didn’t exist. I didn’t exist during various dynasties, when famine was always around the corner, poverty everywhere, and class differences huge. I didn’t exist during the 19th century when child labor was common place and even in Britain, child mortality rates where shockingly high. Also, people would taint milk with anything from lead to borax and you were lucky to have pond water in your milk. Also, I had pneumonia as a child and if I were born in the 19th and even 20th century, I would have died. I didn't exist during World War 1/2 and the NanKing massacre where millions of Chinese people died. I didn’t exist during The Great Famine when desperate people would resort to eating their dead in order to survive. I was born later on, with access to education, the internet and various luxuries like the air conditioner and an indoor bathroom. I am glad I didn’t exist for millions of years(even more if you’re counting the time before Homo Sapiens walked on the Earth). \*end of rant\*.

My point is, I was born. I didn’t feel the pain of not existing for millions/billions of years, because I didn’t exist. If my mom chose not to have kids, I would feel nothing because I wouldn't exist. I would thank her for her choice if I were even around to care. She wouldn’t be preventing my existence, because I wouldn’t fricking exist.

And therefore, you’re argument and weaponization of my mom is stupid. So those slogans that say “Your mom chose life, you should too” are stupid. Even if my mom didn’t choose to keep the non-sentient fetus not yet viable without sucking her nutrients and using her as it’s host, she wouldn’t be ending my life, because I didn’t exist. I wouldn’t even know because I wouldn’t be sentient enough to care. My mom chose to gestate and keep the fetus. It's her choice and her life. I chose to abort the fetus, it's my choice and my life.

As a fetus I was not conscious or aware of our existence, so if I was aborted I would never have known. My parent made the choice to gestate and give birth, that doesn't mean I have to do the same.

My mother's situation when she was pregnant was entirely different than my situation and my life, and it is ultimately irrelevant. I should not make the decision to have a child simply because I exist. I believe children should be wanted, and should not exist simply because of perceived obligation.

And also, even if she was preventing my existence by aborting the fetus, she isn’t ethically or morally wrong. It’s her body and it’s her choice. She has every right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

(You’re killing babies/ unborn child)

By saying “unborn child” you are insinuating that the fetus attached to the uterus of a woman, is in fact a child that has yet to be born. I am here to argue that you are wrong in that assumption/insinuation. This is quite similar to the argument that fetuses are human beings. Please read my argument above opposing that idea.

Let’s get our semantics right. An unborn child isn’t a child, it’s a fetus. A baby/child is someone who is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as it's own being, without taking up her uterus, sucking her nutrients and doesn’t need her to grow anymore. A fetus is a fetal embryo not viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive on its own, as its own being.

Whatever your beliefs, a non-sentient, non-feeling, fetus that cannot survive outside a willing host does not supersede that of the woman with it in her uterus. The fetus is in her body, and cannot survive outside of her uterus, as it's own being, unlike a baby. She has the bodily autonomy to decide whether or not to let it stay inside her uterus or abort it by removing it. Aborting a fetal embryo isn't killing a baby, because a fetus and a baby aren't the same. The woman can’t abort a baby that is born, because it’s out of her body and is no longer sucking up her nutrients, and she is no longer building every cell of it.

Think of it as a life support system. The fetus is essentially brain dead (no cognitive ability whatsoever) on a life support system that is the body of the woman, and she has every right to take it off its life support system that’s essentially her body. Once the fetus no longer needs the life support system to survive, and exits her body, she cannot take it off the life support system as it no longer needs it. She cannot stab it as it's OUTSIDE her body and can live AS IT'S OWN BEING. It’s the same with late term abortions. The fetus still doesn’t have any cognitive ability whatsoever, and is on a life support system that is the woman, and cannot live as it's own being. She can choose to take it off it’s life support system that’s her body.

What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body.

If it needs to be inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus, sucking HER nutrients, squishing HER organs and need HER to build every cell of its body, it is not a baby/child, it’s a fetus that is not yet viable without a host, inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus. And if she wants to abort it, if she doesn’t want to let it stay inside HER BODY, she has the bodily autonomy to abort it by medically removing it from HER uterus and HER body. The non-sentient non feeling and non-self aware fetus that is not yet viable without a willing host, does not supersede that of the woman with it in Her Body.

The removal of a non-sentient, non-thinking, non-feeling fetus that cannot survive on it's own, as it's own being outside it's host body - the woman-, isn't the killing of a baby, someone who doesn't have sentience, but can survive on it's own, outside the woman, as it's own being, it's the exercise of the woman's bodily autonomy. So anyone who chooses to abort a fetus is not killing a baby, because a fetus isn’t one. They are choosing to not let the fetus stay in their body, its host, not killing a baby. What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE a woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body. When it is not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body(uterus), it is a fetus and the woman has every right to choose to not let it remain in HER BODY. It’s called bodily autonomy. Once it’s out of her body, she cannot abort it, as it’s already out, and can survive without her body as its host.

She cannot stab it as it's outside HER BODY, and can survive as it's own being. This is a matter of bodily autonomy and women’s rights. The non sentient fetal embryo that cannot survive without its life support system, that's the woman, isn’t more important than a sentient woman with the ability to think and feel. How is it that some people still fail to grasp this very simple concept? Your misguided beliefs about what constitutes a fetus, a baby and a child do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

There’s also another brilliant argument. Here’s the link:[https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i\_dont\_care\_about\_the\_semantics/?utm\_source=amp&amp;utm\_medium=&amp;utm\_content=post\_body](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i_dont_care_about_the_semantics/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body)

my opinion on late term abortions:

I don’t get the controversy around late term abortions. The fetus still requires a host that is the woman, and the woman has every right to her bodily autonomy, and remove it from her body if she doesn’t want to play host. And it’s quite clear that people understand the difference between a fetus and a baby.

What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it is OUTSIDE the woman's body and can survive as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body.

If it needs to be inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus, sucking HER nutrients, squishing HER organs and need HER to build every cell of its body, it is not a baby/child, it’s a fetus that is not yet viable without a host, inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus. And if she wants to abort it, if she doesn’t want to let it stay inside HER BODY, she has the bodily autonomy to abort it by medically removing/aborting it from HER uterus and HER body, even if it's a late-term abortion. SINCE IT'S IN HER BODY, SHE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH/TO IT. EVEN IF THE LETHAL INJECTION IS NEEDED. It is NOT murder, please read argument number 1.

The non-sentient non feeling and non-self aware fetus does not supersede that of the woman with it in Her Body. CELL LIFE begins at conception, HUMAN LIFE begins after BIRTH.

If you had a petri dish with a fetus in one hand, and a baby in another, and you were forced to drop one, I think you would choose to drop the petri dish. She cannot abort a born baby, because it’s OUT of her body, and no longer needs her as it’s host to survive.

She cannot stab it, because it's out of HER BODY and can SURVIVE ON IT'S OWN, AS IT'S OWN BEING. This is a matter of bodily autonomy and women’s rights. The non sentient fetal embryo that cannot survive without its life support system, that's the woman, isn’t more important than a sentient woman with the ability to think and feel. I don’t know why people believe otherwise.

Just because you don’t like late term abortions/abortions doesn’t mean it’s ethically, morally or legally wrong. Just because you don't like it isn’t a good enough reason to restrict women’s right to their bodily autonomy. For example, I despise dogs. I know, a controversial opinion. I rather like cats. But just because I don’t like dogs doesn’t mean I have the right to restrict/prevent people from getting one. Your beliefs do not supersede a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

There’s also another brilliant argument. Here’s the link:[https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i\_dont\_care\_about\_the\_semantics/?utm\_source=amp&amp;utm\_medium=&amp;utm\_content=post\_body](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/inr9jy/i_dont_care_about_the_semantics/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body)

(But...but a child was once a fetus)

Just because a child was once a fetus, doesn’t mean a fetus is the same as a child. Please read my argument above on why a fetus isn’t a child, and why it’s ethical to have an abortion. Please read argument number 6 where I argue that aborting a fetus doesn't mean you’re preventing the existence of a child. And I implore you, kind human, to read argument number 4 on why it’s doesn’t matter if abortions prevents the existence of a child. Your beliefs do not supersede women's rights to their bodily autonomy.

Abortion should be legal and destigmatized. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

However happy you are from not aborting, however much you want children, doesn't mean you can take away another woman's right to her bodily autonomy-her right to abort the fetal embryo, her right to not play host to a fetus that isn't viable without her body.

Also, preventing someone from existing, (which you technically can't do), isn't the same as killing a person. Please read my argument no.6 to get an idea why.

I see it this way:
If a fetus is not developed and it doesn't have the ability to conceive thoughts or feel pain, it's not a baby. A baby is what's outside of the womb and developed. It's not murder if you're taking an undeveloped piece of flesh out of your body.

The “would you pull the plug” comparison,"A lot of anti choice people including Ben Shapiro have used the argument that you don’t just kill comatose people even if they’re a burden because they might wake up one day to live a fulfilled life. 

The comparison has been stuck in my mind for weeks and I think I might have figured out why it’s so wrong.
For the comparison to be equal the situation has to be the following:
The person in a coma has no memories, no previous life, not a single person ever knew them or spoke to them, they have no loved ones, they don’t have a name, no one would even notice if they’re gone.  They will wake up after some time but with no abilities or identity, and it will take 18 years for them to gain one. Now there is this one genetic relative that had to sign a contract that if they ever have sex they might have to take over care for the patient for the rest of their life or let them pass away without pain or consciousness. Now if they’re forced to take over full care without help they might suffer physical injuries or even death, it will impact their future career options gravely, possibly making it impossible to reach their goals, cost them a ton of money, they may have support from their partner or be completely on their own, and if they don’t want to do it then when in a few months that patient wakes up and has to relearn everything, there is a very high chance that the caretaker would be miserable, affecting the wellbeing of the patient too, so they might both suffer for 16+ years until they can live on their own again and have an identity, and the patient could lead a very neglected life/end up with a ton of trauma.

This whole thing leaves out that a fetus isn’t even a fully formed human, but even without that I can’t imagine how someone would look at this situation and think “yeah it’s only right to force this person to risk wellbeing and their body to take care of a literal stranger because they signed this contract” when just letting the patient pass away would have barely any impact on anyone but be a great relief to someone who already has a life. Not to mention how messed up if  they were forced into having sex as well..

As for adoption: it would still be crazy to force them to suffer injuries and permanent changes to their body even if they only care for the patient until they wake up, and they would have no way of knowing if they’d receive better care from someone else. Not to mention the guilt and pain of opting out. I think letting them pass away is still a viable option.",t2_19dnjksm,1633340709,prochoice
Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1633334416,prochoice

Abortion Rights Should Not Be Up for Debate,"COMMENT ONLY AFTER READING

Abortion, or the termination of a pregnancy, is healthcare and a woman’s right. As no one can truly understand someone else’s situation, it is not their place to make decisions for that person. Life is a delicate thing; to bring another life into this world by force or coercion is wrong. Abortion should not be up for debate, difficult to obtain, or prohibited. To deny a woman this right or to try to regulate it with further laws is unconstitutional and unjust.

January of 1973, women across America rejoiced as the Supreme Court made their decision on the historic Roe v Wade case. The case was filed against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas, Texas, by Norma McCorvey under the alias of Jane Roe after he attempted to ban abortion except in life-threatening conditions (“Roe v Wade”). When McCorvey filed the lawsuit, she “alleged that the state laws were unconstitutionally vague and abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments” (“Roe v Wade”). Three years after the lawsuit was filed, the Supreme Court voted 7-2 in favor of Roe (“Roe v Wade”). A new clause was then added under the 14th Amendment which made it illegal for states to regulate abortions throughout the first trimester, but allowed states to make their own decisions on abortions done later on in the pregnancy as long as they had the health of the woman in mind (“Roe V Wade”). Although this case was decided nearly 50 years ago by the Supreme Court, pro-life activists are fighting to appeal it.
  

Three years ago, a bill was proposed in Ohio that, if signed, would “[consider an abortion of an “unborn human”] a person under state criminal homicide statutes (The Editorial Board). Furthermore, if a fetus is now viewed as an “unborn human,” the woman who aborted the fetus could be charged with murder. The scary thing about this is that “in Ohio, murder is punishable by life in prison or the death penalty” (The Editorial Board). According to Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, “the Ohio bill is ‘blatantly unconstitutional’” (The Board Editorial). On the other hand, a fetus could not be considered a living thing to begin with because they do not follow all seven characteristics of life.


To be recognized as a living thing, you must respond to your environment, grow and change, be capable of reproduction, have complex chemistry, maintain homeostasis, be composed of cells, and be able to pass your traits onto potential offspring (Wilkin and Gray-Wilson). Yet, a fetus does not have all of these characteristics. It is not until 10 weeks into the pregnancy that a male fetus has fully developed sex organs, and it is not until 20 for a female fetus to have hers - complete with six to seven million eggs (Krock). Besides, the fetus’ brain is not fully developed until 33 weeks, and its lungs are not fully developed until 36 (Aodha). That is not to say that premature babies do not survive, though; the majority of them do.


In the grand scheme of things, actually, a fetus can even go so far as to be labelled as a parasite. Think about it; it leeches off her body by diverting her blood and nutrients, avoids rejection, and influence’s her metabolism for its own benefit (Lowry). The placenta even has a covering around it composed of molecules called phosphocholine which disguise the placenta, thus making it invisible to the host (Lowry). Using this logic, the fetus can be viewed as a parasite - especially in cases when the mother does not want to have the child. 


It is wrong to prevent women from obtaining abortions in situations where they are forcibly impregnated by birth coercion or by rape, as well. In 2019, an eleven year old was raped multiple times by a 26 year old, leaving her pregnant and unable to obtain an abortion because of a new heartbeat bill (Smith). This bill did not give any exceptions to anyone, regardless of if they were raped or carrying a product of incest. In this news article, it states that over 4,000 women were raped in Ohio throughout 2017 according to the FBI (Smith). By passing this new law, women can not abort a fetus after the six week mark because the fetus has a heartbeat. The bill in question is unconstitutional as it goes against Roe v Wade, which prevents states from restricting abortion before the second trimester. 


The eleven year old girl was forced to carry the pregnancy to term, even being victim-blamed by a pregnancy care worker who said that she was, quote, “rebellious [and] refuses to listen to her mother and runs away from home all the time” (Smith). This is, of course, not a justifiable excuse as to why she was raped. Her rapist, Juan Leon-Gomez, was arrested on a million-dollar bond shortly after. 


Ohio is not the only state to pass this bill, however. Five other states had already decided to do the same, including Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Louisiana, and Georgia (Campoy and Merelli). Hundreds of thousands of women are now trapped by the law, unable to abort regardless of the circumstances. The government was looking for a reform, but this is not the kind of reform women were looking for. Having access to family planning saves more lives than it takes.
In Argentina, two young girls at the ages of eleven and twelve were raped by men in their 60s (Zorn). Both of these girls were forced to carry their pregnancies to term, and both received c-sections around six months into the pregnancy (Zorn). Neither of the babies survived. Eric Zorn, the author of the article about this tragedy, further elaborates on the situation:


The case of the 11-year-old girl, known in the press by the pseudonym “Lucia,”
was particularly disturbing. She discovered she was pregnant by her grandmother’s boyfriend at 17 weeks, according to the Guardian, and even though the law allowed her get an abortion as a rape victim, government, health and religious officials along with anti-abortion activists in her home province strove to delay her family’s request for an abortion until the fetus was deemed viable and it was too late for an abortion. Hospital nurses reportedly gave Lucia steroid shots to help the fetus’ lungs mature but told her they were vitamin shots, while lawyers swamped the family with paperwork (Zorn).


The basis of this is undoubtedly disgusting. Stripping young girls and women of their rights to bodily autonomy results in them having less rights than a corpse. Pro-lifers have even gone so far as to spread false information about contraceptives, claiming that Plan B-type pills are an abortive (Ruse and Schwarzwalder). This is completely false, as abortive pills can induce an abortion within the first nine weeks, while Plan B-type pills can be used only within 72 hours of unprotected sex (The Difference). Once again, contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel or progestin simply prevent ovulation, thus preventing an egg from ever being fertilized. Abortive pills medically induce an abortion after conception. 


An article from Gale describes abortive pills as an alternative to surgical abortion, which is a series of two pills. One contains mifepristone, and the other contains misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks an essential hormone for pregnancy, called progesterone (“Abortion”). Two days later, the second pill is taken to contract the uterus and expel the embryo (“Abortion”). If a woman happens to change her mind before taking the misoprostol pill, it is not possible. According to a study done by the University of California in 2019, attempting to counter the effects of mifepristone with progesterone could lead to severe vaginal bleeding (“Abortion’). In conclusion, medically induced abortion is not to be confused with emergency contraception, as a medically induced abortion is effective for nine weeks, whereas emergency contraception only works up to three days after unprotected sex.


Many pro-lifers are blinded by the existence of life. They see the removal of an embryo as a sin, proposing the rhetorical question as to why assisted suicide is illegal but abortion is not. They frenziedly ask, “what if that baby could have found the cure for cancer?” or “what if that baby could have been the next Mother Theresa?” But that is the thing; they are all just questions of “what if.” We,s a society, can not flourish on questions of “what if.” To bring religion into the mix throws off the balance of what is constitutional and what is not.     


We, as a country, were founded on the basis of freedom of religion; we came here to escape religious persecution. Laws and restrictions based on religious beliefs are unconstitutional and morally wrong, as one should never enforce their beliefs on others by taking legal action. Influencing someone’s opinion, however, is morally wrong the second false information is brought into the discussion. Pro-lifers seem to throw all logical reasoning out the window by ignoring scientifical facts and jumping straight to labelling women who obtain abortions as “murderers.” 


In an article previously mentioned, written by Ruse and Schwarzwalder, it is claimed that the Supreme Court ruling of abortions within the first trimester is false. They claimed that “the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade did not create a limited right to abortion but a virtually unlimited right to abortion throughout pregnancy” (Ruse and Schwarzwalder). Throughout their article, they commonly use quotation marks around terms to twist the mood of the sentence to their liking. When they acknowledge that the Supreme Court ruled abortion legal in all factors, including emotional, they later highlight that by painting it in a negative light. 


Abortion is an emotional subject, which even more so strengthens the argument as to why abortion is only the woman involved’s decision. Teenage pregnancy is also a huge part of the abortion argument. Accidents can happen, contraceptive methods could not work, or the pregnancy could be caused from rape. Teenage girls need easier access to abortion, without the requirement to notify their parents. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy says that, quote, “minors have a right to privacy” (The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy). This implies the right to a discretionary abortion. 


Parental involvement in teenage abortions and pregnacy is humilating and potentially harmful, as not everyone’s parents are accepting and understanding. To vouch for mandatory parental consent is detrimental to the safety of the girl. An article written by Francie Diep acknowledges the experiences of a few girls, one of them belonging to a girl named Sandra, saying that she “feared her father would kick her out, or worse [if he found out she was pregnant]” (Diep). Another girl, Vanessa feared humiliation due to her parents’ religious beliefs (Diep). The third girl, Jacqueline feared her father would disown her if he found out (Diep). 


Teenagers who face a judge in the process of trying to get an abortion feel that the judges disregard their plea to listen more to their parents. Diep emphasizes this with Jacqueline’s story, restating how Jacqueline felt overlooked when she stood before a judge to prove that she was mature (Diep). Girls are not being taken seriously by courts despite how hard they try to make themselves understood. If they are mature enough to hold down a “prestigious internship” like Jacqueline, then they are mature enough to make their own decisions (Diep). Withholding the right for a young woman to get an abortion because her parents refuse to consent for one is a backwards way of thinking.


The opposite side of the argument, however, believes otherwise for fear of the girls’ safety. Statistically, many young women in California are lured into sexual relationships with pedophiles, whether they want to admit it or not (Jasper). The worst part is these men usually escape criminal charges of statutory rape. Many of them can easily take their girlfriend to Planned Parenthood to get an abortion without consent from the girl’s parents (Jasper). This is because Planned Parenthood is not legally required to contact authorities or the minor’s parents if a minor schedules an appointment for an abortion since all patient information is confidential (Jasper). Thus, any evidence of their criminal act can be swept under the rug and they can get away with it. 
 

Furthermore, most states require parental consent for a teenager to get a tattoo or a piercing, and both schools and hospitals require permission to give a minor aspirin (Jasper). People with this mindset believe that without parental consent, the young woman could be subject to danger or even trauma. They seem to be missing the point, though. Tattoos and piercings are not life-changing, but the birth of an unwanted child is; pregnancy permanently changes a woman’s body. Pregnancy can result in larger feet, melasma, tooth loss, abdominal separation, and even loss of bladder control (“What Permanent Post-Pregnancy Body”). With this in mind, it should not be the parents’ decision to let their daughter abort, even if they plan on putting the child up for adoption after its birth. 
 

While the young woman could be subject to danger or trauma by an abortion, she could very well be subject to both of those things without an abortion. Pregnancy can be extremely traumatic for some women, and it is nearly unimaginable how traumatic it must be to force a teenage girl to carry her pregnancy to term. In countries such as Africa and India, many girls find themselves subject to child marriages. According to an article from Girls Not Brides, over seven million girls under the age of 18 - including two million girls under the age of 14 - give birth in third-world countries (“Raising the Alarm”). The article further explains that about 90% of these births happen within marriage (“Raising the Alarm”). They have no say in their marriages and pregnancies, and they have little to no access to education (“Raising the Alarm”). These girls are left to helplessly take care of their children regardless of how they feel about the situation. One girl affected by this, Kamal, said that when no one was home she would read her old textbooks and cry (“Raising the Alarm”). Another girl, Kanas, said that she cannot even remember when was married off to her husband because she was so young at the time (“Raising the Alarm”). 
  

Sex education is extremely important and should be taught to all children once they reach a certain age. Improper sex education is the cause of most teenage pregnancy, and can result in misinformation regarding the use of contraceptives. To prevent teenage pregnancy and abortion, sex education must be properly taught so kids understand the cause of their actions. However, it is completely up to the girl on whether or not she wishes to abort if an accident happens.
 

Abortion should not be up for debate or challenged by politicians and lawmakers because it is a sensitive topic and it is personal to each woman involved. No one should have the right to restrict access to abortion, or prohibit the obtaining of it. Women have the right to choose regardless of the circumstances, and their rights should not be limited to certain aspects such as rape or incest. It is unconstitutional and morally corrupt to put your own beliefs before someone else’s own life, even if it means that another life may be lost. Life is a fragile thing, but the loss of one may save another. That is why abortion should not be debated or argued against.

Does Planned Parenthood fail to report underaged rape/incest victims?,"Hi. So, I’m not sure what to feel about abortion. If I’m being honest, I’m *really* leaning towards being pro-choice, even though my religion is super against it, which I don’t feel good about. But something that’s really made it hard for me is finding out how Planned Parenthood has treated underaged rape victims (or at least, according to pro-lifers). 

This [article](https://hartzler.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hartzler-55-members-ask-hhs-investigate-planned-parenthood-cover-child) and [this one](https://www.frc.org/op-eds/why-its-impossible-to-support-both-metoo-and-planned-parenthood-without-being-a-big-hypocrite) in particular have me questioning the organization’s ethics. 

Normally, I would overlook these claims, seeing as the pro-life movement has a tendency to lie and twist things for the sake of their arguments. But the stories these articles share appear to be valid. I’m particularly concerned about the case of [Denise Fairbanks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lifelegaldefensefoundation.org/resolved-fairbanks-v-planned-parenthood/amp/). Long story short, she was abused and eventually impregnated by her father, forced to have an abortion, and then dismissed by the staff at Planned Parenthood when she tried to tell what was going on.

Is this true about Planned Parenthood, or have these stories somehow been proven false? I swear this isn’t a “gotcha” question, and that I am just genuinely wondering. I’m sorry if my post makes it look otherwise.",t2_cybxvfug,1633294846,prochoice

Suing Texas Doctors,"I'm new to this subreddit, and with just an initial scanning of the posts I haven't seen anybody mention this, so I apologize if I'm retreading some older posts.  But there have already been two people who have sued the doctor who wrote the WaPo editorial about intentionally breaking the Texas abortion law.  What's to stop thousands of people from filing lawsuits?  It seems like it only costs about $85 to file a claim in Bexar County (where I believe he is located).  I realize that this could have real consequences for the doctor, but in a way he's already stated he's willing to take that challenge on.  Why not overwhelm the courts with these lawsuits, while at the same time revealing the complete lunacy of the law.  I haven't thought this out all that well, but haven't really seen it expressed as a potential strategy.  If the anti-choice people in Texas are upset about two out of staters suing one doctor, how would they respond if hundreds or thousands of people ""took advantage"" of their stupid law.

Infertile people and LGBTQ+ people are not entitled to babies.,"Nobody is. This may seem harsh, but I’m sick of these two demographics being used in the abortion debate. Abortion is an alternative to pregnancy, adoption is an alternative to parenting. They (abortion and adoption) aren’t alternatives to each other. 

I’m against privatized infant adoption in the U.S. and completely against international adoption. For good reasons too long to list here. I have listened to plenty of birth parents and adoptee’s, one great example is @ honestbirthmom on TikTok (if you have it). 

Adoption agencies target at risk parents who would do well with their child if given resources. It’s a for-profit baby selling business. 

Infertile people and LGBTQ+ people are not entitled to other peoples babies. They just aren’t. They may want babies, I want plenty of things, but they aren’t entitled to them just like I’m not entitled to everything I want.

It’s a human being we are talking about, nobody is entitled to a child. I wish pro-lifers stop using this tired argument against abortion. Adoption is not the alternative to abortion. 

Also, so many pro-lifer’s I know would not be okay with the woman keeping the baby if she is poor and would need additional welfare benefits which would lead to tax increases. Their mindset seems to be “Keep the baby, then let a rich white family buy it because we don’t want you living off of our tax dollars.” For the group who talks so much of eugenics, they sure seem to have an issue with poor people deciding to keep their children.",t2_9k7ti03g,1633196282,prochoice

How the abuse of prolife people in my life was explained.,"6 months ago i found out I was pregnant. I knew I needed an abortion and was harassed by people trying to make me change my mind. 

After I chose this life saving health care and survived the people in my life, their actions were explain like this. 

*this is not comparing children to Nuggets or downplaying the hard decision and situation of abortion. I’m telling part of my story and what I’ve learned.*

Very Simpler terms:

Me: I don’t want to eat chicken Nuggets.

Friend: I think you’ll like them.

Me: no, I don’t want them.

Friend: I want you to NOT have pizza.

Friend: you’ll do a great job eating them. You’ll love it once they’re done cooking.

Me: no thanks

Friend: I’ll raise money for you to have some more chicken Nuggets.

Me: but I don’t want them.

Friend: I’m trying to support you with your chicken Nuggets eating.

Me: I don’t need that type of support, I don’t want Nuggets.

It helped me process my feelings of anger towards the people in my life who did this. I thought I was the crazy one for not wanting what they wanted. I couldn’t figure out why i was so hurt by them. And it’s because they tried to shut me up and force “food” down my throat. It hurt but has helped me.",t2_ci7i126k,1633157395,prochoice

A List of Statistics gathered about How Americans currently feel about Abortion,"Hello, I’m a prolife person from the r/prolife subreddit. I decided to try to do my own research on the current popularity of Abortion in the US and come to a reasonable unbiased opinion on the subject. I’ve posted this post to both subs r/prochoice and r/prolife to keep both sides up to date. Even though I’m biased in favor of prolife, I’m going to try to keep any bias to a minimum and instead I’m simply going to post what the current polling suggests. 

##General Stats

[People who identify as Prolife and Prochoice are nearly tied](https://www.statista.com/statistics/225975/share-of-americans-who-are-pro-life-or-pro-choice/) with 49% of people identifying as prochoice and 47% identifying as prolife. 

[Despite this, 70% of Americans claim to not want Roe v Wade overturned](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/) oddly enough. 

[Governor Abbott is currently mostly unapproved of, but it is likely because of his poor handling of COVID, not the abortion ban](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-gov-greg-abbotts-approval-plummets-54-now-believe-state-wrong-track-1630609). That is more unpopular outside of Texas than inside of it. 

##By Race and Religion

Recent polling suggests that Whites and Hispanics are roughly [tied on views on abortion](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-race-and-ethnicity/) (within statistical margin of error). Blacks and Asians are by far the most pro-choice of the minority groups polled. 

Blacks have however rapidly shifted their views on abortion. Shifting from [majority pro-life to majority pro-choice within a decade](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/318932/black-americans-abortion.aspx).

[White Catholics are less likely to be pro-life than Hispanic Catholics](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2019/08/13/abortion-hispanic-and-white-catholics-differ-their-views) interestingly. This could be because being Catholic is more of a religious default for Hispanics. 

[White Evangelicals are by far the most pro-life major religious group](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/), Catholics are actually more likely to believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases than illegal in all/most cases. White Evangelicals being overwhelmingly prolife makes sense because they were the faction that lead the charge against abortion in the first place, and it’s still a major key issue for them. 

##By Trend

It’s often said that approval of abortion is basically the same as it was in the 90’s, and [that’s basically true](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion/iframe/). However, this is because the prochoice movement is mostly recovering from its disastrous public support in the 2000’s. In the year 2008, people saying that Abortion should be “illegal in most or all cases” was only 3% lower than “Legal in most or all cases), which is abortions’ lowest level of support in any recent year. 

However, the Prochoice movement began a renaissance in the year 2016, with abortion legality over double digit support over making it illegal. The highest support in recent years is 61% in 2019. For comparison, it was 60% in 1995. 

Currently, 59% of the country thinks Abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 39% of the country thinks it should be illegal in most or all cases. 

[Going by specific position](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-detailed/iframe/), 25% of adults believe that abortion should be legal in all cases, 34% believe it should be legal in most cases, 26% believe it should be illegal in most cases, and 13% believe it should be illegal in all cases. The rest are unsure. 

##By Party Affiliation

I’m just going to say the very obvious; most Republicans want abortion to be illegal, most Democrats want abortion to be legal. Shocking huh? 

[By support of abortion of members of a certain party](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-party-identification/iframe/), 80% of Democrats believe that Abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 19% believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. 35% of Republicans believe that Abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 63% of republicans believe abortion should be illegal in most/all cases. So interestingly, Democrats are more pro-choice than republicans are pro-life. 

Very interestingly, self described moderate/lean republicans are more likely to [believe abortion should be legal in most/all cases than illegal in most/all cases](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-party-ideology/iframe/). That being said, the fact that the Republican base in general is 2/3rds prolife suggests the continued rapid erosion of the moderate Republican bloc. Make of that what you will. 

##By Gender

Very interestingly, Women are only [slightly more likely](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-gender/iframe/) than men on average to support abortion. 62% of women believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases, and 56% of men believe that abortion should be legal in most/all cases. That means women support abortion 6% more than men, which is only barely statistically significant. That’s very unusual for something that’s allegedly a “womens’ rights issue”. This is likely because for women, other identities (religion, race, age, party preference, etc.) are more likely to take priority over gender identity. 

##By Age 

Contrary to popular belief, the 65* age group is [more likely](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-age/iframe/) to support abortion than the 50-64 age group. This means the Baby Boomers are the most prolife living generation and not Silent Generation. Also to nobody’s surprise, Gen Z is the most prochoice generation by a long mile. 67% of people aged 18-29 believe abortion should be legal in most/all cases, and only 31% of them believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. 

##By Education

[No educational cohort has a majority pro-life population](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-education-level/iframe/). However, people with High School level of education or less are statistically tied in their support for abortion. 50% of them believe that abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 47% believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. For people with some College experience, support for abortion rises to 61%, and it’s 68% for college graduates. 

##In Conclusion

From these stats, I believe that while the prolife movement is a minority, they have become more devout in recent years, and have been heavily campaigning against abortion during the 2010’s. While the issue is still majorly important for the core Republican base, it’s also paradoxically losing steam relative to other major issues to the Republican base, such as Immigration and election integrity. This is because the prolife movement is extremely associated with the Evangelical movement, which has fallen to the wayside for the new Populist movement that has taken the Republican base by storm. 

This is also true for the Democrats who have lost interest in the issue since the early 2010’s, but have become re-enthused by the pass of the Texas abortion law. Since it is now a hot topic again, we should be seeing a backlash from both sides of the aisle.",t2_aw4gyd39,1633117526,prochoice

pro-choice arguments from faith,"obviously, there's a lot of christian or catholic anti-abortion sentiment. the church of satan's gotten some press lately about pushing how the texas ban goes against their religious freedom, and rabbis have done the same - how do you feel, if you're religious and passionate about this topic? as a jewish person, my thoughts on the matter are pretty well summarized in [this](https://www.jta.org/2021/09/03/opinion/my-abortion-was-a-blessing-as-a-rabbi-i-will-fight-for-others-to-be-able-to-make-their-own-sacred-choice) article and a couple of other pro-choice jewish zines or pieces i've seen - in this case:

""Chayeiha kodmin l’chayyav, her life comes before that of the fetus.

What does it mean that the life of the pregnant person comes before that of the fetus? Over the centuries, various rabbinic authorities have offered their answers. It means that her physical needs and pain levels are prioritized over the birthing of the child (Rabbis Josef Trani and Jacob Emden). It means that her mental health is prioritized over the birthing of the child (Rabbi Mordecai Winkler). It means that her dignity and her honor are prioritized over the birthing of the child (Rabbi Ben-Zion Ouziel). It means that the primary consideration in the Jewish question of abortion is the needs of the person giving birth, their life, their health and their dignity.""

i don't know. i wanted to hear other people's thoughts, because - and i think rightly so, given the way evangelicalism especially has restricted choice in this matter - there can be a lot of distrust towards religion in pro-choice communities. i'm just curious if anyone else supports abortion rights at least in part from a place of faith.",t2_6aattcbj,1633063900,prochoice

How my cat lmk I needed an abortion,"I just want to share since all the shit going on today has been making me think about it a lot. 

2015- abusive relationship. BC fail. My skin looked a little *”brighter”(?)* one morning, but that was the only new/different thing.

That evening, I noticed my cat had a sudden behavior change towards me. **Super clingy**. Had to be resting on me and laying a paw across me. Never did before.

Googled. Many things popped up, but because the worst thing was being pregnant (and my skin was weird), I took a test. Shit… Planned parenthood in the next few days. Shit… yay only 6 wks! Or 5, idr I just know it was really early.

Had my medication abortion that next week! Had none of the monster cramps. It was very easy. Quick. Able to save up and escape DB, aka *douche bag*. 

Pets can tell. Thank goodness mine told me 🥰 

I got lucky, but today I would not have been. And I caught it early! I’d have been killed by him by now, if I had a baby and couldn’t save up and couldn’t leave. Definitely would have taken longer to leave if I couldn’t abort, which would have been a long enough delay I wouldn’t be here today.",t2_47mcn020,1633026276,prochoice

"300,000 petition signatures delivered to Senate for the protection of abortion rights under federal law","BY: [**Marlee Kokotovic**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/marlee-kokotovic/) \- September 30, 2021

Read the full article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/30/300000-petition-signatures-delivered-to-senate-for-the-protection-of-abortion-rights-under-federal-law/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/30/300000-petition-signatures-delivered-to-senate-for-the-protection-of-abortion-rights-under-federal-law/)

Yesterday, six advocacy groups delivered 300,000 petition signatures to the U.S. Senate demanding they protect and defend the right to abortion under the federal law. 

According to [Common Dreams](https://minordissent.substack.com/p/burgundy-pill-plate-spinning-is-antisocial?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNDg1MjQ3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0MTU5MjM0OSwiXyI6Ii8yNk1NIiwiaWF0IjoxNjMyOTczOTgwLCJleHAiOjE2MzI5Nzc1ODAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zNzc2NTQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.kXgkZRWJvcJn4KT0ZYA8x_LS7JECtEDWTOKu8j_hqSQ), the petition delivery and press conference outside the U.S. Capitol came ahead of hundreds of marches planned for Saturday across the country. Organizers of the #RallyforAbortionJustice events are calling on members of Congress to pass both the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Act and the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA).

The [Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1692) would require coverage for abortion care through public health insurance programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as insurance plans for federal employees. Further, abortion care must be available at federal, and federally supported, health care facilities to individuals eligible for services at such facilities. Additionally, the bill prohibits federal, state, or local governments from restricting coverage for abortion care available through private health insurance plans.

The [Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA)](https://actforwomen.org/the-womens-health-protection-act/) would protect the right to access abortion care throughout the United States.

“Over the past several weeks, right-wing extremists have inched us closer and closer toward a society without the precedent of Roe v. Wade. Despite the Biden administration’s best efforts and legal challenges in several states, we cannot protect abortion access without federal protections like those in WHPA,” says Sonja Spoo, director of reproductive rights campaigns at UltraViolet.

“Enactment of the Women’s Health Protection Act is absolutely essential to the health, autonomy, and fundamental rights and dignity of America’s moms. Most women who choose abortion are moms, and we all have the right to make that intensely personal \[decision\] without intrusion from government,” says Ruth Martin, senior vice president of MomsRising.",t2_2chu0rj6,1633013721,prochoice

Is there any legal description defining the “exception for a woman’s health”?,"Hi everyone! I’m not sure where else to post this question. I have been wondering exactly what it means when it says a woman’s life is at risk. Who gets to decide this? I have to share my childhood story watching my mother with HG (hyperemesis gravidarum). 

If you have never experienced HG or seen someone with it, it is insane. Before I begin my mother’s story, please know she is pro choice. That being said, I consider her a saint. She is the kind of woman that would have 20 kids if she could. She loves children, is a preschool teacher, and volunteers to teach children with special needs in her spare time. So it’s an absolute crime she had HG, she genuinely planned to have 6 kids, and that number isn’t an exaggeration. I was her first born, and her easiest. She “only” lost 15 pounds in her pregnancy. When she had my brother, she began her pregnancy at 130 pounds and ended her pregnancy at 90. 

My little sister was even worse. I remember her just being gray and withered to the bone. She could barely open her eyes to speak to me. Because of her severe HG, she was on constant fluids with this pregnancy. This unfortunately led to a staph infection, which worsened the situation.

As an adult speaking on it later, she told me the most traumatic thing for her was that as a 6 year old, I crawled up to her and asked “Mommy…are you going to die?” And she answered truthfully; “I don’t know sweetheart”. I don’t remember this, but that sounds pretty horrifying and I wonder if this contributes to my lack of desire to have children. 

But…She lived. With her doctors recommendation, she gave up her dream to have six kids and decided to stay alive for the three she had. She’s doing great doing what she loves. My little sisters 19th birthday is next week.

However, during the pregnancy, it was really uncertain whether or not my mom would make it.. But…she DID live….but it was absolute torture and it was so close to her leaving behind two young children a husband clueless with young children. 

Where is the line drawn? Would my mother have qualified? Is there a guideline? Obviously I can’t imagine my life without my sister. But if there is another woman in my moms position without the desire, or if my mom had gotten pregnant again…where is the line drawn?? No one should have to be forced through what my mom went through…but is the fact people like her do survive enough for the anti choice people to force them??",t2_69mcb2k8,1632984431,prochoice

Abortion: Pro Life or Pro Choice. A defense of abortion.,"&amp;#x200B;

I beg of you, kind person, to read through my arguments for abortion, for I have read yours demonizing it. It’s common courtesy to show each other. I hope that this might change your mind, and if it doesn't, that's alright.  

 

1. You’re killing children/humans)

No I’m not. Let me ask you this. What counts as a human life? What makes a living thing human? Sentience. The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without a brain, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings. A fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of cells. A fetus is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell, outside of a woman’s body. So calling a fetus a human/child is dehumanizing towards actual humans with fully formed brains and sentience, the ability to think and feel, survive outside of a woman’s body and the awareness of self. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable outside of a woman’s body, when it cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It’s called bodily autonomy. And as such, the argument that a fetus is human so abortion should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic.

And if you're going to say that every fertilized egg counts for an individual sentient human being, and therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm fertilized an egg didn't become a sentient human being? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding. You literally don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, if that’s what you believe, you should start a petition to ban hysterectomies, as the sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg attaches itself the the uterus, if a woman has no uterus, then the fertilized egg passes through her. But sterilization isn’t banned. Why not? Why are people against abortion?

Why are people against the removal of a fertilized egg from the uterus? Why is it only when it’s attached to the body part of a woman, in a woman’s body, sucking and taking nutrients from the woman, that people are against the removal of it? Sexism is terrible and it ruins the lives of women every day. As a man, you might have the benefit of not noticing. Of not needing to care. But for millions of women every day, they don’t have that privilege.

2. (All life is important/precious/…)

So to be clear, you mean that all human life is important/precious, and you believe that a fetus is a human. Well, a fetus isn’t human. What counts as a human life, and what makes a living thing human, is sentience. \*cue my previous argument\* The ability to think and feel. The awareness of self. How do I know that? Well, we can legally pull the plug on people who are brain dead/on life support systems even though they’re part of the Homo Sapiens and have a heart beat because they are legally dead. Without a brain, without sentience, you have no cognitive function or awareness of anything. Even a plant would surpass a brain dead person's awareness of his/her surroundings. A fetus has neither sentience nor the ability to think and feel. It is also lacking the awareness of cells. A fetus is also not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body/uterus. A fetus cannot survive on its own without sucking a woman’s nutrients, without needing a woman to build it’s every cell, outside of a woman’s body. A fetus cannot survive on its own, as its own being. A baby/child can survive outside a woman’s body, on its own, as its own being. So calling a fetus a human/child is dehumanizing towards actual humans with fully formed brains and sentience, the ability to think and feel, survive outside of a woman’s body and the awareness of self. When the fetus has no mark of humanity, when it isn’t viable outside of a woman’s body, when it cannot survive on its own without relying on the woman to build it’s every cell, without sucking her nutrients and squishing her organs, it is nothing but a clump of cells. If she wants to kick it out of her body and uterus, she has every right to do so. It’s called bodily autonomy. And as such, the argument that a fetus is human so abortion should be illegal, is devoid of reason, humanity and logic.

3. ( But it’s against God/ It’s unholy)

So? Which God? Your god? Well, you do realize there’s a reason why the bible, or any religious scripture, isn’t used as laws and policies in the Government right? Just because something’s holy doesn’t mean it’s ethical, legal, or morally right. And just because something’s unholy doesn’t mean it’s unethical, illegal or amoral. Holiness isn’t a judge for morality. I could sacrifice a virgin or kill my firstborn son because God told me to, and that would be holy, but it wouldn’t be ethically, morally or legally right. You can have religion. You shouldn’t use religion to take away the freedom, free will and bodily autonomy of others. And besides, if your God is against bodily autonomy, free will, and promotes the oppression of women and anyone who doesn't follow him(lower case “h” on purpose) then maybe you shouldn’t follow him. After all, “Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and you will have made the world a better place.”I will say this again, don’t use your religious beliefs to take away the bodily autonomy and free will of others, particularly women in this case. Just because it’s a religious belief does not mean it’s morally ethically or legally right. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

4. (My body My Choice only makes sense if someone else’s life isn’t at stake)

“Someone’s life” First of all, let’s get the semantics right. A fetus isn’t someONE. It isn’t a human being. How do I know that? Because it doesn’t have sentience and it isn’t viable without a capable host. It cannot survive on its own, without sucking the nutrients of the host, without needing the host to build it’s every cell, and it cannot survive outside of the host, that is the woman. It cannot survive on it's own, outside of the woman's body, as it's own being. We can legally pull the plug on brain dead people because they don’t have any cognitive ability. They don’t think and they don’t feel. And on top of that, they cannot survive without a life support system. A fetus can’t think or feel and it doesn’t have sentience. A fetus is not yet viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive without sucking the woman’s nutrients, without her building it’s every cell, without being attached to her uterus, without taking up space in her body, without squishing her organs, and it cannot survive outside a woman’s body. A human can survive outside a woman’s body and has sentience. And Fun Fact, if my mother was in a car accident and desperately needed a blood transfusion to live… and I was the only person on Earth who could donate blood to save her, and even if donating blood is a relatively easy, safe, and quick procedure, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO GIVE BLOOD. Yes, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate blood if I don’t want to.

If my father needed a kidney transplant because he has kidney cancer on both his kidneys, and I was the only person on Earth with kidneys compatible with his, NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY TO GIVE UP ONE OF MY KIDNEYS. Even if the chance of me dying is low, even if I have two kidneys and am under anesthesia and feel no pain during the operation, even to save the life of a FULLY GROWN SENTIENT PERSON, it would be ILLEGAL TO FORCE ME to donate my kidney if I don’t want to. Yet in some countries, it’s perfectly legal to force a woman with an unwanted pregnancy to go through labor-a painful, arduous and gratuitous experience where the woman is completely awake and has to push a 8 pound baby out of her vagina- for a clump of cells that don’t think, feel or have sentience. See, we have this thing called “bodily autonomy”. It’s this cultural notion that a person’s control over their own body is above all important and must not be infringed upon.

We can’t even take LIFE SAVING organs from CORPSES unless the person the corpse once contained gave consent before their death. Even CORPSES have more bodily autonomy than women, and they aren’t even alive!

To tell people that they MUST sacrifice their body autonomy for 9 months against their will in an incredibly expensive, invasive, painful and difficult process to save a clump of cells that have no brain, sentience, awareness of self or feelings, (in the earlier stages of pregnancy where the vast majority of pregnancies are performed) is desperately unethical. Also, women do not “carry babies.” They build every single cell of the fetus’s body. Women are not passive vessels unencumbered by pregnancy. The fetus that is not yet viable without a capable host does not supersede the bodily autonomy of a sentient woman. You can’t even ask corpses to sacrifice their bodily autonomy to give up organs that they aren’t using anymore as their dead.

You’re asking people who can become pregnant to accept less bodily autonomy than we grant to a literal corpse.

5. (You had sex and this is your punishment)

Who are you to decide what my punishment is? To decide whether I should even have one? Saying that pregnancy is a punishment for sex and that the baby the woman is forced to birth is her punishment is so dehumanizing. Why should a child grow up under the care of someone who is unfit to be a parent? Why must the child live out his/her life negatively affected by not being wanted? That the sole purpose for his/her existence is to punish his/her biological mother? That’s just plain cruel. You’re ruining the life of the child and the woman who was forced to give birth to it. Also, what does your argument have to do with anything? I think it might even be an argument for the legalization of abortion. Sex isn’t unethical, amoral or illegal and therefore no punishment is necessary. The woman doesn’t deserve the punishment(having to give birth to a baby), the baby shouldn’t have to live out it’s life as a punishment and the woman can abort the non-sentient, non- self-aware fetus that is not yet viable without her body as it's host. Also, what you think is wrong does not supersede the woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. This is one of the flimsiest arguments I’ve ever heard.

6. a(You’re preventing someone from existing) b( What if your mom didn’t have you)

6a First of all, if you’re a woman, you’ll have millions of egg cells containing DNA, all with the potential of being fertilized. If you're a man, you have millions of sperm cells all with the potential of fertilizing. So according to your logic, if you don’t have millions of kids, you’re preventing millions of people from existing. Women who agree with this argument against abortion, please get pregnant at whatever age you start to menstruate and have a kid a year. Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, get knocked up each and every year of your life. If you start menstruating at 12, and die at 90, have at least 78 kids. But even then you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have all your eggs be fertilized. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! Men who agree with the argument against abortion, please get impregnate whomever and whoever you meet, even if they’re 11/12/13/14/15. Have sex unprotected with millions of women a year. Ensure they all get pregnant. Start doing that at 12.Don’t go to school, don’t live your life, knock up millions of women each year. According to your logic, if you don’t spend each and every moment of your time having unprotected sex, you’ll be preventing the existence of millions of kids, so that’s on you. It’s your fault you can’t live billions of years to have each sperm you produce fertilize one egg that’s your bad. FYI, like I said, you have millions of sperm. HoW DaRe YOu nOt haVe MilLiOns of kIdS? YoU arE PrEVentIng MilLions Of kIdS fRom ExiSting! \*end of me making fun of this argument\*. You can’t biologically have millions of kids, you’re just not meant to. And you're not preventing anyone from existing if you have an abortion, because they don’t exist. How can you prevent someone from not existing, IF THEY DON’T EXIST? You have millions of egg cells in your ovaries. Are you going to be pregnant and in labor each and every year until you die? But even then there are still millions of egg cells left unfertilized. So according your logic, unless you live millions of years, you’re preventing the existence of millions of children. Doesn’t that just seem stupid? Besides, like I said, you can't prevent someone from existing if they don’t exist.

6b . First of all, if my mom chose not to biologically have kids, she wouldn’t be preventing my existence because I wouldn’t exist. And since she didn’t know it would be me, (I didn’t even know I’d be me) theoretically, the baby she gave birth to decades ago could have been anyone from the future president of China, to a homicidal maniac. Also, I didn’t exist for billions of years. \*I’m going to go on a bit of a rant now\* I didn’t exist when I could die from simply going out of whatever shelter I lived in. I didn’t exist when the earliest settlers arrived in China, living in caves and hunting game, only to die from a little cut because antibiotics didn’t exist. I didn’t exist during various dynasties, when famine was always around the corner, poverty everywhere, and class differences huge. I didn’t exist during the 19th century when child labour was common place and even in Britain, child mortality rates where shockingly high. Also, people would taint milk with anything from lead to borax and you were lucky to have pond water in your milk. Also, I had pneumonia as a child and if I were born in the 19th and even 20th century, I would have died. I didn't exist during World War 1/2 and the NanKing massacre where millions of Chinese people died. I didn’t exist during The Great Famine when desperate people would resort to eating their dead in order to survive. I was born later on, with access to education, the internet and various luxuries like the air conditioner and an indoor bathroom. I am glad I didn’t exist for millions of years(even more if you’re counting the time before Homo Sapiens walked on the Earth). \*end of rant\*. My point is, I was born. I didn’t feel the pain of not existing for millions/billions of years, because I didn’t exist. If my mom chose not to have kids, I would feel nothing because I wouldn't exist. I would thank her for her choice if I were even around to care. She wouldn’t be preventing my existence, because I wouldn’t fricking exist. And therefore, you’re argument and weaponization of my mom is stupid. So those slogans that say “Your mom chose life, you should too” are stupid. Even if my mom didn’t choose to keep the non-sentient fetus not yet viable without sucking her nutrients and using her as it’s host, she wouldn’t be ending my life, because I didn’t exist. I wouldn’t even know because I wouldn’t be sentient enough to care. And also, even if she was preventing my existence by aborting the fetus, she isn’t ethically or morally wrong. It’s her body and it’s her choice. She has every right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

(You’re killing babies/ unborn child)

By saying “unborn child” you are insinuating that the fetus attached to the uterus of a woman, is infact a child that has yet to be born. I am here to argue that you are wrong in that assumption/insinuation. This is quite similar to the argument that fetuses are human beings. Please read my argument above opposing that idea.

Let’s get our semantics right. An unborn child isn’t a child, it’s a fetus. A baby/child is someone who can survive outside the woman’s body, without taking up her uterus, sucking her nutrients and doesn’t need her to grow anymore. A fetus is a fetal embryo not viable without a capable host. A fetus cannot survive on its own, as its own being. A baby/child can. 

Whatever your beliefs, a non-sentient, non-feeling, fetus that cannot survive outside a willing host does not supersede that of the woman with it in her uterus. The fetus is in her body, and cannot survive outside of her uterus. She has the bodily autonomy to decide whether or not to let it stay inside her uterus or abort it by removing it. The bottom line is this, when the fetus is born, it is out of the woman’s body, can survive on its own, as its own being and is therefore called a baby/child. The woman can’t abort a baby that is born, because it’s out of her body and is no longer sucking up her nutrients, and she is no longer building every cell of it. 

When it was in her body, she had the choice of either aborting it, or carrying it to term because it was IN her body, she had TO BUILD EVERY CELL OF IT, and had the choice of letting it stay, or removing it via abortion. It’s her body and it’s her choice. If she doesn’t want to play host to a clump of cells sucking her away at her nutrients, if she doesn’t want her ribcage to expand, her skin to stretch, her organs pushed and squished to make space for the fetus, if she doesn’t want to push out an 8 pound baby out, she has every right to remove it from her uterus. It’s called bodily autonomy and must not be violated. 

Once she decides to carry it to TERM, and it leaves HER BODY, able to live without squishing her organs, stretching her skin, causing her health problems, depending on her to build every part of her body and sucking her nutrients, she cannot “kill” it. As it no longer relies on her body for nutrients, no longer takes up space in her body and she doesn’t have to build every cell, she cannot say, stab it, because it’s no longer a matter of bodily autonomy. No one else can decide for her as it’s her body and her choice. A baby/child can survive on its own, as it’s own being without needing to be inside a host body. So once it’s out of the woman’s uterus and can survive without it, the woman cannot, say, abort it as it’s already outside her body. She cannot stab it as it's outside HER BODY, and can survive as it's own being. How is it that some people still fail to grasp this very simple concept?

 You can abort a fetus that’s in you, you can choose not to let it stay in your uterus. You can’t abort it once it's born because it’s no longer in your uterus, it no longer uses your body as it’s host and it can survive on its own outside it. So anyone who chooses to abort a fetus is not killing a baby, because a fetus isn’t one. They are choosing to not let the fetus stay in their body, its host, not killing a baby. Repeat after me, a baby/child can survive on it’s own outside a woman’s uterus, a fetus is a fetal embryo not yet viable without a capable host. When it is not yet viable without a capable host, that is the woman’s body(uterus), the woman has every right to choose to not let it remain in HER BODY. It’s called bodily autonomy. Once it’s out of her body, she cannot abort it, as it’s already out, and can survive without her body as its host. 

Think of it as a life support system. The fetus is essentially brain dead (no cognitive ability whatsoever) on a life support system that is the body of the woman, and she has every right to take it off its life support system that’s essentially her body. Once the fetus no longer needs the life support system to survive, and exits her body, she cannot take it off the life support system as it no longer needs it. It’s the same with late term abortions. The fetus still doesn’t have any cognitive ability whatsoever, and is on a life support system that is the woman, and she can choose to take it off it’s life support system that’s her body. 

I don’t get the controversy around late term abortions. The fetus still can’t survive outside the uterus, the fetus still requires a host that is the woman, and the woman has every right to her bodily autonomy, and remove it from her body if she doesn’t want to play host. And it’s quite clear that people understand the difference between a fetus and a baby. What counts as a baby/child isn’t it’s heartbeat, or it’s brain, it’s whether or not it can survive on its own outside a woman’s body, as its own being, without needing a woman to be it’s host and build every cell of its body. If it needs to be inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus, sucking HER nutrients, squishing HER organs and need HER to build every cell of its body, it is not a baby/child, it’s a fetus that is not yet viable without a host, inside a woman’s body attached to HER uterus. And if she wants to abort it, if she doesn’t want to let it stay inside HER BODY, she has the bodily autonomy to abort it by medically removing it from HER uterus and HER body. The non-sentient non feeling and non-self aware fetus that is not yet viable without a willing host, does not supersede that of the woman with it in Her Body. If you had a petri dish with a fetus in one hand, and a baby in another, and you were forced to drop one, I think you would choose to drop the petri dish. She cannot abort a born baby, because it’s OUT of her body, and no longer needs her as it’s host to survive. She cannot stab it, because it's out of HER BODY and can SURVIVE ON IT'S OWN, AS IT'S OWN BEING. This is a matter of bodily autonomy and women’s rights. The non sentient fetal embryo that cannot survive without its life support system, that's the woman, isn’t more important than a sentient woman with the ability to think and feel. I don’t know why people believe otherwise.

Just because you don’t like late term abortions/abortions doesn’t mean it’s ethically, morally or legally wrong. Just because you don't like it isn’t a good enough reason to restrict women’s right to their bodily autonomy. For example, I despise dogs. I know, a controversial opinion. I rather like cats. But just because I don’t like dogs doesn’t mean I have the right to restrict/prevent people from getting one. Your beliefs do not supersede a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy. Please read my argument no. 4.

(But...but a child was once a fetus)

Just because a child was once a fetus, doesn’t mean a fetus is the same as a child. Please read my argument above on why  a fetus isn’t a child, and why it’s ethical to have an abortion. Please read argument number 6 where I argue that aborting a fetus doesn't mean you’re preventing the existence of a child. And I implore you, kind human, to read argument number 4 on why it’s doesn’t matter if abortions prevents the existence of a child.

Abortion should be legal and destigmatized. Your beliefs, religious or not, do not supersede a sentient woman’s right to her bodily autonomy.

How can I make this decision and know it’s the right one ?,"So about a month ago I found out I was pregnant (with a failed Plan B) by my ex boyfriend, who I have been on and off with since the beginning of the year when we officially broke up, after seriously dating and being together for two years prior. 
He completely does not want to be with me, has been very on and off about how he feels about my pregnancy. His initial reaction was blaming me , telling me how stupid I am, he feels betrayed by me, and I can’t do this to him. That I better get an abortion. We were in a time of no contact (due to him wanting to be single and cutting communication with me out of his life) when he found out I was pregnant. After his initial rude reaction, I ended up seeing him so we could talk, and he wanted to “bond” with the baby, holding me, rubbing my belly, leading me on. Then he started acting distant again, cut me out of his life again, made me leave the apartment, even hit me once and pushed me down and threw stuff on top of me, knowing I was pregnant. As of this past month, we went no contact, I see he’s out living his best life with friends, traveling to Vegas, all while not checking on me at all. Then one night he starts blowing my phone up asking about me and the baby, demanding that we talk and see each other and he was complaining that “I never tell him anything or reach out anymore” when he’s the one that cut me off.. I was distant towards him, and then the other night he called me crying, I come to find out that he was crying over ANOTHER girl, asking for my comfort, he wants to see me, he was crying telling me he doesn’t want me to get an abortion, we’re both going to regret it forever and I need to see him before I go and do it. I never did, because he made me feel like trash and like I was just an option and it disgusts and hurts me that he has moved on to sleep around with other people already. The next day, I guess he came to his senses, he told me he was just sad and drunk and that he “never said that he didn’t want me to get the abortion” which is totally fcking gaslighting me because he definitely said it. 
Point is, I feel like I’m at difficult point in my life, I don’t know if I can raise or be financially stable enough to support a baby on my own, but I also KNOW the guilt will eat me alive for aborting my baby. Although we aren’t together anymore, he still is someone that was once (and still) dear to my heart, no matter what abuse or cheating or pain he caused me unfortunately. The fact that we made a baby together, it’s literally growing inside of me more and more every day literally kills me and I don’t think I’ll be able to pull thru an abortion. I’m scared I’m not ready and it’s going to be a mistake having a baby, but I feel like aborting it will take an even bigger toll on me and I will suffer eternally from it. I don’t know what to do. Please someone help me find some clarity. I know it’s my choice I’m just so scared because both decisions are SO hard. Btw I’m around 8-9 weeks, and 25 years old. 

Side note- if I WERE to get an abortion, I was considering the “medication abortion” which is taking the pills to induce a miscarriage, but the fact that I’m basically in charge of this procedure feels so wrong. Like I’m deciding the time when my baby is going to die and after the pills I just have to wait for it to happen. It feels so wrong to me. I also am aware that I am running out of time to have an abortion. 

I am 100% pro choice, I just don’t think I can personally have an abortion myself because my guilt eats me alive and I tend to regret easily or dwell on the past and what if’s a lot.

Subject: A message from Senator Charles E. Schumer

To: &lt;&gt;

Dear Mr. H:

Thank you for expressing your support for women's reproductive rights. I wholeheartedly agree with you that women's reproductive decisions are personal decisions, and should not be dictated by the government or interest groups.

Throughout my career, I have been a strong advocate of protecting a woman's right to choose. Because of that commitment to choice, NARAL Pro-Choice America has given me a 100% lifetime rating. You can be confident that in the Senate I will continue to be a vigilant advocate for preserving a woman's right to choose.

Again, thank you for contacting me. Please keep in touch with your thoughts and opinions.

Sincerely,

Charles E. Schumer

United States Senator

The vote to “protect the right to abortion across the country” is the first legislation of its kind that is specifically designed to protect the right to abortion access nationwide.

The bill, H.R. 3755, passed in a 218-211 vote. It will counteract abortion bans such as the S.B. 8 in Texas as well as one in Mississippi’s, which will be heard by the Supreme Court this year.

“The House has stepped in where the courts have failed us,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said. “This historic vote is the first time legislation has advanced in Congress to establish a right to abortion. Now the Senate must act or the current crisis on abortion access in Texas could reverberate across large swaths of the nation.”

According to a poll conducted by Hart Research Associates, a majority of voters (61 percent) want a nationwide federal law protecting abortion rights to override restrictive abortion laws at the state level.

“At a time when states like Texas have heightened attacks on reproductive justice, it is imperative that the federal government steps in to defend abortion care across our nation,” Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director at URGE: Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity, said. “The Women’s Health Protection Act is a crucial step toward making abortion access a reality.”

The Women’s Health Protection Act was introduced in the House by U.S. Representatives by; Judy Chu (D-CA), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and in the Senate by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). As of current, the bill has 47 co-sponsors in the Senate.

“Along with ending abortion coverage bans and ensuring access for young people who need abortion, passing WHPA gets us closer to a day when our decisions are truly our own,” Inez McGuire said.",t2_2chu0rj6,1632770946,prochoice

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1632729617,prochoice

Anyone ever been to the anatomy museum in Riga?,"So this weekend I took a little trip up to Latvia with some friends.  One wanted to check out this medical anatomy museum so I tagged along.  On the bottom floor they have an exhibit of newborn babies/fetuses who developed the most horrific birth defects you can ever imagine.  I’m not a physician so I can’t tell you what these medical conditions are, but even the most horrific things you can think of don’t come close.  One of these babies had a head that was not properly developed and looked a little like yoda from Star Wars.  One had an object sticking out of the abdomen, another with what looked like a second brain attached outside the head. I could go on and on but the fact that Republicans and pro lifers want to force women to carry fetuses which will turn into babies such as the ones I just mentioned is beyond disgusting.  My heart goes out to each and every one of those infants displayed in that museum as well as their families.  No one should have to carry a fetus in that type of condition to term.

"I emailed Susan Collins, senator of Maine, who is opposed to the WHPA","(Upon reading this news article, [Sen. Susan Collins won’t support abortion rights bill](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-09-22/sen-susan-collins-says-she-would-oppose-abortion-rights-bill))

*Dear Senator Collins,*

*I hope this letter finds you well.*

*I am writing to you in regards to the Women's Health Protection Act that is to come before the Senate floor.* 

*It has come to my attention that you have expressed opposition to this bill and I wish to address some of your concerns and perhaps shed a different perspective on them.* 

*In regards to your concern for the weakening of conscientious exemptions and RFRA, abortion rights are on life support in America right now.*

*While the rights of certain providers may or may not be effected by this bill, it is not the most pressing concern we have right now due to things like SB8 and the precipice of the overturning of Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization case set to be heard by SCOTUS this December.*

*Surely we can address the issue of potential interference with RFRA at a later time.*

*Anti-abortion supporters do not typically care about a pregnant person's request for alleviation from a pregnancy that has already occurred, and so, taking a page from their very own playbook, I fail to see why their alleviation should rise to our top concern in regards to this bill.* 

*But the fact of the matter is that the current state of abortion rights absolutely is interfering with conscientious objection: those of the providers who wish to provide abortion care. There are providers all across the country, especially in the state of Texas, that are unable to provide the care that they wish to, despite objections to abortion restrictions and outright bans.* 

*Where is the concern for their conscientious objections?*

*The amount of providers that may be effected by the passing of this bill is nothing in comparison to those who would be effected by not passing this bill.*

*And more importantly, the sheer volume of women, of pregnant people, who are in desperate need of protections to a vital component of their healthcare, should be our main concern.*

*Mrs. Collins, I ask you, what about their rights?*

*Lastly, I would like to address what appeared to me to be a concern of yours in regards to post viability abortions. Abortions on viable fetuses past 24 weeks.*

*There is a fallacious assumption that has been perpetuated by the anti-abortion propaganda that women wait months and months to obtain abortions on then viable pregnancies. That they just change their mind at 8 or 9 months because they had a party to go to.*

*Women don't typically just change their minds or have abortions on viable pregnancies. For the few that do, we need to examine the reasoning why, and it's usually never because they ""changed their mind."" Perhaps they had been raped and unable to cope with the rape, let alone the resultant pregnancy (as was a story told in the documentary ""After Tiller."") Perhaps they were in an abusive situation, carrying a pregnancy due to will or fear of their abuser, and, upon breaking free, finally felt they could escape their pregnancy and opted for an abortion so they (and the resultant child) did not have to be tied to their abuser forever.* 

*Regardless of yours or my personal feelings towards their fetus, can you, in good conscious, say that these people had a time limit on their abuse and trauma, on their rights to their own bodies, and disallow them access to the care that they need?* 

*We should provide better abuse intervention so that people do not wind up in these situations. Provide them with access to services that will keep them and their child out of their abusers reach should they choose to carry to term. But we should not remove the option of abortion, trapping her even further. She needs to feel that she can take on the task and can do so of her own free will - making the decision for her will not empower her. And we know that poverty has an impact on the cycle of abuse; being disallowed access to abortion can and will increase these people's likelihood of remaining in poverty.*

*In closing, any conscientious objections that might occur should be dealt with at a later point in time and I urge you to provide support of the WHPA, now, while abortion rights still exist, if even in name only. The anti-abortion movement has long since refused to acknowledge our conscientious objections to abortion bans; we need to triage the conscientious objections of abortion providers, as well as the sheer magnitude of patients, at this moment in time.* 

*Thank you*

Two other democratic senators have not signed onto the bill: Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the latter of which is strongly opposed to abortion rights.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) is also likely to be supportive but could just as easily not be.

These people would be good candidates to contact, or perhaps even just your state Republican senators. I don't think they even necessarily have to be your state senator - an email to any of them that you think could be swayed, could make a difference.

ABOLISH the Filibuster and PASS The Women's Health Protection Act -- NOW!!!!

**BODY COPY:**

The House just passed the Women’s Health Protection Act which would guarantee a person’s right to an abortion throughout the US.

That’s why it’s more important than ever to abolish the filibuster so the Women’s Health Protection Act can pass the Senate and get to President Biden’s desk.

The oppressive Texas anti-abortion law has taken effect and states like Florida are already planning on copying it. It’s more important than ever to make sure a person’s right to abortion is protected on the federal level.

Abortion bans are state-sanctioned violence. They’re about controlling people’s bodies and lives, especially people of color and low-income folks.

"Why I left the debate sub- no brigading, I’m just sharing my experience there.","Fair warning - I definitely swore a lot and I am not surprised at all that it was removed but this is how I was feeling at the time and it is authentic to my experience in the sub and the level of disrespect and inappropriate behavior from mostly PL people.

Text from post:

I’m done with the sub, and I’d recommend any pro-choice person who actually gives a fuck about the debate to leave the sub as well because it’s a fucking farce to give any of this “pro life” ideology any fucking credential or respect or dignify it with a response. 

Male people with male reproductive organs are never going to be affected by anti-abortion laws. These laws may be written to apply to everyone but they’re only actually going to apply to one group of people on the basis of sex. You can claim it’s not discrimination in theory, but the practice clearly shows that it is.

I care about the consequences not the fucking stated intent of your political ideology. The consequences will only ever affect female people with female reproductive organs. That is sex based oppression, no matter how much you want to deny it. 

I am not going to debate my rights with people whose rights will never be taken away on the basis of biological sex. 

I will not be sacrificed on the altar of your ideology.

It is not worth dignifying the posts that I’ve seen this week with any sort of fucking response, and I regret ever engaging with the type of people that would say the stuff I’ve seen this week. 

Rape apologists and racists, anti semitism and transphobia. It’s sickening what I’ve seen here. 

I hope y’all have fun in your cesspool.



Note: I do wish that I had waited until I was calmer and more articulate. I had just been engaged in two or three different conversations, one of them with the moderator of that sub, where the blatant lies about the consequences of p life ideology were so disrespectful and so frustrating that I could not hold back. I wish I had offered more examples, but I don’t think that would’ve made a difference in whether the poster made up or not considering that the moderator is one of the people who is a problem and is contributing to that behavior.


Some of the examples of inappropriate behavior I saw that was tolerated (or perpetrated) by the mod of the sub:

- Using trans people as pawns to argue abortion laws aren’t sexist, which is disrespectful to trans men and other afab people who are effected by sex based oppression
- claiming rape victims are living a “risky lifestyle”
- claiming that forcing a child rape victim to carry a fetus to term is not callous
- claiming that women who have abortions or want abortions are evil, irresponsible, sluts..etc
- claiming abortions are racist (while ignoring the maternal mortality rate for black women)
- asking a victim of forced pregnancy is she was “tied down” 
- using Holocaust survivors as pawns to argue against abortion, which is disrespectful to the Jewish faith and those of us who are only here bc our female ancestors managed to abort fetuses conceived by rape perpetrated by Nazis
- comparing abortion to slavery bc it’s “devaluing the fetus like black peoples were devalued,” which disrespects how reproductive slavery and abuse has been used against black people and particularly black women
- making up insane caricatures of evil women to argue against abortion


Those are just a few of the examples that were allowed to fly in that sub. As you can imagine, I don’t approve of this kind of behavior And I don’t think it should be welcome in any civilized debate sub.

I’m including all of this information here not to draw any attention to myself; there are many other people who commented or have left the sub for the same reasons I did. I just think it’s really important to look at the behavior that is allowed or encouraged as a whole, and we can then make decisions about which people, which subs, and which conversations we engage with. There is some behavior that is so inappropriate that it should not be allowed on any sub and particularly not on a debate sub, where emotional tension is already high and the outcomes of ideology has a direct impact on the rights of living people.",t2_5kwcwner,1632499413,prochoice

People who are not doctors and provide abortion pills by mail to Texans, will face up to a $10k fine and 2 years in prison. 

I think Texas will come after the use of emergency contraceptives next, before working on making regular contraceptives inaccessible.

Texas is becoming more horrifying by the day. My heart aches for girls/ women/AFAB people in the US right now. Florida is currently working on introducing the same bounty bill as Texas, and I am sure they will not be the only state to do so. It seems like nowhere is safe from the anti-abortion tyranny. 

I am dreading the effects of these laws coming to light. It's pretty clear to me that the maternal mortality and morbidity rate will rise in states with restrictive laws, and I am willing to wager that the infant mortality rate will rise too. Not just because people will end up maimed or dead from clandestine abortions (which they will), but also because people will die or be injured because they are forced to carry a pregnancy to term that is either already unsafe, or will become unsafe. 

[This article is a good read.](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits)

From the article:

-Carrying a pregnancy to term is 33 times riskier than having an abortion, with 0.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 abortions compared to 20.1 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

-The study estimated that in the years following a national ban, an additional 140 women would die annually from pregnancy-related causes, bringing the death toll to 815, a 21% increase. Among non-Hispanic Black women, pregnancy-related deaths would increase by a third.

"Thoughts on ""pro-lifers"" who have had abortion/s - prolife hypocrisy","Imo they can't be pro-life.

It's like a paedophile promoting anti-padeophilia.

Literally insane, hypocritical.

""MY ABORTION IS THE ONLY MORAL ABORTION"".

These kinds of people think they are superior and above everyone else. They talk down to everyone else and bully them about their sex life and try to control them. It has been described that these kinds are rude and disrespectful in the clinic when getting their abortion with thw very people helping them. Then not long after are back outside protesting and harassing women outside the clinic. The Typical Christian Karens.

Despite pl beliefs wanting to actually treat those who have abortions like criminals and murderers, they actively idolize post abortive women who claim to ""regret"" the abortion. They idolize these women and put them at the forefront of their movement (Abby Johnson). They face no punishment or anything for what they did. Which is again, inconsistent with pl beliefs. Many pl want women to be imprisoned if they have had abortions and treated like criminals. Yet they treat these supposed ""baby killers"" like Johnson like their Saviors. Its illogical.

They also idolize abortionists who claim to now be prolife. Personally I believe they mainly do it for the money and fame but ok.
This is extremely inconsistent with their beliefs, many want abortionists jailed - yet they idolize ones who merely claim to be pl - as they explain in detail the abortion procedures. As having done thousands themselves. They have these people also at the forefront of their movement. Recognising no hypocrisy of any sort.
They see these people as serial killers yet as soon as they utter the word ""pro-life"", seemingly all the thousands of killed fetuses is forgotten and forgiven!!

Off the deep end,"Me: You know exactly why what you’re doing is discriminatory

Mod: No, I know why you want to believe it is discriminatory.  To me, the law applies to everyone.  Biology might prevent that from happening to a man, but if it somehow did permit it, I would insist on every man being subject to it as well.

And now that we have more accepted transmen out there, the biology itself has ceased to actually be a limiting factor.  If you accept them as men, then you accept that they are covered by anti-abortion law just like a woman would be, because while they might be men, they have the necessary biology.

If the law was actually discriminatory based on gender, they would get a pass.

They don't.  Why?  Because the problem isn't that they are women or men, the issue is that no matter what sex or gender you are, abortion on demand is wrong.

Discrimination is a pure red herring.  Those people who say that if men could get pregnant they would all be pro-choice?  Those people are delusional.  We already have pro-life women, why would we not also have pro-life men if they could also get pregnant.

You are suggesting that fertile women or any fertile person with female reproductive organs is not allowed medical treatment on the basis that she may become pregnant.

You know full well that is not what is being said here.  The problem isn't ""medical treatment"" it is that the treatment in question affects someone else.

You're welcome to end the conversation here, but from my perspective all you're doing is putting your hands over your ears when you meet with a perspective that doesn't match yours.

Me: Sex based oppression. Sex based discrimination.

Oppression on the basis of biological sex. Discrimination of the basis of biological sex.

We are not talking about gender, we are talking about laws that effect only one biological sex.

That is by definition discriminatory.

It is not merely my opinion that it is discriminatory.

It is a fact that when you make a law that applies to only one group of people on the basis of an immutable characteristic about that group of people, you are discriminating against that group of people.

You are welcome to argue that in this case you believe that the discrimination is ethical or should be legal or whatever. But denying that it is discrimination is simply not truthful.

If I wrote a law that only applied to people who produce sperm, limiting their basic human rights, that law would be discriminatory, because I’m writing it specifically to target a group of people for an immutable characteristic.

For example, if I wrote a law that required all people who produce sperm to get vasectomies, then that law would be discriminatory and it would be sex-based oppression and a violation of their basic human rights.

You have argued that fertile people with female reproductive organs should be denied medication’s or treatment that would affect a future pregnancy. That is sex-based discrimination. That is not just my opinion. That is simply factual based on what the definition of discrimination is; the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex.

Supreme Court has set a date to hear Mississippi’s abortion case,"BY: [**Amanda Mills**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/amanda-mills/) \- September 21, 2021

Read the full article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/21/supreme-court-has-set-a-date-to-hear-mississippis-abortion-case/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/21/supreme-court-has-set-a-date-to-hear-mississippis-abortion-case/)

The Supreme Court will begin hearing oral arguments for Mississippi’s *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* case starting December 1, 2021. What is to be determined is if state laws that ban pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional.

“The fate of Roe v. Wade and legal abortion is on the line,” tweets Rewire News Group.

This case has the potential to pose a serious challenge to *Roe v. Wade*. That’s the 1973 ruling that declared that a woman has a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy in the first six months of her pregnancy, when the fetus is incapable of surviving outside the womb, reports [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/20/1038972266/supreme-court-date-roe-wade-dobbs-jackson-womens). 

In the state of Mississippi, most abortions are banned after 15 weeks. According to AP, the state has told the court it should overrule Roe and the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that prevents states from banning abortion before viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The court’s recent approval to allow a Texas law to go into effect that bans abortions after 6 weeks when cardiac activity can be detected, has many activists and lawmakers nervous as to how Mississippi’s hearings will go. The court did not rule Texas’ abortion law as constitutional or unconstitutional but rather declined to intervene. 

Mississippi’s restriction makes no exception for pregnancies that result from rape or incest and providers who administer abortions in violation of the law could have their medical licenses revoked and face fines, writes [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/09/20/supreme-court-announces-date-case-directly-challenging-roe-v-wade). 

As pointed out by NARAL Pro-Choice America, this will be the first abortion case in the Supreme Court since Justice Amy Coney Barrett had been appointed by former President Donald Trump. 

&gt;🚨 BREAKING: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on December 1. This is the case that directly asks [\#SCOTUS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCOTUS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to overturn Roe—and it’s the first abortion case to be heard since Amy Coney Barrett replaced RBG on the bench.

As reported by [The Guardian,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/20/us-supreme-court-mississippi-roe-v-wade) nearly 900 state legislators from 45 states had filed a brief with the supreme court, asking it to reject the Mississippi law.

I can't imagine a world without abortion.,"TW: Mentions of sexual assault

I am a minor and I've been getting really paranoid about rape. I've never been sexually assaulted before and I am constantly afraid that someone will. It's gotten to the point where I biked down a dark road and almost cried in the shower afterwards. I've started thinking about what would happen if I get pregnant at this age, and I'm absolutely paranoid about it. I don't want to be an incubator for a child that I never wanted. I don't care about the Miracle of Life and I don't want to be forced into it. I want to grow up and have a child on my own terms. I don't understand what's so hard for others to accept about that.",t2_97bthmgo,1632189409,prochoice

When are you pro-choice?,"If you ask people what the terms pro-choice and pro-life mean, most will say pro-choice people support safe legal access to abortion and pro-life people oppose it. But because this isn't a black and white issue, which label would someone use if they (as I suspect most people do) believe abortion is okay up until a certain stage of pregnancy and then is immoral and should be illegal afterwards? Of course anyone can call themselves whatever they want, but I'm asking about the common definition. I'm sure there is an easy answer but I wasn't able to find it. Thanks.

My abortion story,"I was 21 on a trip to another state to see this guy. I came there knowing I was probably going to sleep him. I came with a friend, got blackout drunk and he took off the condom. The trip itself was bad because of a bunch of drama that happened. I quit talking to my “friend” who brought me on the trip, I quit talking to the guy, but a few weeks later I started to lose weight and get sick. I started to gag at everything, getting hot flashes, I hadn’t gotten my period, I was puking all the time. I was lazy and thought it was just my mental health which had made me sick in a similar way before, just without the hot flashes and my periods had been irregular before, so I didn’t go to the doctor for a while. It wasn’t until my counselor started suggesting I was pregnant that I decided to get tested. I went  to my local women’s clinic where they tested me and did my first Pap smear. Right away they came back and said it was positive. I was honestly shocked for some reason. I mean we had used a condom as far as I knew at the time. They took me back and did the ultrasound and I told them right away I would get an abortion. They told me because of the way I reacted to the Pap smear that I wouldn’t be able to take the pain of a medical abortion or take having a surgical abortion awake, so they referred me to another clinic out of state to have an abortion under anesthesia. Right away I felt panicked at the thought of this. How was I going to pay for this? Who was going to go with me if I had to be under anesthesia? I was 7 weeks along and contacted the out  of state clinic right away. I had to fill out some paperwork online and make an appointment. After that my counselor luckily started to help me look for abortion support groups to help me pay for it. Several told me that wouldn’t serve my area and others told me there was process and they would only pay up to 75 dollars. The abortion would be $695. I called around some more and found a group that would pay up to half, but they wanted me to do it their way meaning that they wanted me to go somewhere cheaper like planned parenthood where they wouldn’t put me under. That or they wanted me to  do a medical abortion. I told them I wouldn’t and that I would put it on a credit card before I did that. They argued with me, but eventually called the gyno I went to themselves and he told them why I needed an abortion under anesthesia. I’m the meantime, I started looking for people to drive me. I called some of the only people I could think of. I texted my old social worker from fostercare. Immediately she asked me “what about adoption? What if you give it up to someone you love and trust?” I asked her who the fuck that was and she said “well if you’ve made up your mind”. She said she couldn’t take me because it was during the beginning of Covid and she said she couldn’t go out of state. Next I called my other old social worker from when I was in fostercare who had become like my second mom. Immediately she started to interrupt me, told me to calm down, said let her process this. Asked me who I had gotten pregnant by. She started saying things like don’t make a rash decision, don’t jump to a decision that I usually had a hard time making small decisions and how could I know what to do for such a big thing. She asked to talk later and I agreed, but she pissed me off. Fast forward to later, We meet at a yogurt shop of all places, where she wanted to meet to have this talk. She starts asking me why I won’t consider an open adoption. I told her because open adoptions topically end within the first 5 years, because I lived in fostercare and lived with families who adopted children who treated them nothing like the biological kids, who treated them like trash. Because I couldn’t stand the pain of giving my child up for adoption which studies show is a life long trauma, because i didn’t want to continue the cycle of fostercare/adoption as many people who lived in fostercare lose their children to fostercare or adoption. Because I had lived with a family who scapegoated the foster kids, who I knew would get rid of their young adopted children as soon as they turned teens and started doing normal teen things, as soon as they weren’t cute and little anymore. She looked at me and said “but you don’t know that you don’t know how you’ll feel until you’re there, until you do it. There are good fosterparents and good adoptive parents” and we started argue and then she started to cry and I asked her why she was so hellbent on me having a child and giving it up for adoption. She said, because “I wish to adopt one day” and cried. I stared at her and in me I knew that I never wanted to give birth no matter what, no matter who said they would take the child, how good of a life they said they would give it. I didn’t care, I wasn’t sacrificing myself for someone else and I wasn’t to give my child up for adoption to this woman trying to manipulate me into something I didn’t want. Fast forward a couple of days and the abortion group called me back, they told me they would help me get an abortion, pay for it all and arrange me a ride. I got the abortion, but again something sat so wrong with me about how Amy tried to manipulate me. I didn’t talk to her for several weeks and then I decided I would tell her how I felt. We sat down to have dinner and I had so much built up emotion. How dare she attempt to manipulate me into having an open adoption? I asked her what her intentions were and why attempted so hard to get me to do that and I asked her if she was trying to adopt the child that would’ve come to be. She said no, that she wasn’t ready for a child yet. After all that she wasn’t even volunteering to take the child like if you didn’t want me to have the abortion so much then put your life and your money where your mouth is. She said the way I was talking to her and looking at her, it was like I wasn’t even considering her and to her that was like she said that I was almost implying she wouldn’t be a good mother??? I told her that was irrational and she agreed. If I were to have kept that baby or given a baby up for adoption I would have needed so much emotional support, so much help so much love and you know what? I told her that if I had kept that baby, she would have to be like a very involved grandma or aunt, she would have to babysit while I was at work, at school, help me with diapers and money and you know what she did, she laughed. She laughed in my face. She said she would have to pray because being in a child’s  life is a huge deal. The hypocrisy. I still have dinner with her every Thursday and I have no idea why. She tried to convince me to literally ruin my life. And there’s a lot of things I didn’t put in here about her that would’ve made her even worse in this scenario. I’m blessed to have had that abortion.",t2_4grcvr9x,1632153011,prochoice

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1632124813,prochoice

6. in that case, being a sperm donor is the only purpose of a man. being a parent is not the sole purpose of anyone. and what about men and women who are infertile? god just put the here for no reason at all? yeah, doesn’t make sense.
7. having a baby doesn’t bring joy to many people, even ones who planned the baby. it’s overwhelming and for many people, children just bring misery.

List of resources that show that criminalising abortion is ineffective and often counterproductive,"List of resources that show criminalising abortion is ineffective and often counterproductive. 

Not only is the abortion rate slightly higher in restrictive countries ([37 versus 34 abortions each year for ever 1,000 women aged 15 to 44](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/abortion-worldwide-2017.pdf)), but the rate of maternal deaths is also higher, including mortality from unsafe abortion procedures which jump from 1% in non-restrictive countries to 37% in restrictive countries, as stated by the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/article_unsafe_abortion.pdf) review of abortion laws.

&gt;  *""Across the world, restrictions on abortion have proven to be ineffective in reducing its occurrence. Research demonstrates that criminalizing abortion, for example, does not reduce the number of abortions that occur each year. In fact, empirical data indicates that the criminalisation of abortion does little or nothing to reduce the number of procedures performed and has little or no effect on preventing abortions.”*

The above is an official statement announced by the [International Women's Health Coalition](https://iwhc.org/resources/amicus-brief-columbias-constitutional-court-restrictions-abortion-ineffective-harmful/)

There is an abundance of scientific meta-analysis by many reputable resources that highlight that abortion restrictions do not decrease the abortion rate, and in many restrictive countries, abortion rates have increased overtime. Please see studies listed below.

Data presented within Latin America and the Caribbean show that over 97% of women of reproductive age live in countries where abortion is restricted or completely banned. Despite restrictive laws, both the absolute number of abortions and rates of abortion in the region have increased in recent decades. Estimates indicate that 6.5 million abortions were performed annually in the period between 2010 and 2014, a considerable increase in relation to the 4.4 million a year that were observed a decade before. During the same period in this region, the percentages of pregnancies that terminated in abortion increased from 1 in 4 in 1990 to 1994 to 1 in 3 pregnancies in 2010 to 2014. In South America alone, it is estimated that there are 4.6 million abortions performed every year, with 34% all pregnancies ending in abortion. 

[source one](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673616303804) and [source two](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide)

Abortion rates registered in South America, a region where abortion procedures are widely restricted, are much higher than those observes in Western Europe and North America, where abortion is generally legal on demand or on broad grounds. In South America, 48 per 1000 women of reproductive age have abortions annually, compared to 16 per 1000 women in Western Europe and 17 per 1000 in North America. Therefore, despite the legal restrictions in South America and the liberalisation of the procedure to a great extent in North America and Western Europe, there are three times more abortions in South America. 

[source](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide) 

Another study on developed countries, where abortion is mostly extensively permitted, the incidence of procedures performed has significantly decreased by 41% since 1990 and is lower than the rate of abortion procedures found in developing countries, where abortion is highly restrictive.

[source](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide)

Studies show that in countries such as Romania and Portugal, where abortion procedures have been decriminalised, reductions in the number of abortions were observed over time. In Romania, for example, a restrictive abortion law was overturned in 1989, and the abortion rate dropped by 94% in the ten years afterward. In addition, the average number of abortions per woman in Romania dropped from 3.4 in 1993 to 0.8 in 2004. The same trend was observed in Portugal, where, in 2016 15,416 abortions were registered, 14.4% less than the 18,014 registered in 2008.

[source one](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/romania-reproductive-health-survey-2004) and [source two](https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/PRT/CEDAW_C_PRT_CO_8-9_Add-1_20592_E.pdf)

According to the World Health Organisation, even though there exist simple, safe and effective procedures to end a pregnancy,] close to 25 million unsafe abortions occur every year, significantly contributing to maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Annually, nearly 7 million women, primarily in restrictive countries, are treated for complications resulting from unsafe abortion procedures, and up to 47,000 women die each year as a result. Unsafe abortions are the third leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide and lead to an additional five million largely preventable disabilities, according to the WHO.

[source one](https://youthsextion.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/2011facts-iaw.pdf) and [source two](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44529/9789241501118_eng.pdf?sequence=1).

The number of abortions per year within the US has been consistently decreasing since 1990. In 1990, there were nearly 1.5 million abortions. As of 2018, which is the latest year of CDC records, the number of abortions is at a rate of 619,591. That is a decrease of over 56%.

An interesting thought from my pro-choice boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I are both pro-choice. We were talking about politics yesterday and the topic of abortion came up. He said something along the lines of, ""being forced to have something grow inside your body? F that.""

&amp;nbsp;

I knew he was pro-choice, but I was really surprised by this response as I've never heard a man make that argument before. Most guys I know are either pro-life, or they're pro-choice for some generalized reason (ie. they don't like it but everyone should decide for themselves). What my bf said is pretty much the exact reason that I'm pro-choice and I felt so understood. I don't like the idea of pregnancy or childbirth or motherhood at all, I hate that I'm just expected to be okay with those things, and I would never want anyone to be forced into it. That sounds like a nightmare.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I just wanted to share a thought that caught me off guard. I'm really glad that he gets it on such a deep level.",t2_e77b4n5s,1631955516,prochoice

How would pro-lifers react to genetically engineered babies?,"With the way technology and science is progressing, genetically engineered designer babies will absolutely be a thing in the not too distant future. So how would pro-lifers react to people having babies that are not 100% natural? We know most of their pro-life stance is based in religion so I imagine they would have serious objections to ""messing with gods design"" like that, but would it be enough for them to suddenly be ok with abortion if its to prevent designer children being born? 

I dunno, this just seems like an amusing future scenario where different religious beliefs clash and I'd be curious to see what you all think as to how they'll rationalise it all together.",t2_140f9fkr,1631951598,prochoice
The “my body my choice” argument makes no sense,Ok I will begin by saying I’m pro life I don’t hate pro choice people but I wanna know why do people keep using the “my body my choice” argument. It implies that an individual gets to choose what happens to their body and that’s a good thing if it’s not your body it’s not your choice. But using that phrase for abortion is kinda dumb since your implying that everyone gets to decide what happens to their body that implies that the fetus gets to choose what happens to their body and last time I checked they didn’t choose to be killed. I’m just saying this argument does nothing but backfire on pro-choicers since it’s the fetuses body so if you use the my body my choice argument than since it’s the fetuses body they get to decide what happens to them and they probably don’t want to be killed.,t2_831bn0b7,1631948181,prochoice

"I've made my decision, and officially am prochoice.","  
Hello, r/prochoice.  
  Although a hard decision, I decided to join this side of the debate. I thought that choosing a side would make me passionate about the topic, but I instead feel sad. I started writing this post thinking that I was gonna explain my reasoning for joining, but I instead feel like sharing my sadness about topics like these. This debate makes me sad, and I think it's because it's not like other debates. Not in that this topic is serious--I take too many things seriously--but in that it is treated differently. 

  Debating about topics I enjoy would normally make me really passionate about it. As a programmer, I enjoy reading passionately written arguments on programming, and being challenged on my own opinion makes me happy. It feels awesome to debate and converse with other programmers despite having different opinions, but I don't get the same feeling with the abortion debate. It's not that it's political, I even enjoy debating politics. It's the misunderstood emotion of anger. 

  A topic so near to everyone's hearts often incites a powerful emotion, and even programming debates can get extremely heated. I feel that debates like this are surrounded in anger, and it's okay to feel angry, [it's a natural emotion](https://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control#:~:text=what%20is%20anger%3F), but you need to release it healthily. We are in a debate that values the rights of individuals, but in doing so we often devalue the opposition. Both sides expect a civil and respectful debate, but both sides talk shit. This causes anger, and it all starts with expectations, which is exactly what [**James Collard**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Collard-3) from the [**Cairnmillar Institute**](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Cairnmillar-Institute) wrote in his [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349339297_Anger_the_misunderstood_emotion), ""Anger, the misunderstood emotion"":

&gt;When looking at the cognitions involved in triggering an anger response, it is often seen that the perception of threat is triggered by the violation of expectations held by the individual (diGuiseppe &amp; Froh, 2002; Novaco, 1978). For example, common expectations include ideas about how others should behave, about how one should be treated, and about not being endangered. The violation of these expectations then results in a judgemental evaluation, whereby the worth of the perceived source of threat is devalued. (Collard, 2021, p.2)

 This problem of how violations of expectations cause people to devalue another occurs in other political debates, and it makes me sad. For example, the Canadian party [Bloc Québécois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois), often gets called racist, and many \*[Quebecers think that it's an insult](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/federal-election-2021/quebec-bashing-why-an-english-federal-debate-question-continues-to-draw-criticism-1.5588176). Whether or not they are, this claim ultimately doesn't help debates because calling them such incites anger. As Collard said, ""common expectations include ideas about how others should behave, about how one should be treated...""(Collard, 2021, p.2) The supporters of the party, and leaders thereof get angry because to them it violates how they should be treated. This in turn causes people to devalue the other person, and in turn, ignore the arguments in the opposition. They think people are ""Quebec bashing"", but they're not bashing Quebec, but rather they're upset about certain things their provincial government have put in place. This is the problem when you attack the person, not the ideology. It's something I see on both sides. 

  This ""person-bashing"" doesn't solve anything, and it exists on both sides of the debate. Both sides have it existing in memes, rants, and even articles. Labeling a person--true or not--is not a debate friendly thing, and yet both sides do it. It's an unhealthy way of dealing with anger. If you think someone's opinion is sexist, don't say, ""You're a sexist."" True or not, ultimately you are just upsetting them. You may not think it's an insult, but to them it is, and therefore you're just ""violating their expectations"" and making them angry. Whether or not they follow it, r/prolife has an amazing rule, called ""Attack the ideology, and not the person who holds it."", and I think regardless of your position it is the perfect rule for all debates.   


TL;DR: I joined prochoice, but I am saddened by the anger in the abortion debate. Basically my core message here is to respect others and don't devalue the opposition, devalue their arguments.    


P.S. I struggle at writing, so I spent hours on this post. I would love to hear your thoughts.

Pregnancy has made me more pro-choice than ever.,"Hope that this is the right place to vent about this.

I don't mean this in a bad way - I love my baby girl and I am convinced I made the right decision. However, seven months of being pregnant have opened my eyes to the reality of how difficult it is to just be carrying a child. 

I cannot imagine losing clients, throwing up all over the place, losing and then gaining weight, losing sleep, and then peeing incessantly and so much more if I did not have the stability to care for it. And to think that this is all a part of a normal pregnancy - I know that it can be so much worse for women who have complicated pregnancies. It's made me acknowledge that I was privileged to be able to say yes to unplanned motherhood.

I'm just so mad because pro-lifers who were aware of me and my partner's initial doubt have come forward to congratulate us for our choice to keep the pregnancy, saying that they knew we would support pro-life eventually...uh, no that is not how it works. I made a rational decision to sustain a pregnancy after considering a variety of options. I did not ever, for a second, think that I needed to keep an unplanned pregnancy by default. 

One female friend who urged my partner and I to ""just give her the child"" after I gave birth nearly had me fly off the handle. It felt like she discounted the entire process of being pregnant and that she did not even think of the state of the orphanages in our country. 

I am fine with people being pro-life but I wish they would not use my pregnancy in their campaigning...it is absolutely ridiculous.",t2_il5mkoh,1631901655,prochoice

any other trans men in here? how do you feel about this?,"just curious to hear from other transmasc people (or those who aren't, if you want to throw your two cents in!) who are passionate about this. for me, going on testosterone means that i had to stop taking birth control, because of the hormonal imbalance they'd create together. i've considered getting an iud or so on, but haven't, as of yet. 

i haven't had a hysterectomy yet - i'm hoping technology for bottom surgery improves in the future, and i'm waiting for developments in that area. additionally, i'd like to donate my uterus to a trans woman, if science develops to that point. it might be an unrealistic or silly goal to keep the damn thing around for, but. 

sometimes, pro-choice statements or environments can feel a bit alienating, especially when there's a push against gender-inclusive language. (and i feel bad for my trans sisters, who tend to be blamed for it for some reason). 

but i think it's important to point out how important that language can be, especially in legislation. i'm working to get my gender marker changed to male. when i do, in a lot of places, insurance won't cover obgyn services or pap smears or so on, because they cover those services for *women.* switching language is just important so that trans men don't get left behind. check out the movie 'southern comfort', for example. 

the idea of getting pregnant is like . . . wildly distressing to me. i know that's not an experience exclusive to trans men, but even thinking about it, and the dysphoria it causes, makes me want to turn my skin inside out. maybe it's callous of me to say, but i don't care whether the fetus would be considered a baby or not - the state of being pregnant or giving birth is so mentally upsetting, i honestly think i wouldn't survive the process. 

maybe it's self-centered to link the issue back to myself and other men at risk, but i think being trans has made me super passionate about this for a few reasons. one is more obvious, but also - i fully believe people know what's best for their body, and should have control over it when it comes to things like gender affirmation or abortion. it's not mutilation or murder. sometimes it's life or death. 

sorry to ramble - i just wanted to talk about my own experiences, and maybe open up the floor to any other trans people in this sub. maybe i'm just not looking hard enough, but i haven't seen a ton of discussions ft. us.",t2_6aattcbj,1631855242,prochoice

How is forcing women to keep a pregnancy they don't want any different than forcing abortions on people for having too many kids like in china????,This is something I can't stop thinking about. Imagine you accidentally get pregnant and you want the child and you're excited but the government steps in and tells you you have to abort your child because you already have two kids. I know comparing the two situations is a stretch but hear me out if we give the government the power to control our reproductive freedom when it comes to forced pregnancy what is stopping them from forced abortions in the future when over population becomes a very real issue? The PL aren't considering the door they're opening by allowing these legislations and personally I think they're just shooting themselves in the foot. We need abortion. We need people who take a step back and decide hey I'm not parent material I can't do this.  We already have 8 billion people on this planet.

"The goal of the pro life religious right movement is nothing more than to force women into reproductive submission. It’s not about babies, and discussion of viability etc. is a distraction and a red herring.","
First part is quoted from a podcast I stumbled upon, the part after the quote is my own reflection and reaction to that podcast.

“The point of all of this, The point of the anti-choice legislature has nothing to do with fucking babies. I’m fucking done entertaining that conversation….

The points of antichoice legislation is and I believe always has been about controlling women. This has nothing to do with babies. And at this point, I refuse to entertain conversations about viability, and when it’s a good time or not, because all of that is a red herring bullshit distractions. They want you to have conversations like that instead of pointing out the truth. 

The truth is that this is and has always been about keeping women subservient to men. The lack of access to abortion is always indisputably and invariably always higher in states that DO NOT have comprehensive sex education, access to inexpensive and ubiquitous contraception. If there was really a genuine concern about quantity of life and quality of life for babies, the Actions of Those states would reflect that. 

What they really want is for women to get pregnant and to have to keep those babies even if They don’t want to. Well why do you want women to get pregnant? Well if women are pregnant, they’re out of the workforce. If they have two three four five kids at home, they’re likely out of the workforce. It’s less competition in college, less competition In the workforce, it’s less competition for men. This has always been about controlling women, limiting their access to financial freedoms, limiting their access to educational opportunities, to reduce their impact on men. 

I think we do ourselves a terrible disservice when we have conversations about abortion That entertain any other argument. I will entertain the viability argument when We have solved the contraception problem. When contraception is free and ubiquitous in every county and every state, when sex education is Comprehensive and not abstinence based. When sex education is comprehensive and doesn’t have anything to do with religious themes about sullying your body if you have sex and All this nonsense which is meant to drive people into a shame position which makes people less likely to go buy condom and less likely To have frank conversations with their parents doctors and authority figures who would give them access To contraceptive so they don’t get pregnant. 

All of that is the point. The point is to keep women down, the point is to keep women subservient, further enshrine patriarchal hegemony. And everything else is a fucking distraction. 

They engineered this and then they utilized the biggest patriarchal organization in the country the religious right. They utilized the religious right to spread this message for years. The Religious right loves this message, Loves the idea of the patriarchy, they absolutely adore it and they want to keep the status quo. That’s why that same exact institution, that Christian institution was the same for millennia. 

They (meaning Republican political leaders) knew that they could utilize this group of people, they’re very gullible and republicans could easily use them as a force,  So they created this wedge issue,
Engineered this whole thing so it became this overarching policy that directed all of their political agenda for the past several decades. (If you look up the history of the religious right and the desegregation of Bob Jones University, you will also find that it originated with deeply racist segregationist roots)


…. We build this mythology of family values around this fucking nonsense. Family values is just a way for the religious right to say “women stay home and men go to work.” That’s what family values is. They make it sound like something else, but There’s nothing else, there’s nothing else to it. Family values is “shut the fuck up and get back in the kitchen.”

And that’s what these anti-choice laws are designed to do. They are designed to keep women giving birth, to keep women pregnant. Therefore Keeping women less educated, and less competitive in the workforce During their prime working years so that men don’t have to compete with them. That’s what family values is. 

If they cared about pregnancies happening that they didn’t want, they would figure out a way for the man to be the one Who has to go somewhere like Go to the doctor to have a kid, right, and the reason why the birth control pill actually happened is because The women didn’t want to have the kid, because they’re the ones who are going to be saddled with the kid. 

At the very least, if you really cared, You’d be giving condoms out like lollipops. There would be free condoms, free birth control for women across the board. 

But these same fuckers fight that shit. They fight contraceptive access. It goes against their weird sky daddy, but it also fits in line with everything the right wants to have. This is a marriage literally made in heaven.”




https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cognitive-dissonance/id432165463?i=1000534437881




Now, I don’t personally know these two guys, nor do I listen to their show on a regular basis, I just happened to run across this podcast while looking for news podcasts about women’s rights issues. 

However, they are spot on, and just like them, I will absolutely refuse to entertain any conversation about viability or “irresponsibility” because it is a distraction, and it is a deliberate distraction from the real issue, which is that the religious right is attempting to force everyone else to follow their religious patriarchal misogynistic beliefs systems and they are attempting to Force women into reproductive submission to men so that we cannot access equal rights and equitable rights.  There is a class issue and a race issue inherent to this as well as a misogyny issue. 

I will leave it up to other pro-choice supporters to decide which conversations they engage in, but I have seen far too many ridiculous distractions from this very basic goal of the religious right. I have seen pro-life people advocate for theocracy, of course only theocracy that puts their own religion in power, and not anyone else’s. 

This is why, in addition to the unconstitutionality of the SB8 Texas law, we are saying the religious right is a threat to our democracy. The religious right is attempting to use a circumvention of the constitution in order to enforce their own patriarchal misogynistic religious beliefs on everyone else including all of us who do not share those same religious patriarchal misogynistic beliefs. 

*When pro life people do not want to address the misogyny of their movement, or try to pretend we are the misogynistic ones, it is because they are aware of the purpose of their movement and they are trying to hide it from us.* 

I have not been fooled, and I will not suffer any fools who attempts to distract from the foundation of this issue. It’s not about the babies and it never fucking was because those politicians never gave a shit about a mother homeless on the street with her child, those political figures never gave a fuck about improving sexual education in schools or improving access to contraceptives. In Texas, they can’t even be arsed to deal with their covid problems. They do not care about babies, because if they cared about babies they would be working towards ensuring that every child is wanted, healthy, safe, and the woman who is gestating that child is supported, consenting, healthy, and safe.

I know this is going to rub a lot of pro life people the wrong way, and that’s great, bring it. I’m sure there are many people on the pro life side who genuinely believe that they care about babies, but your actions and your politicians show the exact opposite. So that is something that you have to explain and you have to deal with because you are the ones who are claiming one thing and claiming one set of beliefs while operating in a way that oppresses and causes suffering for women and children. 

I have talked to enough pro life people by now to know that the vast majority when pushed enough to reveal their opinions, genuinely believe that women are not as free or deserving of rights as men are and that we should be under the thumb of whichever man impregnates us. There are enough pro-life people who genuinely believe that a woman’s purpose is always to produce children for man, and that if she has any ideas of her own about that not being her purpose, she is simply wrong and must be punished. I even spoke with a pro life person the other day who believes that if all women decided that they didn’t want to have anymore children, if we all decided it as a group, that it would justify enslaving, raping, and forcing us through pregnancy while enslaved. I spoke to another pro-life person who claims that men are not responsible for ejaculating into a vagina, but women are responsible when men ejaculate into a vagina. They also accused rape victims of living a “risky lifestyle” and claimed that if they were a woman, they could easily avoided all predatory man with no problem. The misogyny of that kind of thinking is inherent to the religious right. Regardless of what any single individual pro life person thanks, the movement is founded and based on this misogynistic-patriarchal-religious belief system. 

I will no longer argue about viability, limits on late term abortion’s, or any other bullshit that is meant to distract from the fundamental issue which is that *the religious right wants women to be second class citizens and have our rights to our own body autonomy, body integrity, privacy, access to medical care, religious beliefs, and self-defense revoked simply because a man managed to get his sperm up inside us by whatever means and that sperm fertilized an egg that then implanted into our uterus is against our will.*

The sperm of a man does not and will not have the power to remove my basic human rights. I cannot wait to see what excuses you guys come up with in the comments. I will ignore anyone who tries to distract from the issue and I’ll block anyone who’s being a dick to me or anyone else. 

I want a real fucking explanation for why any person should accept your misogynistic religious doctrine being enshrined into law. 

Have fun you guys!


#It seems that we have a few people who don’t understand fully what is being said here. Not only does the religious right as a movement believe that women should be oppressed on the basis of sex, but it is fundamentally impossible to hold the belief that women are required by law or by morals to gestate any implantation that occurs inside her body, and simultaneously claim you are not misogynistic. 

If a single sperm has the ability to remove many of my basic human rights over my own body and health, then you don’t believe that I am deserving of equal rights to men. You cannot be pro life and not be a misogynist. It is fundamentally impossible. I’m sorry that that’s difficult to hear, but it’s just the reality. Forcing women to be incubators for pregnancies that they didn’t want and in most cases actively try to prevent, is fundamentally misogynistic. There is no avoiding this reality. 

If it makes you upset to be told that, that is an indication that you need to think more deeply about your beliefs. Please think deeply about it, and get to the root of why you think it is such a problem for women to be able to decide when and if we are ready and capable of doing the most important task in the world of carrying a healthy pregnancy to term and giving birth. Why would women have the biological capability, only to be told that we’re not responsible enough to decide when to do it. If you believe that women aren’t responsible enough to decide when do the thing we are biologically built to be capable of, then you don’t believe in the equality/equity of women. 

What is so scary to you about women being able to decide when we are capable of caring a pregnancy to term? Are you having an existential crisis about that power being out of your hands? Are you concerned that your mother would have aborted you if she had the choice? Are you concerned that men don’t have the right to determine which of their sperm results in a baby? Does it bother you that some women are  forgoing their “duty” to be mothers? 

Do some introspection. Think about where you learned these ideas about women and men and why you might’ve been taught them. Question your preconceived notions, and do some research.",t2_5kwcwner,1631806518,prochoice

"If anti-choicers believe what they say they believe, then they should be in favor of forced organ donation.","Why is the uterus the only organ the government can force you to donate? Think how many lives could be saved if you could mandate healthy people to donate one kidney, or one lung. You can live just fine with one of each, so there's really no reason not to, if you value human life over bodily autonomy. Or at least there should be some legal requirement to donate blood. Hell, giving blood just inconveniences you for an afternoon; it's trivial compared to nine months of pregnancy and hours or days spent in childbirth.

In fact, I looked it up. About 4.5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year. Compare that to the about 600,000 abortions performed in America in 2018. In terms of lives saved, forced blood donation is *clearly* superior to forced births. (And about 120,000 Americans are currently in need of life-saving organ donations, for the record.)

And yet, somehow, anti-choicers never make these arguments. They respect bodily autonomy in all instances but one. Shit, we even let *corpses* keep their organs. You ever think how fucking ridiculous that is? If some greedy bastard wants to hang onto their organs after they're done using them, you legally cannot stop them. Doesn't matter if it would save lives. If you have a uterus and you live in Texas, you actually *gain* bodily autonomy by dying.

Even granting that fetuses are people, this clearly isn't about saving lives. It's almost as if there's something else going on here. 🤔 Can't imagine what.",t2_d2mucgfm,1631764371,prochoice

Should pro-choice arguments be less focused on women and more focused on how fetuses are not lives?,"As a supporter of rights to choose, I had hoped pro-choice rhetoric would have evolved by now into newer ones, but they have stayed stagnant. After the Texas debacle happened, all I saw was nothing but utterly unoriginal takes on how ""if men could get pregnant abortions would be legal right away"" and how ""men should not be allowed to vote on women's bodies"", cringy ""sex boycotts"", and so on.

I find the focus on men to be problematic because men do not oppose abortion rights that much more than women. Depending on the pollster and conditions, men may support it [less](http://news.gallup.com/poll/245618/abortion-trends-gender.aspx) or [more](http://mobile.twitter.com/davidshor/status/1311890493337464835), but never are the differences between men and women massive. In fact, pro-life people try to shame men who support abortions with messages like how men only support it to get out of responsibility, as might be seen in comments [here](http://m.facebook.com/studentsforlife/photos/a.384330482926/10157578489902927/?type=3&amp;source=57&amp;refid=52&amp;__tn__=EH-R).

In light of this, I wonder if it may be more effective to attack pro-life messages directly, by showing that fetus is not a life. We can use science to back up this opinion.

Sometimes I wonder if pro lifers actually understand what it is to be pro choice,"Essentially what the title says. Every pro life person I’ve seen (well not every, but most) seem to think that the second a pro choice person gets pregnant they want to abort. But I’m reality that’s just not true???? It’s pro CHOICE. As in, choosing between having the child and not. Believing in body autonomy and respecting individual decisions. Pro choice is not “must have abortion. There is no other option” when that goes against everything pro choice even stands for. Pro choice is all about options! 

This is all prompted by a post I just saw in which a pro lifer claimed that they would ‘out breed’ pro choice people. But how. How are they going to do that when pro choice people also choose to have children? And sure. Outbreeding is. Great. What if your child grows up to be pro choice? Then what?

"""My Best Friend Had an ABORTION!!"" stories","I don't mean the true stories of people who have had abortions and not regretted them. 

I mean the exaggerated, crocodile-tears-soaked sob stories that EVERY ""pro-life"" activist seems to have up their sleeves, ready to tell at a moment's notice. 

In every story, somebody close to them had an abortion. They were not present when this person took the pregnancy test, or went to a doctor, or made an appointment at a clinic, but they tell the story as if they were right there the entire time. They describe how ""heartbroken"" their relative or friend was afterwards, how they ""still cry"" when they think of the fetal tissue they had removed from their uterus, and oh how sad it is that they've ""always regretted"" the abortion. They get so worked up, you'd think this had happened to them. Except, of course, it didn't.

I call bullshit on Every. Single. Story. 

For one thing, too many of these stories start with ""My best friend..."" who isn't even given a pseudonym. She only exists in the context of being the one person the speaker knows who Had An Abortion. She's a one-dimensional character who is defined by this one decision and the speaker uses weepy language to condemn her for it and predict that her life will be full of nothing but misery and regret. 

For another, why isn't this ""best friend"" telling the story themselves if they ""regret"" it so much? Has the speaker gotten permission from them to tell the story by proxy? And if not, WHY would they do this to someone they claim to care so much about? What do they get from telling the world about someone else's abortion without that person's permission?

Even if they did have a relative who had an abortion, that is not their business. They can judge them privately, but using their abortion story to make roomfuls of strangers judge them, too? Reprehensible. It's not their story to tell, or share, especially if it's true.",t2_e4yl04ow,1631632499,prochoice

Do any of you think prolifers think every fetus being aborted is past its viability date?,"What I can gather from prolifers is that they believe that a large sum of pregnancies ended are ended when the woman is 40 weeks pregnant and is about to give birth (I’m over exaggerating here). But seriously, prolifers think all women who seek abortion are past the viability date. Prolifers see that a tiny human is created right when conception happens. What I mean by that is that prolifers see the embryo not as a clump of cells that doesn’t even look like a human, but like a miniature human that grows bigger, but in reality, it forms different from that. They claim they know biology, which I know they do, but they are putting an embryo in higher standing than the woman. Prolifers only see the fetus as innocent.

Abortion is lifesaving healthcare for me.,"I have severe tokophobia and even though I go to therapy and try to work with it. No amount of therapy would ever cure my fear of pregnancy or vaginal birth. They don’t realize that pregnancy is not an inconvenience. They think that pregnancy and popping out kids is something easy and that people jump with joy and are ready to be considered “mommy warriors” because they choose to almost die for pushing a football sized being out of them. They think women want to experience the trauma and pain and that we will get over it because we woman all have “secretive mommy fever!” and “we just don’t know it yet! We don’t know any better! Once we are violated and impregnated we woman will get our mother instinct! And not want to be abort UWU!” 

Yet, they can’t understand once you educate yourself and see the reality of what pregnancy can do to a woman a lot of of us would rather die then give birth. 

Just like a man in war who ends his life before the enemy captures him and who knows what messed up torture they’ll do to them. Is how I would seriously end my life if I knew I couldn’t get an abortion because I know there is a torture that I would never ever desire to experience.

Did Catholic Hospitals in the USA choose to let women die rather than perform a life saving abortion pre Roe v Wade?,"My mom mentioned this tonight while talking about Catholic hospitals.

She's both passionate about the subject but as a matter of reading not super informed about Catholicism. I've actually never been to a christian worship ceremony and only stepped foot in a church on a handful of occasions but some of the stuff she thinks about Catholicism doesn't check out. 

I went looking for accounts of this specifically but cannot find this answered specifically. I see some catholic hospitals saying uterine evacuation to save a mother is permissible under certain circumstances, or its up to the committee of that particular hospital. A UCSF article suggests ""Although Catholic doctrine officially deems abortion permissible to preserve the life of the woman, Catholic-owned hospital ethics committees differ in their interpretation of how much health risk constitutes a threat to a woman’s life and therefore how much risk must be present before they approve the intervention.""

Examples of women dying in catholic hospitals for failure to receive care along those lines? Certainly this would have made the NYT or something at the time?

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1631520019,prochoice

What are your opinions on LT abortions?,"Hey guys!

What are your thoughts on LT (Late term) abortions? I'm thinking of getting one (for religious reasons) and I want to know some of you guy's thoughts on them

I've had 3 abortions already, and this is what I'm going to do, I'm thinking about incubating this one for a while so not only can me and my fiance have lots of hot pregnancy sex (something we had wanted to do for awhile, plus I heard sex is better when you're preg) and then getting a LT abortion later (for my religion of course) because I don't want kids and I'd rather spend my money on literally anything other than an ankle biter  

I've gotten these comments before and I just want to say before anyone gets up In arms:

1.I'm an anarchist. I do things purely for pleasure I don't care about your anti-abortion ""it's a human"" arguments 

2. I don't generally view the fetus as human till it starts breathing, and I don't view mine as human till it's wanted (which should be standard for fetuses) 

3. No I'm not telling you what my religion is, I get discriminated against so much because of it.

4. No I'm going to regret it. I recorded my second abortion, and I had a screenshot of said recording up on my wall it freeks religious people out lol, I live in a very religious area and I get shocked faces from the Mormons I invite in. when they ask me if I have any kids I show them those pictures on the living room wall their reactions are delightfully funny

A powerful quote by progressive Methodist pastor David Barnhart,"Here’s a quote from a Methodist pastor named David Barnhart on the double standards of pro-lifers 

“”The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.“ David Barnhart",t2_75401o9k,1631489561,prochoice
A dilemma I have about souls,"I’m an aspiring who primarily works within the horror genre. A lot of the stories I write involve souls mainly because I find the concept to be interesting. Unfortunately due to the fact that I can’t look away from the situation In Texas I realized that pro life people use the concept to justify their beliefs. I’m now worried that by creating a universe where every living thing has a soul I could be unknowingly perpetuating pro life messages. 

Then I realized something... I could potentially use this as an opportunity for a counter argument. Yes in this universe all living things have souls including fetuses, but that also means that tape worms have souls as well as all other parasites that harm humans. Souls could be framed more like batteries in a remote. They give an organism energy to operate, though that doesn’t necessarily give something inherent value. A fetus might have a soul but it isn’t human until it’s born. A fetus might not have a soul and simply be the developing cells that form the body for the soul. Maybe the soul doesn’t actually form until birth. I don’t know. I’m looking at this more as a fictional concept, because I don’t personally believe souls exist in real life.

Feel free to critique my take since I am not a person with a uterus and I’ll be the first to admit that this interpretation of souls might not be perfect. I want to be a good ally to everyone who has to deal with abortion laws so all suggestions would be appreciated.",t2_5qrnjy53,1631488030,prochoice
sb8: will we see any of these possibilities?,"I'm a bit ignorant on this issue, but I was reading and thinking about what might happen next in Texas, and what may happen in other states if RvW falls. I would be curious on your perspective.  

Do you think any of the following will happen in Texas: 

1. People just keep secrets.  It should be relatively easy to keep a &gt;6 week abortion secret as one will have plausible deniability up until you see the doctor. Problem:  the doctor who would have to risk their livelihood to perform the procedure.
2. An activist doctor decides to just continue the status quo.  These are civil suits, the doctors keeps getting sued thousands of times, never goes to court, keeps getting default judgements, gets wages garnished and liens on homes, but legally must be provided enough income to live and performs thousands of medical abortions a year.  Problem - very few doctors would go for this. But is this even possible?
3. Same as #2 above, but donations are given to the doctor to keep them financially stable and cover legal fees
4. Telemedicine for medical abortions from out of state.
5. Tens of thousands of women go online to websites to find out, without a doctor's guidance, to order and take mifepristrone and misoprostrol from pharmacies online in Mexico, India, or other countries (many studies have shown you often can get legit formulations, and I can vouch for getting drugs in the mail from other countries without a prescription)

Is it really about life??? (Tw/suicide/abuse),"

•I escaped my abusive family at 18


•my BC, the only one available to me, failed at 19

•my periods where never regular, and I never learned how to track what nobody taught me to

•im forced to go back to my abusers once again for support, but was held against my will for a week.
(""Just leave"" wasn't feasible)

•I was already racing against the clock, this was my last chance but instead I get a call the morning of my first scheduled consultation that they cannot take me because Texas blocked abortion access for covid

•i attempt to take my life out of crushing defeat

•my HG basically kept me from even drinking water let alone eat, no one told me morning sickness wasn't just in the morning
I lose 40lbs over 3 months but the HG itself didn't go away until 7 months

•my bf's family was nice enough to take me in during this time

•i get taken to the emergency room 3 times, and was charged no less than 600 each time just for zofran and fluids
(And prescribed b6 on my last visit)

•medicaid did it's best to refuse to pay for bills from my first month of pregnancy because I managed to get them to accept me on month 4-5. I'm still paying for it because I couldn't get my FIRST job untill 6 months post partum.
((Which I subsequently couldn't stick with since I developed panic attacks that caused physical pain, throwing up, and passing out))

•i attempt suicide for the second time
Just to stop the suffering, obviously I failed and was once again held against my will

•Im constantly reminded that whatever I go through doesn't matter, because there's a life growing inside me.
That even though my body is trying to throw up what it doesn't have, ""you'll feel a little bit of sickness and discomfort but that's ok you'll be fine""

•I don't get to say ""this ain't it chief""
Because I'm being dramatic for not having the energy for much else than breathing or passing out trying to take a shower.
But because people who think pregnancy ""isn't that bad"" say so and that I'm a POS for taking back SOME control by choosing death instead.

•obviously I only wanted to use abortion as birth control for having the audacity to spread my legs after doing all I could to have sex responsibly with the knowledge and opportunity I had. My only goal was to kill a child of course, not to solve what truly was and felt like a life or death issue in a place where I felt grateful a doctor saw me struggling and pretended to have a smidge of sympathy

3. violating the women constitutional right could be an offense since it come to my understanding that courts in the pass have rule on the mother side

A choice based game about abortion,"I needed something a bit more lighthearted, so I thought how a video game would look like that's based on abortion and here are some of my ideas:

Since every abortion has its own story, I thought about having multiple stories to choose from. For example, one story is about a teenage girl who got pregnant and another seperat story is about a mother who already has child, doesn't want anymore kids but gets pregnant again.

Anyways, you choose one of the characters and then the story begins. 

I've also thought about adding a ""randomizer"" thingy. For example, when you chose to carry on the pregnancy but gave it up for adoption.

This randomizer will be based on real life statistic. For example, if you ever see your child again after they grew up, if your child ever got adopted, if your child got abused in the Foster care system or not etc.

So possible endings (for the kid) could be:
a) You never know what happened to your kid.
b) You're child got adopted and has a happy life
c) You're child is miserable and wished they were just aborted
e) Something in-between of b and c

And then there would be an ending for you own life and how all this affected you. 

The point of the game should be to show people, that everyone has the right to choose (that's why it's a choice based game ;P) Whether or not you choose to carry on the pregnancy or to terminate it, it will have a consequence.

On another note, someone might have already made a game like this XD",t2_35tfgfls,1631397764,prochoice

Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinions, but one’s personal opinion on the topic is not a justifiable reason to deny another person of necessary medical care. It’s just as silly as pitting science against creationism, or debating someone about a conspiracy theory that can be easily disproved.

I don't want kids. I'm not fit to be a parent. I participate in safe sex. I want the right to choose in the case of that .01% event happening.,"Let me be clear. I'm most likely a borderline case of ASPD or a similar mental illness. (Have not been officially diagnosed as of yet) I can be incredibly apathetic, careless and most of the time have a rather high disregard for my own safety as well as others.

I'm not fit to be a parent. I know this, I've known it for a long time. I don't want kids. Don't care about them. I know that if I were to have a baby, I'd end up killing it. The sleep depravation and frustration that come along with a newborn are difficult for any parent, but I know that in my own case it'd be a deal-breaker. I'd either just kill it on purpose or neglect it until it died on its own. Maybe I'd last a few months, maybe a few years. You know what, for the purpose of an entertaining visual, let's say I made it through it's childhood and it became a teenager. This kid would not be okay. I can't give a kid the attention and love and care they need. I'd've just raised another menace to society, and even though I don't care much about others, I care enough to not want someone else to have my problems.

So my having kids would just cause a tremendous financial burden to society. It wouldn't help anyone in any way. It'd just make a lot of things a lot worse.

""Just put it up for adoption"" so you think I'm going to put my body through absolute fucking hell for 9 months for me to get absolutely nothing? Fuck that, I'm not doing that for anyone. 

Now, I like sex. I like everything about it. And I have it. Now, I use condoms. I have an IUD. I don't want any fucking accidents. But sometimes the .01% happens and I could get pregnant. And in that case I want myself to have the right to choose. To choose to not bring a living thing into this world. To choose to not create a massive burden to society.

So I just spent a long ass time trying to convince a pro lifer, who was defending the Alabama law that restricts abortion but does nothing about IVF, that letting embryos die during IVF should be at least “as bad as” abortion for a couple reasons- intentional fertilization of the embryos, lack of violation of bodily autonomy as justification, the number of embryos that die per couple, etc.   
        
It very much didn’t work- he ended up saying at one point that letting hundreds of IVF embryos die was completely fine, because they die a “natural death” (which doesn’t sound very prolife to me) while still being anti-abortion, but it got me thinking, do any pro choicers here think that IVF is wrong?   
    
My main justification for being pro-choice is the bodily autonomy reasoning, which doesn’t apply to IVF clearly as the embryos aren’t inside the woman’s body.

"Material on good, sound, logical arguments for Pro-Choice?","Hope this is appropriate to ask here. Thanks peeps!

I would consider myself a pretty clear PC person, but that seems to only be a gut feeling that I cannot intellectually defend too well. Recently I've been looking into the arguments on both sides and unfortunately PL seems to hold that edge on the media for me. I do have a religious background (deconstructing however) so I've heard the 'Christian' arguments, which annoy the crap out of me. 

However, there have been some non-religious PL arguments that seem sound and logical. Stephanie Gray's talk at google was a pretty concise one for me. Intellectually her arguments made sense to me (I'm not heavily informed on this topic just yet), but I still felt highly uncomfortable with the idea of pro-lifers that abortions are inherently bad. The only arguments PC I know of tend to be emotional and dare-say anecdotal. Stuff like rape and abuse, which is completely valid, but can't exactly be used in a super sterile academic discussion??? 

Anyways, if anyone could be so kind to point me towards podcast/videos/articles that give a PC perspective that is logical and sound. Been having a find time finding so. I just wanna be as informed as I can be when defending PC. Thanks!

So is this a good way to explain bodily autonomy for abortion debate ?,"So I never knew exactly what was the bodily autonomy argument and I seen pro lifer use example of  the bodily autonomy to try to debunk it but the sample I give I never thought they would be counted as bodily autonomy. So I went over to r/Abortiondebate and ask them to explain bodily autonomy and basically how I interpreted was

No one have the right to force me into using my body against my will so another person can stay alive

So one example of pro lifer using to disprove bodily autonomy is that if a person was gonna fall to their death and they wanted to use your body to prevent that they should have the right to use your body to so they don't fall.

I would say that is not bodily autonomy, my reason being

1. they don't need specify a human body specifically, just something to hang onto
2. them staying alive is not dependent on my body, since after they fall there body still fully work they can still breath on their own they can still eat and drink and absorbed nutrient, they can sill move their limbs as they are falling, basically there body do not need mine to function. 

A good example of a body that do need another body to function is a 10 week fetus, a 10 week fetus cannot live without a host, they cannot function on their own they still need a host to function, a fetus can't breath or absorbed nutrient on their own they need the mother to do that for them so they can stay alive. A person falling from a great height can still function and even survive the fall in some cases.

Another example that might be use is if you abandoned a baby and leave them alone is that a example of bodily autonomy ?

my personal opinion

No this isn't bodily autonomy cause the baby need help surviving not being alive, a baby can still function on their own, it still have life it don't need another person body to make their body work! it can still eat if you give it food, it can still breath, it can still pump it's own blood it don't need the mother body to do that, Now obtaining the food is a different story but helping another person is not an example of bodily autonomy 

Also yes there is a difference between being alive and and surviving and living 

1. Alive is to have life 
2. Living is to enjoy your life 
3. Surviving is to do the bare minimum to not die basically

I shared this [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTTFDX7j6cc/?utm_medium=copy_link) after the bill was passed since I was feeling emotional. My friend was upset that I shared the post and said those are lives lost and she would no longer attending my housewarming party. It took me by surprise considering she is usually very understanding. I gave it a couple days and did my best to take care of myself since I was having some low mental health days. She texted me very upset that I ignored her feelings and she would like to talk in-person but won’t be able to meet for a few weeks. 

I guess I’m having trouble understanding her reasoning. I’m also disappointed that I was able to respect her beliefs and maintain the friendship even though her beliefs felt hurtful. I took those feelings to therapy and didn’t project that onto her. I think she justifies my abortion since it was medically necessary, but either way my pregnancy had to be terminated. I shared the post to bring awareness that it’s not just a religious belief or debate to be had—people have real, lived experiences and it’s not black and white. I am forever impacted and even reading about people who think all abortions are evil makes me want to cry. I’m looking for some support or if anyone has been in a similar situation. 

(Background: over a year ago, I got pregnant while on the hormonal IUD. It was traumatic and the pregnancy had to be treated as ectopic. I was given methotrexate since my body was not able to naturally miscarry. After the positive pregnancy test, my friend asked me to “please don’t do anything yet,” and she would raise my baby if need be. She texted me around the 5 week mark stating that I could usually hear a heartbeat by now which is pretty cool. I told her those comments were hurtful since I didn’t have any idea what was going on and it didn’t seem like it was even a viable pregnancy. I communicated that I understood if she couldn’t be supportive in the way I needed due to her religious views, but held the boundary that those comments weren’t okay. She apologized and said she would support me no matter what. I did my own work in therapy and was able to move on with the friendship)",t2_rxx25,1631200278,prochoice

The abortion debate shouldn’t be treated as a sexist issue.,"Before I get downvoted to oblivion, please hear me out

Disclaimer: I am 100% pro choice and agree that the choice to have an abortion should be up to the woman and her doctor.

Often times, when I read or hear about the abortion debate, this idea keeps popping up of how “men in power are trying to dictate what women can or can’t do with their bodies” as a main centerpiece to this discussion. And while I agree that men should not be able to have this type of authority over women, we can’t ignore the unfortunate reality, which is that there are a large number of women that are against and are actively fighting against abortion. And those women do contribute to getting prolifers elected into offices.

This needs to be treated as a human rights issue across both sexes. Otherwise, we will continue to see more Amy Coney Barrett’s (and of course other prolife justices) being placed into positions of power.

Texas Peaceful Protest Idea - Phone In,"Hey everybody,

I'm just as pissed as the next progressive that Texas has decided to take away women's choice. But rather than simply be mad, I suggest we take peaceful action to show our disapproval.

At it's most basic level a government is just an entity that provides services to its community. It's like a business. It has people like you or me working behind desks to try to help get whatever needs doing done. Because a government is staffed by people, they need to communicate with one another and the community, through phones, fax and email.

What I propose is we overwhelm this system such that no work gets done. Flood the phone lines so government business grinds to a halt. Send pages and pages of random text (or even better, the Roe V. Wade decision text) to their fax lines or emails. 

As a bonus, governments make many taxes and filings due at the end of the quarter, like this month! So I suggest we pick a day or two at the end of this month to do this to have maximum impact. We can coordinate with other friendly reddit communities to encourage other people to join in.

I've already found a list of phone and fax numbers for the Texas state government ([https://dirpub.dir.texas.gov/](https://dirpub.dir.texas.gov/)), but I don't really have any emails. Maybe some of you internet sleuths can find a directory of emails.

Anyway, this was just my first idea. Obviously I wanted to keep it peaceful while also allowing people from all over the country join in. Let me know what you guys think or if you have any other ideas!",t2_66m8c,1631127809,prochoice

Is there a limit to how many parties can sue per abortion in Texas? As far as I can tell millions of people across the country could file a suit for every single incident, which seems untenable.

Likewise, is there a limit to how many parties can BE sued for “abetting” a single abortion?  Like, could someone sue the clinic, the doctor, the nurse, the receptionist, the therapist, the friend who helped pay for it, the taxi driver, etc?

And what’s to keep Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, et. al.. from filing all these lawsuits and donating the money back just to tie up the courts?

Currently, I just think that abortion is not moral in certain situations (for example aborting a baby just because you don't have the financial resources or just don't want a baby). The morality of abortion can be justified in cases such as rape and if the mother's life is in danger according to me. I also currently believe that abortion is taking away the baby's life. I also think that abortion gives more leverage to men who aren't willing to take care of the child they brought into this world probably due to their own negligence.

Consent occurs when one PERSON voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another

2. ""Risk"" is nothing to do with consent and is bastardizing the term to suit yourself. Stop, it's not working.

Alright so what happens if you do succeed to stop legal abortion? You disregard the woman’s circumstances (failed birth control, rape, incest, poverty, unsuitable environment, domestic violence, mental health issues, medical issues, lack of sex education). What happens next? Who will pay for prenatal and postnatal care? Not a couple or just a single mom living on minimum wage. What about a single mom who can’t even afford a place to live? What about who will help the millions of kids already in foster care being abused and no one adopting them especially the ones who are past toddler age? Then when they hit 18 they have no money and a lack of life skills due to their childhood? Will you actually put in the effort to provide better sex education? Are you willing to help medical or education costs? If you help get pregnancy outlawed, what role will you will you have in ensuring a good quality of life for the fetus you so desperately want to save? You are filled with delusions of superiority declaring yourself pro “life” when your compassion stops inside the vaginal canal. Don’t embarrass yourself and pretend you care about what happens after the fetus is born. Don’t pretend you care so much about innocent babies and kids when you sit by and do nothing to help those in need and just say women need to close their legs because that’s the easiest thing for you to do. You are just striving to make life worse for those struggling and don’t give two shits as long as your precious fetus survives because they “deserve a chance” even when their quality of life will be shit and traumatic and they will be wishing they were dead anyway. (got this from Facebook by Insufferably Intolerant Science Nerd with a slight tough from me).

To start things off, for a pregnancy to enter future stages the fertilized eggs actually has to implant itself in the uterus which is apart of the woman’s body. Yes the ZEF does have separate DNA but that doesn’t mean it is not a part of the mother by other means. The embryo stage lasts up to three weeks then becomes a fetus. At 6 weeks the embryo many anti choicers claim has a heartbeat. This “heartbeat” is not from a developed heart. It is just pulsating embryonic cardiac cells. According to data, about 90% of abortions happen by the latest at approximately 13 weeks. Only about 1-2% abortions are performed after 20 weeks. At thirteen weeks the fetus doesn’t even have intestines yet and the pregnancy bump is hardly noticeable. The fetus is the size of a lemon at this point. After 20 weeks is when the fetus can be at the point that it can survive out of the womb with much medical assistance. But, abortions after 20 weeks are not or very rarely because the person decided to change their mind. Pregnancies in later terms are due to medical complications from the mother or fetus or even both. There are cases when the fetus has a condition that cannot be treated and has no chance of survival and removing it at that point is actually more humane to the fetus. Don’t give that it deserves a chance BS. It was confirmed that it won’t survive or will just suffer along with the mother. That is just your emotions and or religious beliefs talking which has no place in science or the medical field. (already talked about but again added my touch).

Victims of rape develop trauma and deal with trauma in very different ways. There often is the fear of touch, nightmares, flash backs, helplessness, disintegrating self esteem, avoidance, eating problems, feeling of worthlessness and being disgusting. Many live in fear of it happening again and in the state of constant paranoia and fear. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions and so much more. If the rapist was very rough and more violent during the assault, the victims can receive internal and external tears and scarring. Emotional scarring is worse. Many rape victims also get told it was their fault and should have done something. Imagine being blamed for something so horrific that wasn’t your fault. Some are cruel enough to say they deserved it. Imagine what that does to a person. Men or women and yes that includes trans individuals and non-binary. Rape is a horrific and very traumatic thing to go through and needs to be seen how it is. If you can give sympathy to the trauma soldiers have suffered then rape victims deserve the same. They are all humans with feelings. Forcing someone to carry a reminder of their trauma is cruel and unscrupulous.

Many rapes result in PTSD. The trauma of rape is indescribable. Sexual assault is never the victim's fault. Ever. Even if the perpetrator was not a stranger. Your body is your own, and no one has permission to do anything against your wishes. Many women have said that they can’t describe the amount of trauma knowing their rapist is still inside them. For many it is a reminder of what they had suffered. Some have even said giving birth was like being raped all over again and triggered the memories. Many think it is okay to downplay the trauma of the rape victim and dismiss their trauma. Banning and preventing victims of rape abortion is forcing these survivors to live through more trauma. I don’t know about you but that seems pretty immoral and human torture. 

Much of anti choicers arguments are based off emotions and are trying to use pathos to convince others and appeal to their emotions by saying they are murdering quote “an innocent baby”. Sorry but your emotions don’t belong in someones medical and personal decisions. Many argue from their religious beliefs. Again religion has no place in the medical field or decisions of another. The colonizers created this country for separation from church in England and had the separation of church and state. Now you people are going against what the country was created for and then call yourselves proud Americans when that is not the American way. They gave religious freedom to practice, Not have it put in legal decisions. Also catholics and Christians seems to believe their god is against abortion. But let me remind you all that this is the same god who created Noahs flood that included children and babies, murdered Bathsheba’s newborn, killed all the firstborn sons of Egypt, sent bears to maul children, and commanded Joshua to kill all the children in Jericho. So that shoots down that argument right there. Argue all you want its in the Bible. If you guys are so devoted to your religion you can’t just pick and choose what you choose to believe for your own benefit to make yourself feel better. You just make yourself look stupid.

Now let’s talk about pregnancy and how it impacts the mother. But you people don’t really care because whether you can admit it or not you just see the mother as a thing carrying precious cargo and have a hard time acknowledging the mother as a human being with feelings. Pregnancy has a huge impact physically and mentally that can last after birth. But you guys don’t care about that. There are the typical morning sickness, hormones, swelling, hemorrhoids. But there are more serious effects as well. Yes SOME can be prevented with prenatals but that’s kinda hard for women in poverty that no one bothers to help. There have been cases of developing an autoimmune disease, cracked rips and pelvis, hemorrhaging during childbirth, your organs actually get displaced, with conflicting blood types there can be blood poisoning. The pupils can even be dilated and cause vision problems. Let’s not forget the women suffering from mental illnesses. With pregnancy hormone these can worsen the symptoms of mental illness. Women can also suffer from post partum depression and some even commit suicide. You all expect them to be so happy but sometimes that isn’t the case and that isn’t their fault but many seem to ignore that. Then childbirth is very agonizingly painful. There can be tearing from the vagina to the anus. That sounds fun right? Then getting a c-section by being cut open while awake yes there are drugs for that but I mean still getting cut open. Some say that’s taking the easy way out. How is being cut open easy. It takes time to recover from that. Many physical aspects from pregnancy can even last years to a lifetime. A woman body is never the same after pregnancy. Human heads are very large compared to other mammals. Yes get offended that I called you a mammal even though we are. The woman’s pelvis is narrow making childbirth way more painful and harder compared to other mammals. Then you also have rape, poverty, domestic violence. But even though many of you aren’t experiencing that you just KNOW it can’t be that bad right? As long as the “innocent baby” has its chance it what matters. Even if it is going into a shitty and traumatic life. There are fates worse than death and you all know it but won’t acknowledge it but as long as the kids alive is what matters right? Then there are millions of kids in the system wanting to be adopted, being abused things like that but yeah let’s keep adding to it and make the chance of them getting out even less. Also babies and young kids are more likely to be adopted. Most don’t really care about older kids. Many kids even struggle with the fact that they were given up by their parents and at times even struggle with self esteem and worth. Adoption is always an option but then women get shamed for not wanting or being able to keep them, So yeah we will force you to go through pregnancy and then get mad at you despite giving birth to it on your request but them shame them for not keeping. Hell I will offer you mine since I should stay pregnant. What you aren’t ready? What a shame. Okay guys you make total sense.

Those of you telling women to close their legs are just flat out dumb. It’s also pretty much misogynistic thinking. You seem to forget that women can’t just get pregnant on their own. Sperm has to be involved. None of you say anything about men having a lot of sex but when a woman does is she is a slut with no self respect. These thoughts and judgment are purely from societal thoughts. Birth control was created for a reason. You guys know that right? It was made for women who enjoy sex but don’t want to get pregnant. It can also fail but apparently that’s still her fault because she had sex. The responsibility is all on her and not the guy who impregnated her. She made the choice and now has to go through pregnancy willingly or unwillingly because that’s her job and all she’s good for and besides she was made for it anyway. Her mental and physical health don’t matter at all because you know, it all her fault. Some men are really whiny and throw tantrums about condoms but no big. Just more of a hassle on the pp rather than to prevent pregnancy and even STDs. Those without uteruses and especially cis men don’t have to go through pregnancy which isn’t a walk in the park and can even be dangerous and deadly. But that’s not their problem despite being part of the fertilization. Then they don’t even ask what would happen of she did get pregnant and would want an abortion. Then they get all upset when she doesn’t want to go through pregnancy. Yes I understand its yours as well but pregnancy isn’t easy and you aren’t the one going through all of it so it sucks but not you choice. Besides, y’all all fertile every day women are fertile for about 24 days a year. You can get any women pregnant at anytime. You can get a baby anytime you want if you want one so bad. But then some of you push women to get abortions because god forbid your reputation or marriage. We are a social species and sex is for connection and social interaction. Sex is pretty much a given in most relationships for the intimacy. We have evolved to where we no long rely on survival instincts. We can now process emotion and fall in love and want to have sex for reasons other than reproduction. We are now at a point where sex isn’t just for reproduction anymore and look there are 7 billion people. I think the human race is doing just fine.",t2_5jvnyuc7,1631039891,prochoice

DOJ vows to protect abortion seekers in Texas after ban goes into effect,"BY: [**Marlee Kokotovic**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/marlee-kokotovic/) \- September 7, 2021

Read the article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/07/doj-vows-to-protect-abortion-seekers-in-texas-after-ban-goes-into-effect/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/07/doj-vows-to-protect-abortion-seekers-in-texas-after-ban-goes-into-effect/)

Yesterday, Attorney General Merrick Garland says the Justice Department will continue to explore ways to fight Texas’ new anti-abortion law while protecting the safety of those seeking abortions in the state. 

“We will continue to protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services pursuant to our criminal and civil enforcement of the FACE Act,” says Garland.

According to [Huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/justice-department-will-protect-abortion-seekers-texas_n_6136776ae4b0aac9c01a8628), the FACE Act, or Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, is a federal law enacted in 1994 that bans physically obstructing or using the threat of force to injure, intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services. The law also prohibits intentional property damage at abortion clinics and other reproductive health centers.

“We will not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services, physical obstruction or property damage in violation of the FACE Act,” Garland said. 

This move comes just days after the Supreme Court refused to block a Texas abortion statute that bans the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. The court’s action stands as the most serious threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling establishing a right to abortion, in nearly 50 years, reports [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abortion-justice-department-biden-administration-texas/2021/09/06/f9cdc7ba-0f36-11ec-882f-2dd15a067dc4_story.html) 

President Joe Biden has criticized the Supreme Court’s decision saying their “overnight ruling is an unprecedented assault on constitutional rights and requires an immediate response.”

But the federal government only has so much power in circumstances like these. 

Ironically, Merrick Garland would have been a supreme court justice if Barack Obama had been able to get his nomination through when he was president, according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/06/doj-texas-abortion-law-merrick-garland).

"I changed my mind again, today","Until today, I took a softer stance on lifers based on my interactions with them, as well as my past self. I thought many of them thought rather simply and didn't think of the consequences of their beliefs.

But today, I saw a post here. A screenshot of lifers aiming to bar/outlaw no-fault divorce.

I talked to people who genuinely believe that fetuses are so precious, to abort them is the special evil of killing one's own child. They fancy themselves good people stopping a bad woman's hands from touching the innocent fetus. But, I also thought deeper about my past self: I remembered a point where I judged women who gave in to sexual desire, to jump into something very risky for a desire I did not understand at that time. At the end of the day, it comes from a place of judgement. Abstinence is the only fault free action. Sex becomes more life altering than it should be. It doesn't matter that you used protection: it's on you for giving up the 100% chance of not being pregnant. The defining trait of pro life/anti abortion is to judge and scorn the sex lives of others, even if its upholders genuinely believe they're saving babies from being aborted.

And with this judgement, comes control. If you are irresponsible, I'll make you responsible. If you're evil, I will make you good.

Why are pro-choice folks shooting themselves in the foot by implying that any point in pregnancy is fine for abortion?,"Sorry if I come off as anti-choice, I’m not, but take a look at some of the replies on [this thread.](https://twitter.com/legs_snail/status/1434744772195934210) 

No pushback against the core argument other than it won’t convince people. I don’t understand why you would say this. Isn’t the problem that we actually HAVE to arbitrarily find when a fetus becomes a baby? Like, an 8 month old fetus is just a baby basically, it’s just that if the birth were to endanger the mother at that point it’s still moral to abort it because a living adult is still much more of a person than a newborn. This sort of thing, I totally understand. 

But I thought the debate of abortion was nuanced and about the spectrum of consciousness. “Life begins at heartbeat” is wrong because OBJECTIVELY a braindead person is not alive while their heart beats. A small animal with a heartbeat does not have a human brain. The debate, at least I thought, just comes down to when a fetus becomes a human fetus, and where a human fetus becomes a person/baby, and the spectrum of permissions that should come with that. 

For example, a fetus is not conscious in a human manner, so it’s of least concern and abortion here is nothing more than halting a clump of cells. We mostly identify this with the first trimester, where 90% of abortions happen, and where if you aren’t religious (rejecting facts in favour of belief) or a complete dumbass you should understand that 1st trimester abortions mean nothing. In this phase a fetus looks like other fetuses from all of mammalia, it’s not yet a human fetus. Then, sometime in the 2nd trimester the brain is sufficiently developed that the baby is conscious, but even then it’s conscious to the point of a monkey with how it responds to stimuli and plays with you. But even that isn’t a reasonable cutoff. Instead when the human fetus is viable outside the body is when it attains its independence. That’s where the best point is for abortion. I don’t quite understand the mentality that goes into thinking it shouldn’t at least come with some difficulty to abort after that point, considering that the mother carried for that long and that it can be considered another body. Yes the other body is mooching off of yours, but so does a newborn baby. Should there not be at least some circumstantial requirements?

What I’m saying is that it’s a spectrum. During pre-humanhood, there isn’t anything that would morally bind you to not abort. During fetal humanhood, financial ruin should be enough of a reason. After viability, some qualifications may be needed. “Life begins at inception” or “the heartbeat” types are literally insane, but why are you going in the other direction so hard? Let me say again, something like 97% of abortions are pre-personhood anyways, and that should be our goal to normalize and make people understand why that isn’t killing a baby.

This absolutism doesn’t even make sense philosophically, and will only hurt the pro-choice cause. So why? What the fuck.",t2_8g1l55i,1630969464,prochoice

We won't get out of this sinking hole if we don't engage anti-choice people in conversation regularly (stop saying My Body My Choice to them.),"If you consider yourself to have above average debate skills, intelligence, aren't quick to anger, and can actually make some progress in challenging the illogical arguments/ beliefs of outspoken anti-choice people, PLEASE SPEAK UP. They are living in an echo chamber and being emboldened by either people who agree or people who do speak up but by using talking points that anti-choicers don't understand.

By not finding the right ways to explain why they are wrong, or by not saying anything at all to them, you're letting them win. They are voting and they're causing real suffering for us.

Go out and occasionally engage with them in a true discussion. Go out and use what you know to pull these people back into reality, without insults or attacking but with actual intent to turn misguided people back to logical reasoning on this complex subject. Just look at instagram, everyone from actual senators making these laws to young confused girls just trying to fit in are posting about this issue on social media. Don't let them post in an echo chamber.

For example- My Body My Choice arguments- they don't believe the fetus is your body so this means nothing at all to them. You're just \*furthering their belief that we're wrong\*. This is what you say to fellow pro-choice people, or post somewhere to show your support, but not what you say in a one-on-one conversation with someone who is extremely anti-choice.

Some points:

* The root of the problem - aside from the religious arguments (more on that later) the root of the problem is the ethical question of suffering. They don’t yet but may possibly understand the idea that an early-term fetus cannot suffer in the way that a uterus-having person can suffer from being forced to carry out that pregnancy. An early term fetus does not have the neural networks or brain architecture to feel actual pain or understand it.

\- They may counter with biased articles that claim fetuses recoil at stimuli and then they’ll say they “feel pain”, at which point you can counter with the simple fact that nerve impulses causing muscle movement does not always indicate pain and certainly does not in the case of fetuses without thinking and understanding capabilities. You can mention that even severed octopus arms and some bugs and sea creatures will “respond to stimuli"" after death, which clearly means nerve and muscle stimuli reaction, or movement, doesn’t always equate to pain/suffering.

\- Finally, you may want to point out that if its suffering or pain that is making them fight for anti-abortion bans, then they are being inconsistent and missing a very big point. Agree that pain should be considered, because it should. However, the person the fetus is inside of can and will feel significantly greater pain and suffering then an early term fetus can or will. You can appeal to their logic in that, if pain is what’s driving them, shouldn’t they be more concerned with the vaginal tearing, muscle separation, hospital visits from dehydration, severe vomiting, potential gestational diabetes, kidney infections, ligament pain, muscle aches and pains in the conscious person than they are with imaginary pain in the unconscious fetus? That by them fighting for this, its not a maybe that a literal child will go through those pains for the sake of a strangers emotional feelings about a non-thinking fetus, but they are very literally contributing to forcing a real child who exists today to experience that, and that should weigh on their conscience constantly.

* Use their own rationale - if you can get them to admit that a 12 year old rape victim should have the ability to remove an early-term pea-sized non-conscious fetal development from their uterus, you can then point out that they do, in fact, believe that early term fetuses will not suffer from removal and therefore even non-rape victims who can suffer should have the right to remove the fetus as well.
* Terminology- Anti-choice people love to keep throwing terms and definitions at you. Defining a term is not an argument, especially when they can’t explain what that actually means to them. For example, “its still a human!” As a gotcha. Ok, its biologically the stuff that makes up what’s defined as a human, that’s a definition. How does that relate to it being, so far, a non-thinking being causing pain and suffering to the actual thinking human being? “Its a person and there is ‘inherent value in all human life’”.. ok, what does that regurgitated talking point actually mean to you? That all human life is valuable and so all human life should be regulated by law to be preserved and allow for survivability? If that were true- they would be fighting equally as hard for mandatory blood donations, mandatory organ donation status, mandatory open borders and safe homes for refugee or asylum children (and adults, with inherent value), mandatory foster parent sign ups for anyone who claims to want to be a parent to prevent foster youth aging out into homelessness or suicide, mandatory free healthcare, not just mandatory pregnancy of an early term fetus. Unless they are doing all or most of the above, they do not believe in the inherent value of humans, but instead in the inherent value of developing fetuses that do not yet have consciousness. And if that’s the case, why do they have more value than others, everyone else that I’ve just listed?
* More terminology- the fetus has a brain, it has brain waves, neural tube, electrical brain activity etc… Here you go: “Even though the fetus is now developing areas that will become specific sections of the brain, not until the end of week 5 and into week 6 (usually around forty to forty-three days) does the first electrical brain activity begin to occur. This activity, however, is not coherent activity of the kind that underlies human consciousness, or even the coherent activity seen in a shrimp's nervous system. Just as neural activity is present in clinically brain-dead patients, early neural activity consists of unorganized neuron firing of a primitive kind. Neuronal activity by itself does not represent integrated behavior.” Pigs have neural activity, are they fighting for veganism?
* Last term point - I say potential person. A fetus is a potential person and y'all know what I mean by that. They're going to hit you with the "" Its not a potential person its a person! A person is a (insert copy and paste google search here)."" The definition of a person does not concern me. Developing fetal tissue without consciousness is a human growth that has the \*potential\* to be a conscious person. Thats just what it is, I still don't know how to get them to admit it has the potential to be a person but isn't equal to the real person its inside of yet so if y'all have tips on how to word what I'm trying to say here, or to get them to stop throwing googled word definitions at me as if that's a persuasive argument, please comment and help ya girl out.
* A different approach to What-aboutisms and what-ifs: “What if it could have been the person to cure cancer” I know we’re all tired of this one and honestly, if it gets to this point, you’re probably debating with someone who does not have the reasoning capabilities to ever allow them to see reality, or they’re 12. But, since it does still pop up sometimes and since the obvious rebuttal has already been used so many times (“what if? What if it’s the next hitler instead?”), here's a new one for ya- (continued on next point because it serves multiple purposes
* The fertilized embryo and developing person COULD be the next mother Theresa, you’re absolutely right. It could be the person to “cure cancer” .. so could the unfertilized egg in my uterus. Its a potential person too, right? I have a whole egg in my uterus just waiting for one single microscopic sperm cell and then boom! Its the next developing fetus in my uterus. Possibly the next person to cure cancer. If you’re forcing a person to carry a non-conscious fetal development from before its even able to think into the point where it is then able to think, at the sacrafice of her own wishes, then by your own rationale you shouldn’t stop there. You should force every uterus having person to fertilize those eggs and birth them too. After all, they are potential people too? They can also grow into babies in the same way a fertilized embryo can minus one microscopic sperm cell? Fertilized embryos needs LOTS of cells and biological material to be given to them by the mothers body in order to turn into a baby which you’re totally ok with, non-fertilized eggs only need one little cell to turn into fertilized embryos? No? You don’t want to force women and uterus having people into fertilizing those eggs with inherent human value? Then don’t force them into carrying a non-conscious fetus into the point of consciousness.
* These are not even addressing the politicians views but just your casual anti-choice voter. If you want more info on why politicians make anti-abortion bills, look up the poverty trap and then go to [FollowTheMoney.org](http://followthemoney.org/) and look up who pays the politician.
* Religion: Here we go, I’ll do my best not to go into the obvious :/

First I’ll say what I’ve tried to explain throughout- be in their head. Think like them. If you want to broach the topic of religion because they’ve brought up religion, you need to find the logical work arounds that they are actually capable of understanding given their beliefs.

1. Afghanistan is primarily muslim, should christians in that country have to have laws that are solely based on the muslim religion imposed on them? If no, then why does your religion get to impose laws on non-religious people based on the Bible in your country?
2. If we can fine or punish women for aborting a non-conscious fetus, why not fine non-christians for not adhering to “have no other God before me”, the literal first commandment? Because you already know laws shouldn’t be based on religion. At some level you already know and don’t want to admit that the Bible is inconsistent and doesn’t always lead to living or having a good life and so it can’t be used as the basis for a moral argument about real life. Why not fine actually Christians for working on the seventh day, the Sabbath, or for using Gods name in vain? Why not set up websites that allow people to snitch on cheating spouses for a $10,000 bounty (looking at you, Texas)? Why not enact a law that adult children have to honor their parents? If your religion ends at protecting a fetus, you’re not religious.
3. If religious undertones are still pressed, then of course, theres The Ordeal of The Bitter Water, in which God doesn’t consider the fetus a person but rather as a tool to punish the cheating wife. He didn’t consider the fetus then, why should we? (“Oh that’s the Old Testament!”- this is the point you know you’re debating with a fake christian, leave immediately! “Oh that passage said ‘wasting of the thigh,’ not ‘wasting of the womb/ miscarry/ abortion”- this is the point you know you’re debating with an absolute moron or someone arguing in bad faith and willing to play dumb to get what they want, proceed with caution. You can look up and quote the many different versions of the Bible that translate this passage as “wasting of the womb/ miscarry” and quote them to this person, thereby pointing out another great point and that is that the Bible was written thousands of years ago in separate sections in which many of the sections that people use as \*general life commandments\* were actually just some guy named Paul giving a single speech to a very specific group of people and telling them what they should or shouldn’t do when they get to a new city, not God talking directly to you, Karen. That what the Bible says we should or shouldn’t do changed over time based on how society developed, such as commanding us not to eat certain things and acting like its for God when really it was just because that speech was given to a mob of people during a time when that specific animal often came with diseases, then later in the Bible you were suddenly allowed to eat that animal again. Because you know, hundreds of years had passed and there were advances in how people understood to prepare that food. the Bible also tells you not to wear clothes with mixed fabrics, do you think God is telling you not to wear that dress you like a lot that’s a fabric blend? No, some guy who was the modern day equivalent of Moses’s assistant was telling that to the people who were Israelites in that day and age.

Mainly my point is: There are actually some anti-choice activists, usually children who just don't have enough life experience yet, who do actually have the potential to be decent people and who do have their heart in the right place. Understand that when you see it and address it. I've seen the younger generation say ""well I didn't want to be vocal about it, but then I realized if I lived in the time of slavery and didn't fight for the slaves I would have been in the wrong."" Ok, yeah, I get you. Thats a super valid almost-point.. you WANT to be the good person and help others. The problem is that you're fighting for the wrong ""side"" then. To equate early-term non-thinking non-conscious fetal development to enslaved black people in the 1800's is one of the most accidentally or non-accidentally racist things I've ever heard. The enslaved people felt suffering and pain, people being forced to carry out a full term pregnancy when they could have simply removed the non-thinking fetal development at an early stage feel suffering and pain, the fetus does not. If you are actively advocating for unnecessary suffering of consious, real people for the sake of a ""potential"" person.. you would not have been on the ""right side"" of slavery back in the day.

TLDR: Ultimately it boils down to this- a sane, non-psychotic individual would not impose long-term suffering and frequent painful/scary situations on a real, conscious person for the sake of an unconscious fetus turning into a conscious person one day. They would not forcefully take blood or extra kidneys from an unwilling person to give to a dying person, even though it has “inherent value of human life”. They wouldn’t inflict pain on others for their claimed religious beliefs while largely ignoring every other religious commandment (house the homeless, feed the poor, honor the parent, stone the cheater, give up everything you own, etc). So why this fight? Because it makes them \*feel\* icky, because money (for politicians), because they need to have control over others, or because they have nothing else in their life that lets them feel superior to others so they have to play pretend in this belief system to hurt others to feel a sense of superiority (but don’t tell them that- remember my point on being not quick to anger if you’re interested in actually changing minds/votes).

They won’t stop at abortion,"I don’t want to scare people, but I want people to know this. If the politicians trying to overturn Roe v Wade succeed (and it is looking like that is a strong possibility) they won’t stop at abortion. They can’t - the issue of abortion is too successful for them. It energized parts of their base that never would have voted if it weren’t for abortion. And because of that, they can’t just drop it once Roe is overturned. Instead, they *will* come for birth control. I know right now that probably sounds preposterous and unrealistic, but lawmakers are already trying to do this. Example: [Ohio lawmakers tried this in 2019.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statenews.org/government-politics/2019-05-07/ohio-legislature-considering-abortion-ban-more-restrictive-than-heartbeat-bill%3f_amp=true)
IUDs would probably be their first target. Some pro-lifers consider them [“abortifacient.”](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/05/391030821/colorado-debates-whether-iuds-are-contraception-or-abortion) They will keep moving the goalposts, keep coming up with more twisted logic for how different forms of birth control somehow cause abortions, and if left unchecked, they will completely erode reproductive rights. This is why everyone needs to care about this abortion fight. If we lose, they *will* take more and more.

Just want to share some info here because I don't wanna lose karma on pro-life subreddit.,"1. Full human DNA (genome) is roughly 700 MB of information, 99% of which is the same for all humans.
2. On the other hand, the size of all information in the adult cerebral cortex (""smart brain"") theoretically can be calculated as \~75 TB. It's 100,000 times more information than in DNA.
3. Brain starts learning and developing as soon as baby is born. In a womb, there is almost no information. No input data = no learning = empty mind.
4. Fetus is just a bunch of cells with DNA. Also, saliva also have full DNA. Is spitting a crime against life?
5. All over the world, doctors make decisions about disabling life support systems for people that are in a coma for a long time, and that seems to be unrecoverable. Their mind and personality are developed, most of the memories and skills are still there, but their brain is turned off due to damage. With progress in science and technology, medics will be able to recover more of these people. But to stay alive longer for people in a coma, money needs to be spent on their life support.

The Ethics Of Restricting Abortion And Follow-up Legislation,"I will start by expressing that I am about as pro-life as they come outside my abolitionist contemporaries. I'm secular, viewing religion as arguably one of the greatest detractors to any pro-life movement or argument as religion is, in its nature, fallacious. For me, a model world is one where abortion is not acceptable from the state nor from the societal ethical frameworks that shape political socialization. The only exception that shall persist is the result of objective physical or mental dangers, (i.e. ""Tube Pregnancy"" or Advanced Suicidal Tendencies). The basis of my pro-life argument, coming not from religion, comes from a value placed on human life. Of course, human life's value is a creation of humanity itself, but I feel it is one worth holding in high regard. I don't doubt that the majority of pro-choicers nor pro-lifers have conflicts of the importance of human life. Instead the disagreement, as is all too common the case, steams from the debate on the initiation of life. Fertilization is when life begins. The biological basis for this assertion is well established. I base my personal ethics on fertilization being the moment that life begins from DNA individuality, among other factors. I don't doubt that many in this sub will agree that the process of life starts at conception. However, this does not always imply something is alive, as is often seen in this sub. I personally do not separate fertilized eggs, zygote, Embryos, fetuses, or born humans. They all share the characteristics of life; being on the biological process of fertilization to death. This is what drives my pro-life views as I cannot nor do I believe I should separate these sub-groups out of convenience or dehumanization. However, being pro-life must not stop at birth as is always an assertion seen in pro-choice movements. There must be support for adoption and foster care reform, free contraception, increased welfare and physical and mental health services for mothers, mantatory paid maternity leave, reformed sex education that teaches of safe sex, etc...",t2_493y7u8i,1630922117,prochoice
"I've been on the fence, but Texas just threw me over it.","I grew up Christian and for most of my youth I was hardcore pro-life.

I know so many people who are completely against vaccination requirement/mandates who are 100% in favor of what's going on in Texas. If you're okay with women being in violation of the law for having an abortion, you better be okay with the government holding you down and shoving a needle in your arm. This is not about what's ethically right or wrong, it is about what is and what isn't the government's fucking business. I'm not personally on board with convenience abortions at all, but as we've seen with the war on drugs, prohibition, guns, and prostitution, making something illegal doesn't fix jack shit or create any positive change.

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1630915230,prochoice

ProLife said a woman HAS to give her body for the fetus..,"Made a post to ask in r/ProLife

Basically: if a woman has a right to her own body, but just doesn’t have the right to the fetus body, then she would be able to remove the still-alive fetus from her body, win win for everyone!

Instantly got disagreed with, because the fetus would eventually die. 

So ProLifers only care that the woman must give her body for the fetus because it’s the only way the fetus can live..despite that the woman has no ownership over the fetus and ProLife often argue that both are independent bodies..

Guess this shows that ProLifers just want women to be incubators for 9 months and then give birth; informing the fact that it is painful, increases health complications, can lead to death, isn’t always consent and that there’s a big difference between a red circle and a 1 day old baby",t2_e337a8om,1630903355,prochoice
"""150 Babies Saved""","Lets go! We just saved 150 babies a day thanks to the abortion ban in Texas-Prolifers

I think this line of thinking shows precisely how delusional these people are. They really do think that banning abortion stops women from having them. It just makes what should be an accessible medical procedure incredibly dangerous. Women desperate and in need would just go back to using clothes hangers like they did before. The fact that can cause organ damage shows how important reproductive healthcare was to those women back then. I think that these people want to pretend the world is perfect, and very black and white. One person said that rape victims wouldn't be sued by their rapist under the new law because the rapist would already be on trial. That's cute, seeing that a small percentage of rape cases actually go to court. Their world is like a straight line, and women who want abortions are automatically unholy fornicators/whores. They couldn't possibly be anyone else other than someone who has a bunch of one night stands. It couldn't be maybe the married couple next door to them or anything. As a Canadian, what's going on in the U.S is next level crazy for me. An abortion is a deeply personal matter, and I don't quite understand why these people have such an obsession with women's uteruses. It's someone elses business but they care so much.

Will women like me who have molar pregnancies/choriocarcinoma still be able to receive a D&amp;C in Texas with the new Anti-Abortion Law? Can they be sued?,"Three years ago I had a molar pregnancy that turned into choriocarcinoma (a rare cancer of the uterus). For those unaware choriocarcinoma occurs when abnormal cells grow from the tissue that would have been the placenta later on in pregnancy. Not all molar pregnancies end up developing into cancer. The only way to stop the abnormal tissue from growing is to have a D&amp;C. There are plenty of women who experience a molar pregnancy, get a D&amp;C, and then go on after to have healthy pregnancies in the future. But sometimes the tissue can grow back *after* a D&amp;C. If it *does* grow back then this is where chemotherapy starts. An oncologist will try and eliminates the harmful tissue from spreading to other parts of your body.

So now for my question. I'm very curious as to what will happen to women like me in Texas. If you have a molar pregnancy and need a D&amp;C (which many pro-lifers still consider a form of abortion since the tissue needs to be scraped out) will they be able to receive one? Will anybody be able to randomly sue them for simply having a D&amp;C even though the pregnancy isn't viable in any possible way/could lead to cancer or death? Maybe I'm overthinking this too much but if anyone has an answer I'd appreciate it.

TLDR; Will women who need D&amp;Cs still be able to receive one/not get sued if the pregnancy isn't viable?",t2_4hlz138k,1630895345,prochoice

The cognitive/psychological consequence of abortion.,"In the wake of the passing of the Texas heartbeat bill I am seeing numerous social media posts regarding reasons (typically appealing to pathos and ethos) voicing opinions against or in favor the bill. But I see no one talking about this: 
First I make disclaimer I am pro-choice for four specific reasons and the fourth reason is the one I see no one speaking about.
1. Personal autonomy&gt;non maleficence (the government should not dictate within this level of privacy medical decisions of individuals)
2. Rape, incest, medical
3. Significant health risk associated with abortion would act as a deterrent: “safe, legal, rare”



Now the one I see no one talking about:
4. Psychological consequences of having an abortion will be sufficient “punishment” as an outcome of an abortion, there is no need to create legal penalties. 

-When a woman gets an abortion this is going to be something that is going to take a great physiological and psychological toll on her body that I believe most people who are pro choice are not aware of-specifically the psychological aspect. One only needs to go so far as to read into Carl Jung’s description of the shadow to get an understand as to why this is so. But this is also going to be magnified IF the woman get’s an abortion as means of contraception. To put it succinctly this is due to the fact that they are cutting responsibility for their actions which will always lead to subvert neurosis. Not only where there be a conscious stress from the decision and procedure due to the explicit magnitude of what an abortion is but most importantly an abortion will undoubtedly cause unconscious “difficulties” for the future psychological integrity of the woman and they will likely have no idea that this is going on. So I would consider it unwise from allowing this “natural” psychological phenomenon from taking place as it would be preventing an outcome that has individualistic potential for development.",t2_khlnim,1630891907,prochoice

"""What It Was Like"", by Ursula K. Le Guin","What It Was Like
A talk given at a meeting of Oregon NARAL in January 2004.

 

 

My friends at NARAL asked me to tell you what it was like before Roe vs. Wade. They asked me to tell you what it was like to be twenty and pregnant in 1950 and when you tell your boyfriend you’re pregnant, he tells you about a friend of his in the army whose girl told him she was pregnant, so he got all his buddies to come and say, “We all fucked her, so who knows who the father is?” And he laughs at the good joke.

They asked me to tell you what it was like to be a pregnant girl—we weren’t “women” then—a pregnant college girl who, if her college found out she was pregnant, would expel her, there and then, without plea or recourse. What it was like, if you were planning to go to graduate school and get a degree and earn a living so you could support yourself and do the work you loved—what it was like to be a senior at Radcliffe and pregnant and if you bore this child, this child which the law demanded you bear and would then call “unlawful,” “illegitimate,” this child whose father denied it, this child which would take from you your capacity to support yourself and do the work you knew it was your gift and your responsibility to do: What was it like?

I can hardly imagine what it’s like to live as a woman under Fundamentalist Islamic law. I can hardly remember now, fifty-four years later, what it was like to live under Fundamentalist Christian law. Thanks to Roe vs. Wade, none of us in America has lived in that place for half a lifetime.

But I can tell you what it is like, for me, right now. It’s like this: If I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents through the pregnancy, birth, and infancy, till I could get some kind of work and gain some kind of independence for myself and the child, if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, for the anti-abortion people, the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have borne a child for them, their child.

But I would not have borne my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children.

The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses, or children, or lives, or whatever you choose to call them: my children, the three I bore, the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband—whom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met and married, because he would have been a Fulbright student going to France on the Queen Mary in 1953 but I would not have been a Fulbright student going to France on the Queen Mary in 1953. I would have been an “unwed mother” of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents, not marriageable, contributing nothing to her community but another mouth to feed, another useless woman.

But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves. If I had not broken the law and aborted that life nobody wanted, they would have been aborted by a cruel, bigoted, and senseless law. They would never have been born. This thought I cannot bear. I beg you to see what it is that we must save, and not to let the bigots and misogynists take it away from us again. Save what we won: our children.

What exactly is an abortion and what count?,"so i need 2 question answer

1. What is the definition of abortion
2. What count as abortion

I try looking at different definition and I got similar explanation but different to wear depending on the definition some thing may or may not count as abortion

* Google definition  

   * the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy.
* merriam-webster  

   * the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus: such as
   * **a:** spontaneous expulsion of a human fetus during the first 12 weeks of gestation— compare MISCARRIAGE
   * **b:** induced expulsion of a human fetus
   * **c:** expulsion of a fetus by a domestic animal often due to infection at any time before completion of pregnancy— compare CONTAGIOUS ABORTION
* britannica.com  

   * **abortion**, the expulsion of a fetus from the uterus before it has reached the stage of viability (in human beings, usually about the 20th week of gestation). An abortion may occur spontaneously, in which case it is also called a miscarriage, or it may be brought on purposefully, in which case it is often called an induced abortion.
* dictionary.com  

   * Also called **voluntary abortion.** the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy.
   * any of various surgical methods for terminating a pregnancy, especially during the first six months.
* If I try looking for specifically the medical definition I get this from medlineplus.gov  

   * An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy. It uses medicine or surgery to remove the embryo or fetus and placenta from the uterus. The procedure is done by a licensed health care professional.

so those are the one I got from looking up the definition which definition should I go with, I am thinking about going with the medical definition since abortion is a medical procedure.

then we have got all the different type of of abortion

1. I just found out that Therapeutic medical abortion are a thing, well more like I found out that was the correct term
2. Miscarriage are technically abortion from my research
3. are there any more type of abortion beside the more commonly Elective abortion that I am missing. cause depending on the definition I go with wouldn't a C section count as abortion?",t2_dro2ibqm,1630858168,prochoice

brief mention of rape, non detailed. 

Is the fucking ignorance of real life situations about who these bans will actually affect. 

I’m not sure what fantasy world they live in where the only people having kids are adult women who are out sleeping around. I’m also not sure what fantasy world they live in where women are actually believed about rape, let alone the man be actually prosecuted for it. I really wish I could live in this world where the law is just and black women and people of color were treated the same and given the same opportunities. 

I’d like to live in this world where apparently, as a black woman, my maternal death rate is not higher!! 

I’d very much like to live in this world where poverty and homelessness weren’t such a reality for such a large portion of people. 

But just from a quick scroll on their page I learned in that world, they don’t want gay people to adopt, they don’t believe in robust social programs for the poor, and they don’t believe in free pre and post partum support for parents. 

So the only fucking “person” they are ever really fighting for are those fucking embryos. 

I will never stop shouting my abortion in the face of this. On Friday night I was able to have it, and I’ve never felt fucking better mentally, emotionally, or physically.

"""Even people who oppose abortion should fear Texas’s new ban""","[Even people who oppose abortion should fear Texas’s new ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/19/texas-sb8-abortion-lawsuits/)

Putting this article as a text post instead of a link because I want people to understand: this goes beyond reproductive rights.

This goes beyond the abortion debate.

SB8 is a dangerous tactic to get around Constitutionally protected rights. *All* constitutionally protect rights, not just abortion. While the law bothers me from an abortion stand point, I recognized this additional issue early on and I despise this law, not just for what it says about abortion rights, but for what it says about all rights.

I am sure you have heard ""religious freedom"" thrown around a lot. This idea that a religious institution should be allowed to not be held to honoring the constitutional rights of other citizens citing that it is a violation of their rights. 

This ""religious freedom"" has become code for ""bigotry."" As AOC aptly pointed out, the only time that phrase is uttered is in the name of bigotry and discrimination. And it goes against the very reason we have protections like that in the first place. (AOC provided a brilliant exposition on her take that you can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upa2Rk_Y1Z0).)

Let's be clear: not being able to stop someone from engaging in xyz *does not* violate your religious rights. Telling you that you cannot do xyz is telling you that *you can't violate the rights of others*. And telling you that you can't violate other people's rights does **not** violate **yours**. You don't have the right to impose your religious views onto others. And since that isn't a right, it isn't a violation of your rights to not be able to, say, offer birth control as a part of your health care package.

So SB8 is all too familiar with what it is suggesting: a way to get around all constitutionally protected rights that you disagree with.

Currently, it is basically saying that it doesn't need to be verified against the Constitution because it just side steps it and walks around it. It is making it so the Constitution is effectively pointless.

But it doesn't just do that for bodily autonomy rights. It sets the legal precedent for this to be done to all rights.

Key point from the article, 3rd paragraph from the bottom: 

&gt; The law would also have vast ramifications for our system of governance. If permitted to take effect, S.B. 8 would supply a ready blueprint for any state or locality looking to target federal rights they dislike. Today it is Texas banning abortion; tomorrow, New York could ban gun sales, permit anyone to sue gun buyers or sellers, and offer a five-figure bounty to entice endless private lawsuits. Post certain conservative sentiments on Facebook? A state could authorize lawsuits by anyone who saw your post. Same-sex couples could be sued by neighbors for obtaining a marriage license. Unpopular political groups could be barred from gathering under threat of vigilante lawsuits. The possibilities are endless. 

And so this is why every single person should be afraid of this law, regardless of your feelings on abortion.

It isn't a win by any means.

I could literally get into political power and propose a law that effectively says that anyone who votes prolife can be sued or have their family members sued. No more posting your prolife beliefs on your social media account - I now have the right to sue you for violating my conscious. And ""religious freedom"" has paved the path for the claim that what *you do* effects ***my rights*** and I have a right to have a say over what you believe and how you vote. Because reasons apparently.",t2_6gi7y,1630824412,prochoice

Struggling with my decision.,"Hi all. I’m writing this looking for advice, I guess. I’ve already had one abortion and it honestly made me feel pretty crappy, and I remember thinking I wouldn’t do it again. However, I just learned I’m pregnant again, and I really do not want to go through with it. Solely based off of the stigma, and religious purposes. I’m not the most religious person, and I don’t believe in the pro-life movement. However, whenever I speak with someone about it I feel as if I’m being condemned. I feel as if in my heart morally it isn’t right for me to do again. (Obviously no hate to anyone who has done this more than once. It’s your body!) I know I don’t need to justify my decision to anyone, however I’m not thinking of aborting it for any other reason than not wanting to be a parent. I don’t think I would be a good one. My husband and I are financially stable, own a beautiful house, have pretty much everything we want. And I fear for that coming to an end by bringing a new life into the world. Anyone have advice on how I should navigate this one?",t2_cmme5rhh,1630816817,prochoice
"In Texas, can I be charged with aiding and abetting in an abortion for posting a link to sites where women can get help on my Facebook?","I recently found some sites here on Reddit thanks to a friendly user where you can buy FDA approved abortion pills and that also give information on how to safely use them.

I shared these links on my Facebook, and somewhat obviously falsely worded it like I was ""warning"" my fellow Texans about these sites and that ""they should let all their texan friends know to avoid these sites"" with links in the post ""so they can see what the homepage looks like, to avoid them better""

A friend of mine brought to my attention that this could possibly be construed as aiding and abetting someone to get an abortion, and I don't want to delete the post, but also don't want to go to jail, as I'm on probation for a marijuana charge currently.

Disrupting the Prolife Whistleblower website does not mean suits can’t be filed.,"This is just a reminder that the website is not an official state tool for filing suit against an abortion provider or someone who helps a woman obtain an abortion. While we certainly should do what we can to hinder these frivolous and harassing suits, the website does not actually start a suit or launch an official investigation. Anyone unable to use the website to have a “prolife” organization file suit, can just as easily go to their local courthouse to file suit or call the organization if they don’t want to file themselves. 

Spamming the website is certainly something we can and should do, but it is only one form of activism.

An open letter to health insurance companies regarding coverage for tubal litigations,"Hello,

I understand your insurance plans do not cover voluntary tubal litigations. In light of a recent Supreme Court decision, I implore your company to please reconsider. Many women, myself included, are terrified we may be forced to be mothers, should our contraceptives fail. Paying out of pocket for sterilization surgery is something many of us cannot afford, and birth control is not 100% effective. 

Please note that covering tubal litigations would save your company millions of dollars, since pregnancy and childbirth expenses are very high in the US. Therefore, this coverage is beneficial on both ends. If I my insurance plan offers maternity coverage now, it should also recognize our decision not to use it. Providing tubal litigations will allow Texas women to get some autonomy back, which we so desperately need right now. 

Thank you for your time",t2_895g15qt,1630770143,prochoice
I'm looking for pro-choice opinions on the following examples.,"These examples probably could have been made a bit succinct, but I think they provoke the questions I'm driving at, which is mainly ""why is the line in the sand of pro-lifers that it's fine to kill a fetus inside the body, but 18 inches away outside the body it tranfers to one of the most heinous crimes imaginable"".

Lets say a woman is in a hospital for an abortion. She is healthy, so is fetus. She has tons of money, could provide the fetus a great life, but instead she wants to continue her life as a single woman for selfish reasons. So, according to you, her selfish desire to party as a single woman Trump's the fetus' right to not be killed. You said you value them the same... I just don't see how you can say a woman's right to party Trumps another organism's right to not be killed if they're the same value. Personally I value the woman more, because she's conscious, has memory, and can feel pain in a greater way. And I value the fetus less, because it's none of those things(conscious, memory, pain). So, thus, I allow the greater value organism to kill the lesser value one, even if it's for a relatively mundane reason like ""wanting to be able to keep partying as a single woman"".

But, I digress. She's getting an abortion. In the hospital. She's vacationing in Somalia(bad vacation spot, but that's what she wants). The doctor there claims to have performed 10,000 abortions with no complications. Woman gets put under. Wakes up doctor says it's a success, fetus is dead. And he taped the whole thing.

She watches the video. To her shock, this doctor's method of abortion was to simply take the live fetus out, then kill it by snapping its neck. So, you're saying that's a straight up murder? But alternatively, if the doctor had killed the fetus 2 seconds earlier while it was in the womb, it's 100% fine?

See, that's my struggle with your POV. I don't think moving a fetus 18 inches transforms the act of killing it from ""100% fine"" to ""one of the worst crimes imaginable"". I think that's a false ""line in the sand"" that pro-lifers have drawn, that really has no logical reasoning IMO. It doesn't hurt the organism more either way... yet one is a reprehensible crime, and the other is just fine.

Let me maybe phrase it another way.

Lets pretend abortions are found out to have serious negative side effects on the health of woman, regardless of how they are performed. For whatever reason, having a fetus die inside you takes 20 years off your life. So, the option is, have an abortion inside the womb. Or simply have the baby naturally, at 3 months early, then kill it when it comes out.

With the ""normal"" abortion, it will hurt the mother's health massively, and the organism dies a few seconds earlier. With the ""post birth abortion"", the mother's health is unperturbed, and the organism dies a few seconds later.

Are you really willing to actively hurt women's health, and take 20 years off their life just to kill the organism while it's still in the womb? The point of this example isn't to be accurate to real life. It's to find out just how much you are willing to sacrifice to keep up this idea that moving the fetus 18 inches out of the womb really transforms the situation all that much.

Personally, it's not even a hard decision to me. Have the fetus, then kill it when it comes out. Save 20 years of the woman's life. It's not worth losing 20 years of a woman's life, just to do the fetus the favor of killing it while it's still inside the womb. The fetus/infant doesn't care either way. And if the fetus/infant doesn't care, why would you even CONSIDER taking 20 years off a woman's life?",t2_ds3kaez5,1630767752,prochoice

I can’t make up my mind about abortion.,"I know many good arguments pro choice and many pro life and I can’t make up my mind. 

When it comes to just a few cells it’s okay for me to do an abortion. It’s when a baby forms that I’m not sure. 

“It’s your body your choice”. I like this very much but not enough to be convinced sadly. You should be able to do anything with your body but this is different, this is an individual. 

But when actually is it an individual? As I said I don’t care about some cells. We kill many human cells everyday without killing someone.  
But I feel like it’s different with cells that forms a baby. Sure it is unconscious but there are unconscious people we don’t kill. Sure it’s basically on life support but we don’t kill people on life support. It might not be able to have an independent metabolism but we don’t kill people with pacemakers. 

Please destroy my arguments because I really want to be on your side.",t2_81uj3nnq,1630762170,prochoice
the texas abortion law: a,"Now to clarify, I am a young Roman catholic. I say this as it is key to understanding the contents of this post and why it was made.I also wrote this in an attempt to dispel some of the negativity that the catholic church, and other branches of the faith, have incurred in the abortion debate.

On my position on the matter, i am sort of what people would call pro-life (in a sense), but i object to the constant attempts to limit abortions, due to how unsafe abortions become when they are illegal and how women suffer because of it, not only physically, but mentally as well due to society’s view towards those who have abortion. To be honest, i view abortion as a bit unsettling, but perhaps necessary. It would not be right for me to oppose it. It is something you must think about seriously, not do it on a whim. I hope that anyone who is reading this and has either had an abortion before or is about to have one would never do the latter. That would be ridiculous. But there may be a small number who do. 

I detest the ant-abortion campaigners, as they have waged a campaign of harassment and lawsuits of dubious legality. The fact that it has caused so much division and the issue is being wielded as a club in political arenas is upsetting. The fact that it has caused some to leave the church saddens me, for it means the churches made them feel unwelcome over the issue. I ask you not to judge all catholics too harshly on the issue, as their are many who support the pro choice movement.

When the new law was passed, i was very shocked. It not only overturns roe v wade, but the fact that texans can now sue people and organisations for tens of thousands of dollars over something that is very much a private medical matter is immoral. It is highly dubious and creates a culture of fear and betrayal. The way the supreme court handled raise serious questions on their authority. The fact that they did this without legal arguments against it even having a chance of being said is very dangerous and sets a bad precedent. What they have done is highly illegal and destructive. It must be overturned! 

The reason i wrote this is a little complicated. I guess im at the same time venting, apologising on behalf of others and at the same time trying to say that people usually possess inconsistent views on things. What matters is how you deal with that and make sure you dont make too many exceptions when it comes to morals. Tis natural to belief in ideas that clash somewhat. 

God Bless all reading this.

p.s i hope this comes off as civil. tis rather hard for me to express my views in writing, so the quality is not the best.",t2_drytc9w9,1630761827,prochoice

"Choosing to have an abortion is and should be a difficult choice, but sometimes it's the best or only choice available","Quick disclaimer: I am male, and also happen to be a virgin if that matters. 

Anyways, I just have a few thoughts I want to share. 

I think that too much political focus is on legality of abortions rather than the actual human experiences which lead to them. 

I'm not the first or last person to say that universal comprehensive sex-ed is usefull for this, but what about advancing technologies related to reproduction. 

If we were somehow able to reliably detect a pregnancy easily and cheaply within the first week of contraception, then the choice could be made before the ""first heartbeat"" (or whatever milestone that is so important), and the choice could be made hopefully somewhat less controversial. 

Or what if there were a way to transplant the pre-fetus cells to another host allowing for the embryo to survive outside the original host. 

Or what if we were to create and use more effective protection/sterilization like a less intrusive and easily reversible ""tube tying"" or vasectomy or even just ""less boring condoms"" or something. 

Basically accidental/unwanted contraception is going to happen and I (perhaps naively) think that technology can and will give us better options given that we spend the resources to research it. 

Nobody in the world wants to have an abortion for no reason. Many people are extremely sensitive on the topic. I just wish there was more effective work being done rather than this needless fighting over more/less restrictions. 

I hope you all have an excellent day!",t2_jn8xl,1630721567,prochoice

I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.

I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.

I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.

I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11 year old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.

I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.

I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.

I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction in order to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE amount of fetuses.

I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.

I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.

I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.

I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.

You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.

You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted.

It's not about which stories you don't agree with. It's about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the CHOICE that was made.

Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!

I was wondering if there were any funds or organizations that collected funds to provide or support vasectomies for men who couldn’t afford it?

It may sound kind of weird, but I was just thinking about ways we could involve pro-choice men in the fight to prevent unwanted pregnancies - whether abortion is taken off the table or not?

Perhaps men only consider vasectomies for older people or people who have already had children? Perhaps they can’t afford it? Perhaps they are misinformed on the procedure? Or just in general, don’t feel like it is for them?

But perhaps, given the opportunity, there could be an organization that helps men who are not trying to have children anytime soon obtain a vasectomie, in turn, reducing the frequency of unwanted pregnancies on the mans side.

Obviously, comprehensive sex education, access to birth control &amp; safe abortion are priority. I was just thinking of how we could involve &amp; offer ways to support men in the conversation. After all, it takes two to tango.

I’d love to hear thoughts or if something like this already exists! Or if something like this would be beneficial!",t2_3e3fw144,1630695551,prochoice

"Trying to contact people from Wisconsin or Tucson, AZ","Hello all

So I want to start working with people or talking to people in the two areas for a couple of different reason.  If you are in Tucson, I wondered if you wanted to do walks around town to raise awareness protest non violently.  I looked at womens march Tucson but they don't seem to have anything going on.  Also, not sure where or what the laws are for picketing/marching/protesting in AZ and would like to know where those would be.  Some safety in numbers would be good though.  I don't mean this as brigading, I just think people need to get out. If that counts as that then please tell me.  

For people in Wisconsin, if you have good contacts for the representatives and which ones need to be hit hard.

Thought; it is risky to be friends with pro-lifers. Ditch them.,"So, obviously prolifers wherever they are will fight for fascist laws to ban abortion.

Thing is, women can still secretly get abortions both in state and out of state.

HOWEVER if a ban is in place &amp; you are pregnant &amp; you/she trusts or is friends with a prolifer/s, they may dob her in to the ""report"" sites or authorities, so that they can personally benifit from the woman.

Hence I feel pretty safe since I am not friends with any prolifers.

But I can easily imagine other women thinking they can trust their prolife friend, only to be switched by them.

Plus why would you want to be friends with people who literally want to force you to stay pregnant &amp; give birth, it's inhumane &amp; degrading. Modern day fascism.",t2_5vlvig8t,1630692101,prochoice

Being pregnant made me child free! Shouting my very much wanted abortion.,"Cross posted in r/childfree 

Hi y’all! I’m a first time poster in this lovely group. 

I’m 8 weeks pregnant this week and feeling like crap. I’ve felt like crap since week 6. It’s all the bullshit that most pregnant people complains about: sore breasts, nausea, body pains and aches, headaches, the freaking works. I have never felt worse in my body than I do being pregnant. 

The one thing I didn’t expect was to become staunchly childfree through this experience. There is nothing in me that remotely sparked as maternal. I feel gross, exhausted, and overwhelmed. I described this fetus as a parasite when a friend of mine asked how I was doing. I’ve already been dreaming of what I want to do when my energy comes back. 

But more than anything, there was nothing in my soul that felt going through nine months of this was worth what would be on the other end. 

It just wasn’t there for me. The baby at the end of this puking sore hellscape was not a prize for me. It felt like I was going to be putting myself through this for something I didn’t even want - motherhood. 
Pregnancy is DANGEROUS. It KILLS people. I don’t want to spend days on end with doctors, in a hospital, possibly get cut open. To then have to dedicate the rest of my life to the screaming, complaining, hardship of actually raising a child? No. 

I’ve seen the way parents talk in this pandemic. I see every time they say this is the hardest thing they’ve ever done. That’s so amazing for them, but it’s not a journey worth it for me. 

I have my at home, medical abortion scheduled for 6 pm today and I couldn’t be more relieved to finally be done with this! I took my first abortion pill yesterday and will be taking the second round this evening. This is literally the most excited I’ve been since the pregnancy started. We’ve already looked into vasectomy and having my tubes tied possibly moving forward. I absolutely never want to have to share my body with a fetus ever again!

Very luckily, my husband also isn’t keen on child rearing so it’s a win win for me!",t2_5nwi7eb9,1630680452,prochoice

Why pro-life is solely focused on legal prohibition of abortions,"I am not convinced that abortion is definitely an ethical choice, still, it is obvious  (for me too) that the right to terminate a pregnancy is significantly important for all women capable of getting pregnant. Otherwise you don’t control your own body and your own reproductive system. 

So, if the right to terminate pregnancy is one of the essential women rights and it is an extremely controversial topic, why won’t pro-life agitate for other ways of decreasing amount of abortions? It is obvious that sex education, easy access to condoms, campaign against any forms of sexual violence, against poverty and etc. These are gonna drastically decrease number of performed abortions annually. Maybe even more than legal prohibition in long term. In the same time, I don’t think many people will see it as an issue and a controversy.

Not coincidentally, pro-life are usually right wing who are also against public healthcare that also often provides free abortion. Isn’t it likely that all this “war” is not even related to ethics but simply to economic and political interests of specific groups?

Serious question for the pro-choice lawyers in TX: is it possible to use the new abortion law against those that created it?,"This is a serious question here, for the actual lawyers in the sub. My understanding is that this law is written so poorly that pretty much anyone, anywhere can file suit against anyone, regardless of how familiar they are with the facts of the case - provided they have a lawyer who can and will file the suit.   
If I'm correct about that, what's to prevent pro-choice supporters from around the country from making fivolous claims against pretty much any of the anti-choice people that have either pushed, passed or allowed this law to come into existance? Sure, it will be laughed out of court if they decide to show up, but if they don't, they're on the hook for the $10k and lawyers fees, right?  
I'm totally serious on this. I'm not a lawyer, let alone one that's allowed to practice in TX, but if what they've done is create a weapon, why not use it against the scumbags that created it and allowed it to stand? Abbot, Alito, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Gorsuch, Thomas and Roberts. Fuck 'em all.  
Why limit it to just the just the politicians? What's to prevent people from suing pretty much anyone: Mitch McConnel, DJT, Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, etc? What about the anti-choice groups who wrote it too?

I'm totally serious here. If what they've done is create a legal weapon, well, the pro-choice side can use it as well, right? I don't have the training, but how hard would it be to file 10K, 100K, or 1M frivolous lawsuits and spam the entire TX civil court system?

Answers to Questions About the Texas Abortion Law. Taken from today's New York Times article,"The law prohibits abortions before many women even know they’re pregnant, and it will be hard to challenge in the courts

A Texas law banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy went into effect on Wednesday, despite the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to the procedure, making the state the most restrictive in the nation in terms of access to abortion services.

Other states have passed similar laws, but those measures face legal challenges. The Texas law is the first to be implemented. On a vote of 5 to 4, the court refused just before midnight on Wednesday to block the law.

Because of the way the law was written,  it may be difficult to challenge in court, representing a sea change in the battle over abortion rights and inviting imitation by other jurisdictions seeking to tamp down access to abortion.

“These laws are unconstitutional, as we have understood Supreme Court rulings until now, and courts have quickly issued preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.

“This is the first one that has gone into effect,” she added. “This is huge in that respect.”

Here are answers to a few common questions about the new legislation.

Is the law a complete ban on abortions?

The law bars abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in the embryo. This typically occurs around the sixth week of pregnancy.

That is very early in a pregnancy, and many women do not know they are pregnant at that point. By the time a pregnant woman misses her period, she is four weeks pregnant, as doctors usually define it.

Under the Texas law, then, a woman would have about two weeks to recognize her condition, confirm the pregnancy with a test, make a decision about how to manage the pregnancy and obtain an abortion.

Many women may not track their periods carefully, may have irregular cycles, or may not know the exact date of the start of their last period, experts noted.

“It is extremely possible and very common for people to get to the six-week mark and not know they are pregnant,” said Dr. Jennifer Villavicencio, lead for equity transformation at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The cardiac activity detected on ultrasound is not a true heartbeat, Dr. Villavicencio added. It results from electrical activity, but the valves of the heart have not yet formed. And the sound does not indicate the pregnancy is viable, she said.

“Forcing them to find out about a pregnancy and make a decision about how to manage it in a short period of time is antithetical to ethical care,” Dr. Villavicencio said.

Does the law make exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, or to protect the life of the mother?

The law does not make exceptions for rape or incest. It does permit abortions for health reasons, but the exceptions are narrowly drawn, allowing a termination only if the pregnancy could endanger the mother’s life or lead to “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,” Ms. Nash noted.

“These are very narrow exceptions,” she said, and the language does not cover every instance in which a woman’s health might be at risk. Nonetheless, she added, “Health providers will be very conservative about interpreting the law, because they don’t want to cross a line.”

Doesn’t Roe v. Wade guarantee a woman’s right to abortion? Can the Texas law be challenged on constitutional grounds?

The Texas law bars state officials from actually enforcing it, a design intended to make it difficult to challenge in the courts.

Usually a lawsuit aiming to block such a law as unconstitutional names state officials as defendants. Instead, the Texas law deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who performs an abortion or “aids and abets” a procedure. Plaintiffs who have no connection to the patient or the clinic may sue and recover legal fees, as well as $10,000 if they win.

Understand the Texas Abortion Law
Card 1 of 4
The most restrictive in the country. The Texas abortion law, known as Senate Bill 8, amounts to a nearly complete ban on abortion in the state. It prohibits most abortions after about six weeks of preganancy and makes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from incest or rape.

Citizens, not the state, will enforce the law. The law effectively deputizes ordinary citizens — including those from outside Texas — allowing them to sue clinics and others who violate the law. It awards them at least $10,000 per illegal abortion if they are successful.

Patients cannot be sued. The law allows doctors, staff and even a patient’s Uber driver to become potential defendants.

The Supreme Court’s silence. The law restricting abortions in Texas went into effect on Wednesday after the Supreme Court did not act on a request to block it, prompting clinics in the state to turn away women seeking the procedure.

As a result, the question for the Supreme Court is not whether the law is constitutional, but whether it can be challenged in court.

Does Texas now have the most restrictive abortion law in the nation?

Other states — including Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio — have also passed “heartbeat” laws that ban abortion once cardiac activity can be detected on an ultrasound scan.

Those laws would also ban abortions at about six weeks of pregnancy, 18 weeks earlier than the legal standard set by Roe v. Wade, which allows abortion up until about 24 weeks, roughly the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb. But those state laws have been held up by legal challenges and have not been implemented.

Abortion providers in Texas estimate that 85 percent of patients seeking abortion are at least six weeks pregnant and would be denied care under the new state law.

Who will be most affected by the Texas law?

There are seven million women of childbearing age in Texas, and the law will make it more difficult for all of them to obtain abortions in the state, as legislators intended.

But the measure will create nearly insurmountable obstacles for certain vulnerable populations, abortion providers said. Among them: teenagers, who often don’t realize they are pregnant until later in a pregnancy; low-income people, who need to find about $550 to cover the cost of the procedure; and people of color, including undocumented immigrants.

About 70 percent of abortions in Texas in 2019 were provided to women of color, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Texas requires minors to obtain permission from a parent or guardian to gain access to abortion care. Some minors must go to court to do so, adding to the delays, said Rosann Mariappuram, executive director of Jane’s Due Process in Austin, Texas, which helps teenagers get abortions.

Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps low-income women pay for abortions, said she was particularly concerned about the new law’s potential impact on Black women in Texas, who already face high maternal mortality rates.

Undocumented women cannot travel easily around the state to get access to care, she added, and women with chronic illnesses can find a pregnancy life-threatening.",t2_n6epl,1630597329,prochoice

Has anyone figured out the scope and grounds for the TX anti-choice law?,"I tried asking this on the ""Explain like I'm 5"" sub-reddit, but evidently, it's too controversial a topic, so I'm hoping that it's ok for me to ask this here.

Anyway, I realize that everyone is upset about this, but at this point, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the scope and legality of this law, largely because I'm trying to figure out how or if it's possible for people to circumvent this ridiculous law.

In terms of bio-data, I'm pro-choice, M49; and just don't understand how this law is legal.

So, on that note, do we know yet what:

1. are the legal ground that this law is based on;
2. is the scope of the law (I list out some of the scenarios below that aren't clear to me)

Anyway, my understanding is that the law allows 3rd parthy individuals - including those outside of Texas - to bring civil lawsuits against abortion providers or anyone else found to ""aid or abet"" illegal abortions (those later than 6 weeks). This includes even a taxi or uber driver who may transport the individual. I'm sure that you all are already familiar with this.

However my understanding is that this is true EVEN IF THE ABORTION IS PERFORMED OUT OF STATE. Is this latter part correct? If so, that seems like a HUGE overstep. Don't misunderstand me - it's a HUGE overstep in either case, but I'm absolutely flabbergasted that any of this is possible.

In terms of the scope of the law, it's fairly clear that the law applies to any Texan that is ""aiding and abetting"" any Texan woman if she gets an abortion in Texas. However, it's not clear to me if it's just limited to that one situation. Specifically:

1. Does the law apply to any Texan that is ""aiding and abetting"" any Texan woman if she gets an abortion outside of Texas? (the most likely scenario)
2. Does the law apply to any non-Texan that is ""aiding and abetting"" any Texan woman if she gets an abortion outside of Texas? (2nd most likely scenario)
3. ~~Does the law apply to any non-Texan that is ""aiding and abetting"" any Texan woman if she gets an abortion inside of Texas?~~ (listed for completeness, but I assume other TX laws would cover this scenario)
4. Does the law apply to any Texan individual that is ""aiding and abetting"" any non-Texan woman if she gets an abortion outside of Texas? (again, not likely, but I'm curious).
5. Does the law apply to any non-Texan individual that is ""aiding and abetting"" any non-Texan woman if she gets an abortion outside of Texas? (I can't possibly see how this is legal, but what if they travel through part of Texas on their way, like through the panhandle).
6. Others that I'm not considering?

Ultimately, I'm trying to figure out A) if there are other legal avenues for challenging this law; and B) also to build support against it from people who might not otherwise care so deeply.  

Specifically, if this law allows individuals to bring suits against people for ""aiding and abetting"" a woman getting an abortion outside of Texas, does that mean that states can pass similar laws for other behaviors that are illegal in them, e.g. marijuana/cannabis use in states where it's legal. If so, I'm quite sure that there are a bunch of young dude-bros out there that would sit up and take notice if that were to happen.

Thanks in advance, and apologies for the flair, if I've chosen the wrong one.",t2_n7qt0,1630593444,prochoice
Am I horrible for still having questions and being undecided?,"I grew up conservative Christian. I’m not conservative anymore I’m in fact very opposite. However I still have some of my own personal convictions that I have. But that’s just me. I believe the government should never force religion on to people. And everyone deserves an equal chance in this country no matter who you are. I myself just personally don’t know where I fall under abortion. I don’t know if I still think it’s murder. And regardless if I think it is or not I don’t think government should have the authority to come in and tell a woman what she can do. Also is there ever a point where certain abortions should be seen a wrong under the law? Basically as you can tell I’m still trying to figure out what I think on the subject. I have friends on the pro life and pro choice side and honestly they are both very pushy. I feel like it’s not allowed anymore to be undecided for a period of time. Or have time to figure it out. I just turned 19 and I’m still forming my world view. I just feel pressure especially politically like I need to know exactly where I stand on every subject. One of my friends will text me all the time and be like “did you see what Sarah said?” Sarah is one of my other friends. And I’ll be like “no what” and she will be like “she mentioned something about being pro life again” and I am just like “ooof” because honestly it’s not my problem what my friend posts that’s hers. 
I feel like if I don’t hate and cast out pro life people than I’m not a true liberal. Like I’m my own person. I wish my one friend didn’t act like I’m responsible for what Sarah decides to believe. If I tell either of them “I don’t know where I stand on the subject right now ” they will just get mad at me. I know this is a bigger issue than my feelings.

Submitted my own message to Texas,"I saw that people across the country were crashing the abortion whistleblower site with troll reports and messages of disgust to the Texas Government. I don’t live in Texas, but their new law enraged me so much that I just had to stand in solidarity with other women. 

This is what I submitted to their tip site:

This law violates the most basic human right- bodily autonomy. The government has no right to make decisions about women’s bodies, not now, not ever. I find it grossly hypocritical that you all are fighting mask and vaccine mandates because it’s “your body, your choice,” but then turn around and tell women that it’s “your body, my choice.” And no exceptions to rape or incest? Are you kidding me? I was raped as a child. If I had ended up pregnant and was forbidden to abort, the people who made those laws would be no better than the rapist, forcing me to use my body for something I did not consent to. And I can guarantee that I would not be here today if I had gotten pregnant and was forced to give birth. 

Notice how this view is called “pro-choice” and not “pro-death.” You can’t make choices for other women. They have feelings and opinions and possibly medical conditions like PCOS that make pregnancy a big risk. On the other side, it seems that the government is not “pro-life” but “pro-birth.” You seriously think it’s better to send thousands of babies into the already crowded and abusive orphanage institutions? 

“But people will use abortion as birth control!” No. Abortions cost upwards of $600 and have a long recovery time. Nobody is going to use it as birth control.

And if you think that this will decrease the number of abortions, you are mistaken. This will only decrease the number of safe abortions. Would you seriously rather the women in Texas die than offer them safe and accessible abortion? You dehumanize and enslave women for your own political agenda, and I cannot say even describe the disgust that causes me.

What if it was your mother, sister, aunt, wife, or daughter that would die unless they aborted the baby? What then? Are you prepared to look your daughter in the eyes and tell her that she’s not allowed to go through with an abortion that would save her life? Are you prepared to be contacted by the police because they found her dead in a hotel room- bleeding and suffering from sepsis beside a coat hanger from an abortion gone wrong? Is that the reality you prefer? Because that’s what will happen.

I am so disgusted. Forcing women to sacrifice her body unwillingly for nine months regardless of the danger to herself is slavery. It’s wrong.

Reminder that abortion bans don't work &amp; hurt women,"Pro-lifers still refuse to learn from past history that abortion bans;

1. Do not work.

Women just go out of state and have an abortion anyway.
Or will source abortion pills online or in person.
The poll I did here shows about 95% of abortion minded women in this section would try to get an abortion even if it was illegal.

2. Hurt &amp; kill women.

If women can't access safe means to abortion they will use unsafe means like DIY instrumental abortion or trying different herbal concoctions.

Abortion occurred in 23 (out of 86) cases after the ingestion of parsley, ruda, Carachipita, celery, Cedron, francisco alvarez, floripon, espina colorada. 
Multiple organ system failure occurred in those patients who had ingested ruda (alone or in combination with parsley or fennel), Carachipita, arnica, or bardana. Deaths occurred in one case of Carachipita ingestion and in 4 cases of ruda ingestion (2 cases of ruda alone, 2 cases of ruda with parsley and fennel). Self-inflicted instrumental manipulations were found in 4 of the patients with multiple organ system failure and in one of those who died.

"Every Texan male/amab should be afraid of TX SB8 - and you know what, every prolifer should be afraid of this law too","Someone asked a question on another post: Can men also be held liable for having sex with women that they know will get abortions? 

Technically, they would have contributed to the abortion as well. Technically, *any* male would have, whether they knew or not if the person would have an abortion. If an abortion occurred, it could not have occurred if not for their insemination. And the law makes no exception for if you had knowledge of aiding an abortion or not.

I don't know that the bill stipulates that the aiding and abetting of the abortion has to occur post conception.

And since the point of the bill is to tie up people in court and deplete their financial resources, it doesn't actually matter if the claim is credible or not. It's just meant to instill fear; it's a form of domestic terrorism really.

Would be a real shame if someone started a fund dedicated to suing known prolifers and their family members in Texas. *Again, you don't actually need to win*; **that isn't the point of the law.**

If they want to use this tactic, use their own tactics right back at them. They created this legal weapon but there is no reason we can't wield it as well.

"""abortion bounties"" - who pays the 10k?","Something I am not understanding about the new Texas law...

Figured I would ask here.

Where does the 10k come for individual busybodies or pro-life organizations come from?

- Is it from a state entity if someone gets a win? 

- Is it from a civil judgement versus the person getting, aiding in, or doing the abortion? And, if that's the case, what if the person cant pay? Does this make them judgement proof or does Texas throw in jail if you cant pay?

- Are there limitations? Can you get sued multiple times by multiple people for the same abortion?

- Does this still work out-of-state? Say, a Texas resident rides up to a place in Colorado. Some person up there takes license plates and pics of anyone from Texas in the parking lot. Then, when they get back to Dallas, Brownsville, Austin,  wherever get a court date at some hole in the wall county?

How can I convince a friend of mine to become pro-choice?,"Since SB8 is in effect and people are losing their rights to abortion in Texas -- even rape victims -- I believe it is more important than ever for people to talk to people about abortion. People have not become more pro-choice since Roe v. Wade, and I believe that pro-choice people need to start having the conversation with others about why abortion isn't wrong. Not about how republicans ""only care about babies when they're in the womb"", or how anti-abortion is bad in the worst of cases. We need to instead be talking about how abortion is acceptable in any case, because women deserve bodily autonomy just as much as men. Because if we can accept abortion in all cases, then pregnant people in the worst of cases will be less afraid to get an abortion if they need one. I oftentimes lurk on this subreddit, but I never argue with people or start conversations with people who are anti-abortion. I believe that I need to be the person to talk to my friend about this, but what if I mess up? I don't want to mess this up and make them more pro-life.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend believes that abortion is murder, and that there is no reason to have an abortion, even if it is in cases of rape. Conversely, they do not want any children and want to get sterilized some day. Abortion is their strongest political belief, but besides that they are generally republican. I've noticed that they want doctors to stop denying women sterilization procedures, and they believe that womens' access to sterilization will reduce abortion rates. I believe that they genuinely believe that their belief is about saving babies and not hurting women. I'm thinking that I need to use the car analogy for body autonomy (I never knew about the car analogy for the longest time and nobody talks about it, so my guess is that not many people talk about the car analogy), but I bet that fetal pain concerns them a lot too.

Strategy to fight against Texas Heartbeat Bill,"OK, first of all - IANAL. However, I came across this article about the Texas bill - and this part struck me as interesting:  


&gt; S.B. 8 authorizes “any person” *other than* the *government* to sue someone who provides an abortion after six weeks, helps someone obtain an abortion after six weeks or “intends” to do these things.   
...  
For instance, S.B. 8 allows suits to be brought in any of Texas’s 254 counties and bars the courts from transferring the case to a more appropriate location. A physician who provides abortions in El Paso, for example, might have to fly across the state to Houston to defend themselves against an ideologue or stranger looking to force them to stop. If the vigilante prevails, they get their costs and attorney’s fees covered — but if abortion providers and assisters successfully defend themselves, they have to swallow all of their litigation costs. The law also allows abortion providers to be sued multiple times over a single abortion, while prohibiting them from defending on the ground that another court already found in their favor 

So... suppose pro-choice groups were to go ahead, under this law, and start up the lawsuits. Say, against certain governors, lawmakers, other public pro-choice figures, alleging they intend to help someone provide an abortion. It sounds to me that, even if they cannot \*prove\* that these allegations are true, the accused still is going to have to pay court costs to defend themselves. And, you can keep suing in every single Texas county for the same alleged offense.

Texas Law Activism and Links,"The mod team is deeply saddened that the Texas law SB 8 is now in place in Texas, it bans abortion after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape victims or those carrying a fetus that is incompatible with life.

We have reached out to the activist Robin Marty as to how this sub can help Texas women

The biggest help is to get people out of Texas and to neighboring states. The Texas abortion funds are working hard on that and there is currently an act blue link that lets people give money to all of them at once. - https://secure.actblue.com/donate/texasabortionfundshttps://secure.actblue.com/donate/texasabortionfunds

For Texas residents they should be calling (emails don't work) their reps. A LOT, Letting them know their views on SB8.

For people who are in a state that borders Texas, they should contact their own local fund to ask how they can help, since the border states are going to end up with a surge.

One big problem at the moment is Louisiana was expected to take in a lot of east Texas and now the state is sort of toast because of infrastructure from the hurricanes. And the waits for those clinics were already two weeks. So that's rippling out to MS, which also has at least a week's wait, and overflow of people who can't get in there are already flowing to AL. The whole gulf coast is already a mess and about to get a lot worse

I'm (f18) pregnant and I'm completely unable to get an abortion. (PLEASE direct me to the right subreddit if this isn't the right place to ask these kinds of questions or talk about this kind of thing..well..y'know),"Hi, I f18 took a pregnancy test just a week ago and found out that I am in fact pregnant after having every period symptom without any bleeding. This was confirmed by a drs visit. I'm about 3½-4½ weeks along. I was taking birth control to no avail. 

I am pro choice and feel people should choose what is right for them, and for me, it is abortion. I can't have a child under the circumstances that I'm in. 

I deal with a lot of mental issues, some diagnosed and definitely some undiagnosed and they are not treated at all, I don't even go to therapy, I am completely financially unstable and due to a criminal record, I can not get a job (I have not been imprisoned, just a dumb kid making poor choices :/), and overall, I am just not ready to take care of a kid, especially when not only am I ALSO a kid, but because I can barely take care of myself. 

My boyfriend, his family, and my family know, and everyone seems very unphased except for us, which is becoming a serious problem. My mom is NOT pro choice.  She knows that I am unwilling to follow through, even breaking down isn't enough to get her to see that I am not okay with being pregnant. When I told her, she couldn't talk to me for almost two days. She says there's no way she can support it, so the choices I had are irrelevant, and I actually don't have a choice at all. Abortion in my state (RI) at PP costs $550, money that I don't have and will not be able to acquire. 

I am so lost and feel absolutely out of control with my own body. Not to mention the fact that I am teeny tiny. I am 5'0"", underweight, thin, and relatively unhealthy (smoking, unable to keep down food)
I feel as if there's no way I'll actually be able to go through with a pregnancy. I have never wanted kids due to the fright of what could happen to me during birth. 

What can I do? This whole thing is spiraling out of my control and I can't handle this for months on end. I'm terrified and anxious, and worried, and there's nothing I can do to help myself. I have no friends and no other family I can turn to. I am almost completely alone in this.",t2_9dwd87en,1630451445,prochoice

"abortion number 11, i think my husband is getting me pregnant on purpose","hi, i’m 26 and i’ve been married for 7 years. in this time (and before) me and him have only used condoms as hormonal birth control has never been an option for me and ive chickened out of getting an iud fitted. it was working well until about
3 years ago (by working well i mean we only had one mistake, but that was due to a time without using a condom at 17) 

in may when i was 23, i fell pregnant again, bearing in mind we’d always agreed on being child free so it was an easy decision for us to have abortion no. 2
assuming it was just a unnoticed condom break or something of that sort i carried on as normal but in august, you guessed it, pregnant again. same outcome. 

at this point we were both concerned, i attempted to get the iud fitted again but it caused me so much pain and bleeding i had to get it out within 2 months. instead i thought to try a different brand of condom. 

all was well until january of the next year. pregnant. abortion. the cycle continues for 6 more times until last year i asked him to get a vasectomy, he flat out refused no way he’d get one he said. he even mentioned something along the lines of “wanting me to have his baby inside me, even if it was only shortly” which really concerned me, i don’t know if i’m overreacting but that made me question whether these pregnancies were actually accidental. i know the failure rate of condoms isn’t that high but i have been told by my ob that she thought i could be “over fertile” something about releasing both eggs.

well i just wanted to get everyone’s views on this, it’s very embarrassing for me to share hence the account as i know i have had an unacceptable amount of terminations. but i just need some advice and help, it’s really taking a toll on my mental (and i assume physical) health now but i don’t know what to do :( since asking him for a vasectomy i had one abortion and i’m worried i’m pregnant again.",t2_dvrflebf,1630369715,prochoice
It would be funny to spam that anti abortion website with this copypasta,"“I used to work at an abortion clinic and I saw some extremely fucked up shit there which is why I'm so anti-abortion now. This is just SOME of the horrible stuff I personally witnessed:

• ⁠A 23 year old woman came in 11 months into her pregnancy and said ""I don't want my stupid baby anymore, kill it"" and the doctor said ""okay"" and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight

• ⁠A little 8-year old girl wandered in and said ""I want an abortion but I am not pregnant"" and the doctor said ""we'll fix that"" and he stole a baby and cut the girl open and put the baby inside her and sewed her shut and then woke the girl up and said ""congratulations it's a healthy six year old boy"" and the girl said ""can I keep him"" and the doctor said no and then backed over her in the parking lot with his brand new Ford Raptor

• ⁠They made me sign an agreement promising to stop drinking from the medical waste container (I signed somebody else's name)

• ⁠One of the doctors there developed a futuristic ray gun that could make anything he shot have an abortion, even trees, cars, or barns

• ⁠The receptionist threw nail polish at an elderly man

• ⁠The doctor's assistant invented this thing she called ""the silly slide"" and it was a really fun little water slide that connected a woman's vagina to a paper shredder so a newborn baby could briefly ""enjoy the high life""

• ⁠The oldest child we aborted was in his late 70s, we didn't even know he was a baby until his wife brought in photos

• ⁠The doctors put all sorts of crap up a woman's uterus including a clown nose, bicycle handlebars, a calendar, and an entire Sears retail outlet (before bankruptcy)

• ⁠During every successful abortion, the doctor would shout ""take that, baby"" and he'd push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we'd all get Del Taco for free”",t2_3pblbz30,1630366149,prochoice

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"# Please provide sources for vaccine related information. If a source is not readily provided, you are encouraged to ask that person for their source.

For the most up-to-date information on the vaccine, please visit the [CDC's Covid19 vaccination webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/index.html) or the [World Health Organization's webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1630310423,prochoice

"Countering the ""pregnancy is ordinary means of care"" argument","Pro-lifers commonly make the argument that gestation is an ordinary means of care and compare it to feeding, clothing &amp; taking care of a new born/child.

They use this as an argument to try and ignore the fact they are trying to force violation of the woman's body.

It is a strawman logical fallacy.
That deliberately ignores and distorts the true facts.

1. There is nothing ordinary about providing ""care"" that risks your life and health.
2. No parent is ever obligated to risk their life or health for their child to provide care.
3. No parents are obligated to donate blood, use of organs or their body to their child.

They basically are just arguing based on their feelings that they think the fetus IS entitled to it, ie entitled to special rights (special pleading).

Special pleading is an informal fallacy wherein one cites something as an exception to a general or universal principle, without justifying the special exception. It is the application of a double standard.",t2_5vlvig8t,1630149614,prochoice

If you have knowledge that someone donates to TRL, you can now sue them for aiding and abetting if they were not also outside the abortion clinics. 

The pregnant person that they sued? She feared for her financial health and thus had to have an abortion to pay her attorney fees. She couldn’t afford to have her baby. TRL aided an abortion and now can be sued under their own law. 

Makes about as much sense as their dumb bullshit law. 

This law is ridiculous. And honestly is a form of terrorism - striking fear into providers and citizens alike to try to make them fear for their own safety by helping a pregnant person. 

It also violates freedom of speech - something Republicans are so vehemently against. 

It violates the right to privacy - how are you going to prove a person even *had* an abortion without violating their privacy? Which would be necessary to win a case.

More Irony,"Pro-""lifers"" will say things like life begins at conception, but also, in the face of a baby that will die soon after birth, they will tell the parent not to abort on grounds of ""they deserve to live, even if it's only for a few minutes"" like what?

a) Any person who is about to naturally die in a few minutes is in extreme suffering, let us not pretend. You want that baby to be in pain? smh. Why not allow an abortion where it's not fully developed and isn't going to suffer as much.

b) but y'all believe life begins at conception, did the fetus not already have its chance? sheesh

c) you want the mother to go through the extreme trauma of the whole pregnancy, labour, childbirth and seeing a baby that looks like it could live, but instead it's excessively crying, or even worse, not crying at all and dying painfully? fuck anyone who wants to force someone to go through that.

but i already know the answer. pro-""lifers"" don't really care about AFAB or babies; if they did, they'd do some research into how harmful banning abortion is to these two groups. it's entirely about controlling AFAB and nothing else",t2_aj15yflh,1629883642,prochoice

Nervous with bans,Hey guys just need to vent. I’m in the United States and many strict abortion bans are being passed and now Roe v Wade that protects abortion is being challenged by a majority conservative court. Most of the states would ban abortion and Texas already has bounty hunting after six weeks. I live thankfully in the least restricted state or one of them at least but I’m still nervous because what if then a anti choicer in the future becomes governor? I know I’m overthinking but I struggle with my mental health and not long ago got on lamictal for my depression. I feel amazing but my anxiety is still like it always is just easier to fight. I have generalized anxiety disorder. My lamictal can interact badly with birth control some say it’s the lamictal that get more affected but whatever. I’m too scared to get an IUD or that implant. Like I said I’m on a few meds and idk how much it’s lessening my bc if it is. I never want to go through pregnancy. I have tokophobia for one and know I could never raise a child from a newborn. And I know it would destroy my mental health and I would get ppd so bad. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before and I know that would bring them back. People say there is help for it but I don’t even want to take the chance. Pregnancy and small kids freak me out. I don’t think I could survive being forced to carry a pregnancy and have my body destroyed or risk the crazy stuff that can happen with it or even die. And I know this my sound selfish or ridiculous but I know people would care more about the baby and not me. With all this I just want to be sterilized. Idc if I’m only 20. I may to too young in many peoples eyes but I do not care. I know I would still try to abort if bans were in place and we all know how bad that is. The underground abortion pill organization gives me some hope. Sorry if this sounds silly but it’s been on my mind. In my state I can’t get sterilized till I’m 21 and everyone talks about how hard it is to get a doctor to do it for women.,t2_5jvnyuc7,1629777993,prochoice

When prolifers say they believe in a rape exception which ""type"" do they mean?

There's the ""worst"" type of rape where your life could be in danger and it usually leaves you traumatized but there's also the type of rape where for example you have a drink too much to the point where you can't consent and have sex with your husband anyways. Although this likely won't cause you any trauma and you probably won't report them for rape it's still rape because you didn't consent.

I know this might be an immature stance, but I am sick of having to debate with people who refuse to acknowledge that maybe people with uteruses should be allowed to make decisions about things that happen to their bodies. On top of that, if they’re pro-LIFE shouldn’t that policy extend to all forms of life? So naturally I assume that they’re pro-gun control, vegan etc. I’m also struggling to understand their refusal to see that consent to sex does not equate to consent to pregnancy, hence most of the reason why condoms and birth control exist? Not to mention that pregnancy isn’t solely caused by consensual sex and can be caused by r*pe. Building on that, I have seen on the pro-life reddit that they are still against abortion even if the woman has been r*ped. So, compiled with the trauma of what the man did to her, she now has to go through an entire pregnancy to carry this r*pist’s baby.

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.",t2_6l4z3,1629705616,prochoice

Please let me know if I'm simply overthinking things. (Forgive the length),"TLDR; is the anti-vaxxers claiming ""my body my choice"" going to negatively impact pro-choice arguments in the future? 

I (37M, USA) would like to consider myself an ally. I firmly believe in a woman's right to choose. That being said, I worry about anti-vaxxers claiming the ""my body, my choice"" mantra that I've seen all over the pro-choice communities. 

The worry stems from this argument, being weaponized in such a way by the anti-vaxxers is the reason so many people are getting sick, or dying from this preventable disease. I fully agree with the *sentiment*, as one does have agency over their medical decisions, but the practice of it is horrific. The claim of their bodily autonomy is literally killing others by the thousands in the US. 

My concern is that once COVID has passed, the usage of ""My body, my choice"" is going to be negated by these same people as their attempts to utilize the phrase has been met with catastrophic failure and death. The mantra will be argued against because of how COVID played out; an individual's choice must be overridden for the 'good' of society as a whole. 

The mental gymnastics involved are quite intense, but I cant seem to shake this feeling that it will be used against pro-choice decisions in courts. Its just one avenue that they could use on top of everything else they are already doing.

When they say ""then just don't have sex"" we all know they only mean women having sex w their fling, bf, one night stands, etc. But they NEVER say that to men. So I want to know what would a pro-lifer say to a long time married couple who doesn't want children and practice safe, consensual sex with only each other. They take every precaution they can, the man is even fixed, (but the woman isnt because doctora refuse to do the surgery on women without kids ugh) and somehow she gets pregnant through the small small chance that the vasectomy and birth control fails and the condom didnt even break but they still get pregnant.

Treating their or other's kids like dolls, denying them the right to educate themselves, forcing religion on them, denying them the right to seek healthcare for things they don't deem ""necessary,"" etc. It's like fetuses are ever-so-human and on occasion babies too but the moment these people gain a conscience and become children, they aren't human anymore. It should be the other way around. Children are human and deserve a right to self-determination, they are just smaller and less experienced humans who need help doing that and need guidance. They are not dolls, or housework slaves, or anything of the sort. And I'm tired of seeing these anti-choicers call literal clumps of cells human while denying the poor kids their humanity.

Comparing an early stage embryo to a baby is idiotic.,"In my opinion, early abortions are morally acceptable, since the embryo in it's early stages has no feelings, emotions or will to live.

""But you're taking away it's potential chance to become a baby/to exist"" - same can be said about masturbation, menstruating or simply not reproducing to begin with. Does that mean anyone should feel responsible for all the potential babies they didn't make? 

.
""If your parents made an abortion, you wouldn't exist""- Yes, and I wouldn't mind not existing, because I wouldn't exist enough to care. Yet some people always feel obligated to bring up that stupid argument thinking they're so smart or edgy for saying that.

An abortion love letter to my mother TW: sexual abuse,"This is a love letter to my mum, a strong, wonderful woman and an unexpected pro choice queen. 

I was 16 when I found out I was pregnant, I was jobless, I dropped out of college and I was isolated and controlled by an abusive older man who raped me and coerced me into having sex with him. I felt violated that my body was being used by his fetus. I was extremely sick, I lost a lot of weight and I felt ashamed. Ashamed because 10 years ago I didn’t know anyone that had had an abortion. I didn’t hear anyone speak about it, abortion was a taboo that I soon realised shouldn’t be a taboo. I trawled forums for advice and came across a lot of pro life nonsense. It was a moment of absolute certainty that I didn’t want to be pregnant. 

My mother, a woman that knows the hideous and unpleasantness of pregnancy and still gave birth to my siblings and I, has never had an abortion, is a “traditional mother” but she never judged my decision and didn’t try to convince me otherwise. She was calm unlike myself. I don’t think I would’ve been able to go to the abortion clinic on my own. My mum was there at my medical abortion appointments, she held my hand, stroked my back, told me that everything was going to be ok. Our relationship wasn’t perfect but when I needed her the most, she was there. I had a successful abortion and I ended the relationship with my abuser, I started back at college and my life went uphill from there.  

It has been what feels like a long time since then, I have rewired my brain to see my abortion as a positive experience. I don’t feel shame, I am extremely pro choice and I believe abortion should be free and accessible to everyone. Every person that can get pregnant deserves the choice. I knew what I wanted and I did it. I knew what I didn’t want and I made a decision. I am so proud of my 16 year old self, I wish I could cuddle her and give her a peek into her bright and happy future.",t2_6d4u470k,1629411238,prochoice

I hate when I talk to someone about abortions and they try to use the fact that a fetus is a human as a valid reason to why we shouldn't have abortion,"OK lets make one thing clear I don't see fetus as human not until they re fully developed anyway so around the 24-26 week mark is the soonest i'll be willing to recognized them as human being. However that is beside the point. 

a lot of people who oppose abortion would like to throw around the argument that it's a human and we should respect all human or something close to it. Whenever I hear that my first reaction is just to ask them, and why should I care that it's a human? 

Now before I go any further let me say that the reason Why I feel and think this way is because I live in America, so if your not from america then you can just ignore this post since you may not be able to relate cause of how the country is run and stuff.  

Now I know a lot of people both pro choice and pro life party may not agree with me and that's fine we can all have our own opinion but from my point of view the way I see it most human would totally kill another if it mean their own survival. Not even kill but really mistreat other human being.  I am not sure if you know it but Human are kinda terrible. Let's look at what happened the since the whole pandemic happened. We had the whole mess with the police and BLM, We had the January 6 Attack, We have the fact that people not only refuse to protect themselves against covid but also are willing putting the people around them in danger. The fact that one party was willing to let people die for profit, We have the fact during the election people was treating voters or trying to intimidate them. The fact that we have people that can call for the death of another for apparently violating our freedom. Those are what I can think of that happened since Covid.

Since america had been around . We had slavery, the Japanese interment, camp, segregation, The problem with the army, Police brutality, Problem with gun, The whole border problem all these are  example of how much people don't care about one another,  I almost forgot the civil war we had. All of this is from my own country. I could go into the law or exception we have where we legalized the killing of another person but I think I made my point.

After everything I mention do you really expect me to care if a fetus is a human. is that alone supposed to be enough justification to why a women can't have an abortion? Some people who are Pro choice or Pro abort will admit that they think abortion is evil but it's a necessary evil! Me personally at this point I heard so many argument from both side that I really don't know if abortion is evil or not and honestly I don't know If I see a fetus as a human prior to it being fully developed. If all it take to be consider human is have human DNA and that it and if abortion is a evil then I am stilling willing to have it around. 

My reason is being It's the least we can do for the way we treat women. At one point in our country a women was unable to vote, unable to get a job, unable to fight for her country, They was expected to be good mother and wifes at one point and if I am remembering correctly not only in some part in the world a women had no say in who she marry or loved but I think as soon as she started her period she was married off to some old dude. After all the crap we put them through out the centuries it's only fair that they get to decide now what they can do with their body.  I am a men and from what I seen, it seem even though more and more women are fighting back,  if I was a ceo or in any position of power I could do something like sexual harass my female coworker and get away with it cause most female will be too afraid to even speak out cause they might feel scared about challenging such a power figure and what might be even worse then that is the fact that there are some people that would still defend that type of action. saying it's just how guys are or maybe she shouldn't be wearing a dress that is sexual or something to that affect. 

Then those same men are the one that want to stop a women for having an abortion cause they don't like it. I know you can't really compare the issues of sexual harassment to abortion but from my point of view it's complete bull how much power men try to have over women. It's hard enough for most women to get an abortion the last thing she need is a bunch of people drunk off their own morals and self righteousness to make her feel bad about getting one in the first place.

I'm pro choice, I've always been, and that led me to believe getting an abortion would be easy to deal with. I wanted this pregnancy, I realize now, and everything was going well until all I could hear was people telling me that I would regret having a baby. So I did it, went to all the visits, got my appointment, dutifully took the abortion pills. Along the way I forgot it was my decision, I thought that the fact that everyone seemed to agreed that I would get an abortion was the pure truth. The truth? I wanted this baby and now I feel angry at myself for not speaking up earlier. I saw it going down the toilet, it was tiny. I wanted to have this baby and keep studying but no all you hear is horror stories about young mums. I loved that tiny embryo with all my heart and now all I can feel is resentment and the realization that if only I took my time it would have been very different. Being pro choice means making your own choice so please do not be afraid of speaking up about what you really want or you will regret it later, whatever that decision is. I have no idea of how I will get over this or if I ever will be able to so if anything can be learned from this is that is your choice, never forget that.",t2_2pzt1p4f,1629395545,prochoice

Abortion and Covid?,"The future of abortion and contraception isn’t clear. Perhaps someday you’ll lose your right to abortion and even to contraception. Perhaps not. But one thing is clear: while particular forms of population control (i.e., abortion and contraception) are at risk, the future of population control itself is not.

The earth’s population will be controlled, one way or the other. There will be population control, the only question is: what type? Post-birth or pre-birth?

Post-birth methods of population control are starvation, disease, and war. When a country can no longer support its growing population, some people starve or, weakened by malnutrition, die of disease.

He even linked his post from the abortion debate subreddit to prove his point, but I thought all the responses from PC’ers were pretty reasonable and logical. He kept asking them to justify/explain their responses while refusing to do so when he was asked the same thing. He’d also say things like “that’s just your opinion so I’m dismissing it.”

Weekly Vaccine/Mask Megathread,"This is the weekly thread for all vaccine and mask related questions and discussions. 

All discussions relating to this topic need to be contained to this post here. The reason for this is because neither are related to reproductive rights, which is the main theme of the sub. Vaccines do, however pertain to bodily autonomy, and masks tie into that theme. So we wanted to ensure there was a space to talk about them.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made.

# Fast points 

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They are not comparable to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

# What is to be contained to the megathread

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link for reference back to the original comment chain. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

# What's allowed outside the megathread

And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.

Honest question,"Why do you think prolifers are so obsessed with BLACK babies? 

They love to tell us to stop killing our BLACK babies but never to stop killing our babies of other races. If the baby that was aborted was any other race they wouldn't be fine with it so why does the race matter so much?

They like to compare this to slavery but here's the thing, ""slaves"" aren't slaves. They are people who were enslaved, their rights were taken from them. A fetus never had any right to her body. She had rights to her body and by removing them while she's pregnant you're the one enslaving her. Abortion bans make this apply to all pregnant women whether they wanted to be pregnant or not. The fetus does not own me.

I don't see how you can possibly see the fetus as the slave in this situation. Whenever I go on the prolife sub all im seeing lately is ""slave this"" ""black baby that""

# Several updates to the sub

* New rule added: **No ""paper abortion"" type posts**:
   * Abortion is a medical procedure. Child support is a parental rights issue. Conflating the two is insulting to bodily rights. Likewise, rights for the non-pregnant partner to stop or force an abortion do not coincide with bodily rights. And ""having a say"" is a relationship issue. Neither topics will be tolerated here.
* New rule added: **Gender Inclusive**:
   * Please be mindful of the presence of all genders on this sub, whether cis, trans, non-binary, etc. We are here to advocate for the abortion rights of all people with a uterus &amp; as such disrespect towards a person's gender identity will not be tolerated.
* Language of rule 3, ""Screenshots, direct links, &amp; brigading"" has been updated again
* Rule for ""Prochoice Only"" flair has been combined with rule 2.
* New [wiki entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/wiki/fetal_pain) on fetal pain, which has also been added to the sidebar
* New [wiki entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/wiki/legal_understanding_lethal_force) of a legal analysis on the use of lethal force &amp; how it relates to abortion, which has also been added to the sidebar

# New Mod!

We would like to welcome on u/InsomniacEnglish as our newest mod! Welcome, Insomniac! We are excited to have you helping us. :)

# Flairs

Flairs are still a work in progress and have come a long way since we first introduced them about a year ago! They are mostly trial and error to see how they function. Most of the flairs we have have been working for us.

Upon doing an audit, however, we found there are 3 flairs that have some overlaps in their functions:

""Discussion"", ""Prochoice Response"", ""Prochoice Question""

Both the first and last one listed there could both fit within ""Prochoice Response,"" save for a few outliers. Most of the posts that use that flair are a mix of questions and presented arguments that fellow prochoicers want to share. The ""prochoice question"" flair is redundant at this point. And if someone where to come on the sub and attempt to filter posts by this flair, they would actually be missing out on the posts that used ""Prochoice Response"" that are directly presented arguments by fellow sub members, and thus, may satisfy the question they might have.

So we have done away with the ""Prochoice Question"" flair.

The ""Discussion"" flair is a bit more broad in scope compared to the narrower scope of ""Prochoice Response."" So for now, we are leaving the ""Discussion"" flair, but we may combine it with the ""Prochoice Response"" flair at a later point in time.

# Vaccine/Masks Megathread

Posts pertaining to vaccines &amp; masks are getting out of hand. While vaccines can and do relate to the issue of bodily autonomy, masks do not. And neither relate to reproductive rights.

While we understand there are arguments to be made for masks violating bodily autonomy, we believe it is a disingenuous argument to be made:

* They typically do not harm your body, while pregnancy does
* Your body gains a benefit from them as well, not just others, as is not the case with abortion bans
* They do not relate to someone being inside of your body
* If there is harm that can be done to you, either through vaccines or masks, you are typically allowed medical exemptions/alternative options - it is at the time of harm to ones own self that you are no longer required to protect others. Again, this does not happen with abortion bans - quite the opposite where you are expected to endure the harm short of death.

All in all, vaccines and masks are not comparable to the violation that occurs to a pregnant person's body through abortion bans. There are, however, some bodily autonomy overlaps that are worth discussing, especially in a time where people have made this into a political affiliation issue. So we recognize the need for this discussion.

We have decided to create a weekly megathread for these types of topics which will be up and running live starting tomorrow. This will help keep the clutter down on the main sub floor and also act as a reference base for newcomers wishing to discuss this topic further.

Any discussions that are had that are not contained to the megathread will be removed and the poster will be directed to the megathread.

This applies to posts and comments. Meme posts are exempt.

So, what is to be contained to the megathread:

* New **text** posts opening up **discussions** or **debates** about bodily autonomy and how it relates to vaccines &amp; masks.
* Comments attempting to **argue** the position that vaccines or masks violate bodily autonomy, even ones that naturally moved in that direction. If you wish to **debate** the topic at hand, **you need to either DM your interlocuter or you need to make a comment in the megathread**. That comment can include a link back to the original comment chain for reference. Username callouts are an option for you to use if you wish to continue that conversation in the megathread in lieu of a DM. We just do not want **debating** over this to be happening on the sub floor outside the megathread.

What's allowed outside the megathread:

* As reddit makes it difficult to share pictures within comments, **meme** posts criticizing hypocrisy between the prolife movement and ideas such as anti vaccines and anti masks will be allowed. And subsequent comments that are not of a debate nature. (Again, you may copy and paste the link to the post into the megathread to make it clear you wish to debate a point from that particular post.)
* **Posts** that are about another topic and naturally include vaccines and masks as it relates to the main topic - it just cannot be the main topic of the thread.
* Comments sans debating that naturally move towards the idea of vaccines or masks due to overlaps. Ie calling out hypocrisy outside the prochoice movement is okay, debates need to go to the megathread.

These may change at any time, so please check the mega thread for the most recent guidelines if you are unsure.

# Update &amp; transparency on the inclusion of prolife participants on the sub

Us mods recently conducted a poll to determine if members of this sub like seeing prolifers on the sub in which they can engage with.

We conducted a similar poll about a year ago.

The results were about the same as they were then: **about 2/3rds of the sub overwhelming opted for no.**

Us mods have frequently allowed prolifers to attempt engagement with us and we will continue to do so. However, the consensus among us mods is that we are not a soapbox for prolife preaching. We get many trolls who ruin it for others, and those seeking genuine discussion inevitably devolve into preaching to us and trolling us.

This became more evident upon a recent incident involving our sub. I had a recent conversation with a prolife mod about our tactics and I offered complete transparency. We had a good discussion about moderating and he made many good points in which I agreed with. A week later, that same mod, posted about how he used an alt account to troll our sub using a source he knowingly knew was false and tricked us by presenting himself as a fellow prochoicer. He then posted screenshots to his sub.

He made note of his reasons for doing this in order to shed light on his actions as a noble teaching cause. However, this was done within a comment, which was not seen by all (myself included until it was pointed out to me) and as evidenced by the upvotes of the comment vs the post itself. Regardless of a noble motive or not, the fact still remains that it was an unethical tactic for anyone to do, let alone a mod.

It has been the position of this sub to not troll the prolife sub. Do not break their rules and do not brag about it here. Same goes for bans. And it is easy to understand why: *we wouldn't want it done to our own sub, so we don't do it to others.* If you can understand what it would feel like for it to be done to us, then you can understand what that would feel like for them.

While the mods felt that maintaining status quo was best unless otherwise indicated from results of the poll, this event only further provided proof for why the status quo is as it is. If a mod conducts himself in a manner of posting things that one would actually expect a mod to *remove,* there is not much higher conduct we can expect from average users.

That being said, *our* sub does not appear to be the best platform for engagement between prochoicer and prolifer. Ultimately, we think debate is better left to the debate sub.

*My* personal concern at this time is with arming prochoicers with knowledge to assist them in debating this topic offline, which *can* be achieved through direct interaction with the prolife side. There is value in engaging with prolifers and the debate sub has prepared many a prochoicer and helped to strengthen their arguments - seeing other prochoicers in action and presenting their arguments has helped others thusly improve their own. But not enough people are seeing some of the brilliant debates that have taken place, and continue to take place, within that sub.

There is valuable knowledge and political playing field preparation that is pulled from debates. This sub may or may not be the right orientation for that knowledge base. Or at least, not in a manner that involves prolifers directly themselves.

And so I am personally left conflicted on how to best utilize this sub in arming our users with arguments for the prochoice cause as well as refutations to the prolife ones. The wiki entry mentioned above on the legal analysis of lethal force, would be a particularly good way to deliver this valuable knowledge. However, *I* cannot do this all myself, nor should I be - it needs to be a collective effort as this is everyone's cause and sub - which leads into the next segment.

# Wiki Contributors

As part of our effort to harness the power of this platform and provide more tools for engaging on the political battleground, we are asking for wiki contributors who can help us in writing argument wiki entries. Shorter entries to be grouped together in a collection as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/wiki/index/prochoice-arguments) and longer and more important entries given their own dedicated page (and possibly then shared as a post on the sub floor.)

We are looking for someone(s) who we may add as a ""mod"" with wiki permissions only, however if you have a one off contribution, we would welcome that as well. 

If you took a look at the legal analysis wiki page above, this is a great example of one such potential wiki entry. I did not write the argument - I came across the argument on the debate sub, asked permission from the original commenter, credited them, and formatted the page to read smoothly. You could even add your own commentary as well.

**People who are debaters on** r/Abortiondebate **or frequent that sub are of particular interest to this effort** \- I have seen phenomenal arguments made by many of the frequent users there and would personally like to see their arguments preserved in a more permanent manner and stretched to further lengths. Whether this be from you as the debater personally, or you as someone who browses that sub (or elsewhere) and finds entries worthy of being preserved.

We are also open to suggestions on other ways to utilize the wiki, including formatting.

Please msg the mods if you are interested in helping build the wiki.

# Harnessing the power potential from this platform

As stated above, there is a lot of power with this platform. This has been on the minds of us mods for a couple of months now.

I personally suggest building our wiki to be a resource for other fellow prochoicers. 

We also utilized a sticky and the banner last month by asking for donations to the Arkansas Abortion Support Network, which actually worked! (If you have banner making skills and would be willing to assist with future banner endeavors so that we do not have to use r/BannerRequest as our go-to, that would be most helpful.)

We would like to hear suggestions from you though. 

**How might we all as a sub best harness this platform to enact actual change on the political sphere?**

I would of course never tell this to any of the pregnant people I have known in my life, to which I have given the utmost respect.

So when someone treats a fetus this way, it feels like it is undermining the belief that I would like people to hold on the issue.

When I enter to this sub, I can see under the text of the subreddit the following text:

Just by looking at this, we can already see a discrimination for other non-human species. It kinda seems that we should only preserve the reproductive rights of humans.

But, isn't that kind of hypocrite? 

I will make a question: Is it okay to force a dog or a cat or a chimpanzee to get pregnant when they don't want? 

I ask because animals in our current food system are forcibly impregnated by humans whithout having NO choice at all. Sometimes while they physically oppose to that impregnation and to having their bodies and genitals and anus penetrated. You can see videos of how cows are impregnated in the dairy industry yourself.

Supposing you oppose that this happens to non-human animals, the logical thing would be to stop paying to companies for doing this to non-human animals. Unless you think that animals don't deserve autonomy over their bodies and genitals and reproductive systems...",t2_3smxz96x,1629027843,prochoice

I don’t think abortions are bad but I think myself having an abortion is bad (but if anyone had one it’s perfectly fine to me),"I’ve always thought women should have the right to choose as I am a women myself. There was many days where I wish my mom had chosen to get a medical abortion as we were VERY incompatible to the point of it being high risk for both ends. I always thought, not my story, not my body, not my choice. I’d rather someone pick to get an abortion if it mean they could be happier in life than to continue an unwanted pregnancy and suffer. This has came from me who has suffered from poor financial situations and mental illnesses brought up from nurture and nature. 

The weirdest thing for a while is, I’m okay with anyone having an abortion, but when I think of having one myself I think it’s wrong. I don’t know why I think it’s wrong when I honestly would break all my bones in my body to fight for women’s right. I live in Canada where this is not an issue, yet I still wonder why I feel so morally opposed for one for myself. I am a young female who is still in Highschool who has never came close to a situation for an abortion, so I feel like this is to as of why because you never know how it feels until it happens to you. I was wondering if this is normal for some other Pro-Choicers.

Another rant on the TikTok account thedeathscorts,"TW: Assault

I made a post earlier this year on the TikTok group called “thedeathscorts”. They’re escorts to people who are getting abortions at an abortion clinic in Nebraska.
I just want to say how much effort they put into try to coerce women into going to a prolife center. There’s a man and a wife couple who stand at the entrance of the parking lot to stop them to try to get them to their building. The real escorts have vests on them, and the husband tries to stop the car and try to coerce the woman to go to the prolife center. He or someone made a vest that looks almost like the real ones. His wife is in scrubs to make it look like she’s a nurse (even though she isn’t). When the woman pulls up and stops to talk to them, the husband introduces himself as a doctor. It isn’t technically impersonation since he has a Ph.D, but they don’t know that. The real escorts then tell the patient that they’re protesters. The husband says he works “here” (exact quote). He means where he is standing at the moment. It’s very deceiving. There was one time the husband (I think) physically assaulted the escort who did the videos, and possibly left her with a bloody nose. All he got was a $50 fine and one year of unsupervised probation. It is deeply disturbing how much work these people do to control women. I don’t get who has the time to sit outside abortion clinics screaming at women. The husband and wife look pretty young and they should (or at least one of them) have jobs. I’ve also seen posts where prolifers stand outside Planned Parenthood’s protesting abortion when the specific clinic didn’t even provide abortions. This proves that all prolifers think that all Planned Parenthood’s are evil. They have all the time in the world to stand outside and scream at women, but they don’t even know how to look up where abortion clinics are located. It’s just disturbing and creepy about what they do. I don’t get why they’re obsessed with other peoples lives.",t2_2z4wwep6,1628987759,prochoice
Has anyone been able to decipher the 'extreme' pro lifers reasoning?,"I was debating which sub to post it on, some of the 'ask' subs, but I thought, fuck it. I have literally never been able to get any answers (on facebook for example) other than 'you monster!'

So what do I mean by 'extreme'? I've met pro lifers who think it's not right to abort a fetus with a heart beat. I think it's all nonsense but I understand. I think they are uneducated that the 'heart beat' isn't really a heart beat, and much less signs of cognition.

That being said, the even more extreme ones moaning when a fertilized egg or blastocyst is 'killed' (using morning after pill for example) is some how monstrous. 

""It has POTENTIAL. It's HUMAN."" 

No analogy has been able to make me understand. A patient that is brain dead still deserves dignity because it was once a person. I do support body dignity. What body does the fertilized egg have? 

I don't mean to sound cliche, but it literally IS a clump of cells.

Now lets talk about rape victims. I can understand the pro lifers who say 'you can't kill the baby because YOU chose to have sex.' Still garbage idea, but rape victims didn't choose it. 'The baby can't be killed though!' Yes, but what happens if the victim is a child??? Both scenarios would lead to one child dying. So I don't get the brazilian protesters for example, being against a child, proven to be a victim, getting abortion.",t2_mztn6r8,1628968230,prochoice
Would sexual coercion and rape be more prevalent if abortion was illegal?,"I see a lot of women saying ""he raped me"" or ""poked holes in the condom"" in order to force them to become pregnant in order to stick around. I feel like if abortion was illegal scenarios like this would skyrocket because it would be a guaranteed way for abusers to force the women to say in a relationship, or at the very least force them to see him more often. Rape and coercion mostly go unpunished in the courts, or even make it to court in the first place.

"If you don't want slavery, don't own slaves. But don't tell me or anyone else that they can't own slaves","Illegalizing slavery won't stop slavery. It'll just make it more dangerous. People will start getting slaves in alleyways. Those people don't care about slaves, they just want to control slaveowners. My slave, my choice.

Imagine this. You're in a burning building with a slave and someone who isn't a slave and you can only save one. Which do you save? If you save the one who isn't a slave then clearly it's okay to own slaves. 

Slave rights are human rights. Keep slavery safe, legal, and free. You're not anti-slavery, you're just pro-unemployment. If my mom had enslaved me, that would've been her right and anyone who tried to stop her would've just been trying to control her. 

Slavery saves lives. If I don't want to pay somebody for nine months, I have every right to hire and not pay them. 

I don't enslave them. I just simply don't pay them and then they do the slaving themselves. 

A slave isn't a person. It's just on its way to becoming one. If we don't have slaves, the slave owners are going to have miserable lives and the life of the slave is going to be hard because they'll be out of work. 

A slave isn't a person until their first paid job. Obviously slaves aren't people. That's why we don't celebrate their birthdays and why we don't have funerals for slaves. No one can really know that slaves are human beings. 

Even if slaves are human beings, they have fewer
rights than the owners. No one should be expected to pay their hard-earned money as a money-support system for someone else.

Every person has the right to choose. It would be unfair
to restrict an owner’s choice by prohibiting slavery. Every owner should have control over her own slave.

Signs seen at my county fair,"There was a booth at my county fair that said, ""Pro-life! Pro-woman! Pro-baby! Pro-family!"", with another one that said, ""Every child deserves a wonderful [life]!"" (I didn't see the last word on that one, but it most likely says that; with pictures of beautiful, attractive BORN babies, of course!). My local fairgrounds are also near a Crisis Pregnancy Center where they harass and guilt people out of abortions, and that proudly advertises itself as ""pro-life"", and you are told to go there in my state's abstinence-only ""education"" in school if you ever have an unexpected pregnancy. My state's abstinence-only ""education"" is openly and proudly misogynistic, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, and everything else, where you are taught your worth depends on your virginity at marriage, abortion is murder and always wrong, all girls are future wives and mothers, teen pregnancy is somehow okay, all single pregnant people need to be thrown into homes for unwed mothers, gay marriage is wrong and immoral and gay people are demented child molesters, single parents can't raise mentally healthy children, and if you have sex before marriage, you have ruined your life and your future childrens' lives, you will become a prostitute with STDs, and no man will ever truly want you. Oh, and don't forget that they teach that girls and women who get pregnant outside of marriage should be forced to marry the father, so the baby can have a healthy, happy, heterosexual married couple as parents, but the fathers should be allowed to just get away with anything without having to care for the children if they don't want to, and should be allowed to abandon the mothers and children if they want, and not pay child support, or have a part in the children's lives, and the mothers should have to care for the children all by themselves if the father desires, and the mothers should never be allowed to abandon the children. And, they say the fathers should be the only ones allowed to initiate divorce, never the mothers. 

Also, to get to the fairgrounds, you have to pass my local Planned Parenthood. A couple years ago, while passing it to go to the fair, there were pro-forced-reproductioners protesting outside. My local Planned Parenthood doesn't even do abortions.

Adoption/abortion,"So today I saw post talking about how 16 year old can't adopt child because she's not legal adult, can't provide for the child etc. But if she got pregnant, she couldn't abort either. Most of the comments were supportive saying- ""Her body, her choice"", ""It's clump of cells"" etc. Now, I would like someone to give me actual answer why law shouldn't stay like this? As all of us are ""clumps of cells"", all of us couldn't survive without provider till certain age (let's not forget about people with autism for example, they shouldn't be killed because they can't be independed). They say it's not living being, from the moment male and female cells combine it starts it's developing! Those are just growing phases of a child no matter how small and how undeveloped it is. I agree that teens shouldn't be able to adopt a child as they can't provide for it, and take care of it. Goverment will take care of those children. And I don't think everyone should be able to abort, as it was their choice to have sex in the first place (victims of rape should have choice), they should have been aware of possible consequinces! If they can't provide for the child, they can put it up for adoption. 1 is them wanting child either and the other one is choosing to kill the child over allowing it to live. Plus, abortion could make it so girl can no longer get pregnant. Calling men sexist and telling them ""My body, my choice"" is actually very sad, it was two of you who created the baby, it's him whom you're taking away father role and it's him who will have to pay 18 years for a child he didn't want to. To sum it all together, if you're grown enough to have sex at a young age, you should be grown enough yo deal with consequences.

I need to share this story with you,"Source:https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2017/02/abortion-measles/516312/

The Zika emergency—thankfully now in the past but still without a vaccine—spread throughout 60 countries and affected thousands of pregnant women in 2015 and 2016. The disease is most dangerous for pregnant women due to the risk of birth defects as severe as microcephaly, when the fetus forms a small head and underdeveloped brain. To prevent that gruesome fate for their baby, pregnant women with Zika often turn to abortion (though the procedure is illegal in many of the countries most affected by the virus).
Before Zika, there was the rubella epidemic of 1964 to 1965, when an estimated 12.5 million Americans acquired the disease (also known as German measles). Similar to Zika, rubella’s symptoms for most adults are mild—a rash and a low-grade fever that lasts two or three days. But for a pregnant woman and her fetus, rubella is “very dangerous,” according the CDC, resulting in birth defects ranging from deafness to heart problems to mental disabilities. Also like Zika, rubella is often asymptomatic, thus many pregnant women don’t realize they’re carrying the virus until it’s too late. In the 1960s, prior to the release of the rubella vaccine in 1969 and the Roe decision in 1973 that made abortion legal nationwide, a small number of doctors illegally performed the procedure for pregnant women with rubella.
One of those women is Bette, an Atlantic reader who had a second-trimester abortion in March 1971. She was a 24-year-old married Christian at the time, and she frames her abortion story as “God’s will for my family”:

My husband and I celebrated my pregnancy with friends on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Although the pregnancy was a bit of a surprise, we were delighted to welcome a baby into the world.
I was teaching fifth grade at the time, and I’ll never forget the moment when a student walked up to my desk and said he didn’t feel very well. When I saw the rash on his face, I flashed back to a terrible photograph I had seen in a magazine in my obstetrician’s office the week before. It was of a “Rubella baby,” and the caption said “Bobby’s mother recovered from German measles in 3 days. Bobby wasn’t so lucky.”
I didn’t know what that meant exactly, but I later found out the way scientists realized what the Rubella virus did to a fetus was when someone connected delivery-room personnel coming down with the three-day measles to a baby with severe birth defects. Although the mother recovers in three days, the baby stays sick throughout the remaining time of gestation and is still contagious at birth.
I had almost forgotten about that student and the magazine picture a couple of weeks later when I got up and saw a very slight rash on my own face.



I covered it up with make-up as best I could and drove 30 miles to school, feeling worse and worse the whole way. Halfway through the morning, I couldn’t deny what was happening to me and I cried all the way home. When I called my doctor, he specifically told me not to come in. He knew what was wrong and told me to go to bed and that I’d feel better in a couple of days.
My husband was in the Army at the time, and we felt that we needed to go to our hometown to have support from our family, our church, and the doctor I trusted. My doctor told us about a “therapeutic abortion.” Although he told me about the difference between a simple first-trimester D&amp;C and a second-trimester saline injection, he explained it very gently. He told me that although he couldn’t give me advice, if it were his wife, he would urge her to have an abortion.
As a naive Christian girl, I had never heard the word “abortion.” This was before Roe vs. Wade and I had no idea what was going on in “Women’s Lib” circles at the time.
The reason I didn’t get my abortion until the second trimester was that my Christian family had never faced anything like this before. We were blindsided by the news and needed time to come to grips with what was happening. I wanted to talk to Christian leaders I trusted.
So we turned to our church. My aunt and uncle were missionaries in Taiwan at the time, but they were home on furlough. As a missionary nurse, my aunt agreed with my parents’ Sunday school teacher—a Chief of Cardiac Surgery at a major hospital—that this abortion was within God’s will. They told me that this was a “technology that God has given us in order to prevent more suffering in the world.” On their advice, I went ahead with the procedure.
Although I seldom talk about my abortion, I spent a lot of years being very angry with Christians who made a political issue out of something so deeply personal and spiritual to me. Since I was making one of the hardest decisions of my life, I had spent precious time talking with my Christian support system.
I have since left that church. I had to mask my rage at Christians—Christian MEN in particular who want to have a say in a decision that is between a woman and her God. The way I found peace was in knowing that I sent that little guy, Tory Cameron, back home to be with God.
I look at it the same way now. The suffering that abortion alleviates in the world is the mess we have created because we haven’t figured out a way to take care of the children who are already here. Every story is different, but what the “pro-life” crowd doesn’t want to consider is the fact that abortion is never going to go away—until we figure out a way to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Sometimes that can be a young girl living in poverty who has no way to support a child, or it is a mother addicted to drugs whose baby will be born addicted and possibly severely damaged. And then there are the young girls who are so afraid their families will disown them that they take matters into their own hands and risk the tragic consequences. Bottom line: NO ONE thinks abortion is a good thing.
I don’t know what my life would have been like if I had carried Tory to full term, but I do know that it would have been different. I wouldn’t have the two children I now have. My marriage may or may not have ended earlier, or we might have lived “happily ever after” with a beautiful handicapped child whom we both would have loved.
But I do know two things for sure: First, the decision was mine to make. And second, I will someday be reunited with Tory and we’ll talk about it then. That’s when I will apologize, if necessary",t2_3tmqyqe2,1628845813,prochoice

"Abortions are the highest level of spawnkilling, change my mind","I was silenced before, but I refuse to allow my opinion to be silenced, through stubbornness, and my phat patriotic cock. I have a legitimate question. Give me a reason I have not heard of why abortions are reasonable. For example, saying something like they can't support their kid, because then someone else can, or what I of they don't want to give birth in general. That's the most reasonable argument I've heard, but have still found it immoral and unjust the fact of how you could kill a product of you and someone else. If you don't want a kid, don't have sex. It's that simple. But what if you do, why its simple, suck it up. This may be cruel, but its like the question, would you rather lose a leg and save a life, or let the person die, and you are completely fine. Which even that is a stretch, because all your doing is giving birth. I know it hurts, but I still argue that it is vulgar and almost childish to respond with going for the easier pathway even though it screws over others. One, also reasonable excuse is, if you have a medical issue, to which I will still respond, don't have sex. If you can't deal with the consequences of having sex, then don't. There is no easier way to explain this. I dare people to give me a just, morally correct outlook on this, and something that no one has ever heard before. Good luck",t2_87b6ghbq,1628814387,prochoice

Why Mandatory Vaccination isn't a prochoice talking point.,"I've seen too many people in the last few days advocating for vaccination being optional in the name of medical freedom and bodily autonomy.

""Bodily autonomy is indeed an important thing to fight for in the name of freedom when the decisions being made for the body only affect the individual making the choice (ie: abortion, HRT, body modification, etc)

But when the decision impacts the species as a whole it must be mandated. In this case, wether or not you choose to get a vaccine not only impacts you but impacts wether or not new strains of the virus have the ability to mutate and thrive. And in doing so threaten the health and lives of others.

I really need to stay away from the comment section when it comes to these posts. Of course the forced birthers came in and couldn't keep their mouths shut.

Then this disgusting comment was made:

""If my daughter was raped I would make sure her assailant does the maximum sentence and she will carry my grandbaby to term... It is not for us to decide how life is created... It is for us to care for it and guide it to a greater purpose.""

Someone asked him if he thinks he's control how his daughter lives and he said ""I wouldn't have to, I'd raise her right"".

My god it makes my skin fucking *crawl*. This man is perfectly ok with his daughter getting traumatized by carrying her rapists baby and going through birth. He would force his views onto her so she won't ever consider abortion, even if she does consider it he wouldn't let that happen. He wants to control his kid and cause horrible mental and physical pain and suffering onto his kid because ""abortion is murder"". He would keep her daughters rapists baby against her will and it's not his fucking choice to make. It's not his body and not his choice.

I have a question. Why do pro-lifers say life begins when a heartbeat starts,"I hear many people say, you shouldn’t abort a fetus once it has a heartbeat because it is a living person. This doesn’t make sense to me. When a person is alive and they die, we don’t consider them legally dead until their brain activity stops. If their heart stops but they still have brain activity they are still legally alive. So one would assume that we also wouldn’t consider someone alive until they have brain activity. So I guess my question is, why do we consider a fetus alive when they get a heart beat and not when they get brain activity. Is it just a way they can make abortion illegal at an earlier time in pregnancy or something else?",t2_8rnbtnn9,1628636915,prochoice

Experience at my school today,"Im a senior in highschool and because of the way my classes and schedule worked out for the last years I've ended up taking the mandatory health class my senior year. I'm going to state the city where I live but the state I live in is Texas which is considered a conservative state (although gerrymandering has a big role is why it's conservative) and today our assignment was to read the beggining of the textbook and define the vocabulary in our words as well as read and sign the syllabus. The syllabus states that sex education is abstinence only and in the textbook it claims that abstinence enhanced your life and improves your health and makes you happier in the long run and says that options like birth control can ruin your health and it says that having sex ""will normally make you upset, feel guilty, and be regretful, especially later in life""...that's a direct quote from the book. I understand discouraging teens/minors from having sex but it's 2021 and we are still teaching abstinence only sex ed? Seriously? It's not even that I'm sexually active (I'm not) it's about the pro life hypocrisy of not teaching what's nessacary to prevent unplanned pregnancy and about being other people being prepared for sexual activity later in life and not feeling scared and dirty.

Bad Prolife Arguments: an anthology,"Ever wonder where the prolifers on Reddit get their bad arguments? Ever wonder why they’re all eerily similar? Well, I actually decided to read through the PL sub’s sidebar links so you don’t have to! These were meant to be “rebuttals” to common prochoice arguments, so I took the time to debunk each one. Hopefully this will save you all some time in debates. 

(Had to put spaces in between the links to avoid it hyperlinking)


https://elizabethprolife.wordpress .com/2014/06/24/bodily-integrity-abortion-part-iii/

“Pregnancy is not assault because as a bystander you wouldn’t be compelled to operate on a pregnant person that you found unconscious like you would intervene in a rape of an unconscious woman.” What??

“Intervening in a possible rape scenario is a violation of bodily autonomy of the woman if you misunderstood and she actually wanted the sex.” Uhh… no? Also, this is not the same as OPERATING ON SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 

It also throws out the argument of “taking responsibility for consequences” since pregnancy is somehow just a consequence and not an ongoing process. But it says “responsibility isn’t killing someone because it hurts others” and ignores the bodily autonomy argument. 


https://humandefense .com/consent-to-sex-is-not-consent-to-pregnancy-a-pro-life-womans-perspective/

“You technically can’t consent to pregnancy because consent is supposed to be between two people and you can’t give consent to something that doesn’t understand you.” Uhh…
“You’d technically be assenting.”
Ok, cool, so whether I “assent” or not determines if my bodily autonomy is violated or not. Dumb semantics game. Doesn’t attack the BA argument at all. 

https://blog.equalrightsinstitute .com/bodily-rights-arguments-necessitate-extremism/

Basically, if any PL says that PCs focus too much on edge cases (rape, deadly pregnancy complications, etc), show them this link where this person hyperfixates on third trimester abortions and calls it “horrific” for anyone to support them, ignoring the reasons they happen to begin with. Also, black and white thinking, much?

http://doc.jfaweb .org/Training/DeFactoGuardian-v03.pdf

If you’re wondering why PLs occasionally bring up bizarre scenarios about kidnapping, a cabin in the woods, and a baby, this is probably where they got it from. It leans heavily on the concept of “moral intuition” and the concept of “the obligations of a de facto guardian.” Basically, this guy concludes that if you’re in a scenario where you are the only person who could take care of a child (or ZEF), then you have to take care of them or else you are a bad person. Of course, this is used to justify not aborting rape pregnancies. 

Children should not be entitled to care unless the care is voluntary. Ideally, a child would not exist if parenting resources and care will not be available, which is why I advocate for abortion. PLs are the only people who think all accidental children MUST be born and that childcare from someone specific is mandatory. 

Basically, stating that parents have an obligation to their child only makes sense if they consented (or “assented,” according to that other post) to raising said child. To consent to care ensures that the child will be cared for to the best of the guardian’s ability. That their heart is in it. Mandating a specific person must care for a child by law without their consent is a recipe for child abuse. 

https://blog.secularprolife .org/2018/11/mcfall-v-shimp-and-thomsons-violinist.html?m=1

I don’t have too much of an issue with this argument. I’m not married to McFall v Shimp and the Violinist examples, and I don’t think anyone makes the argument that they are perfectly analogous to pregnancy. What I do take issue with is their description of what would make a perfect analogy to pregnancy:

“You chose to risk making this person’s life depend on you.” And “your refusal means actively killing this person, not just neglecting to save him.”

Again, pregnancy isn’t “forcing someone into dependency” when the alternative option is nonexistence (unless you’re an antinatalist and you are arguing for the preference of the latter). No one is at fault for the dynamics of pregnancy. It is also different than taking someone who was previously independent and making them dependent on you. And even if that was the case, I’d still argue that person doesn’t have the right to your body. 

Obviously in a lot of abortion cases, you and your doctor actively kill the ZEF inside of you. But is not doing that “saving them?” Do we even have the obligation to actually “save” someone at risk to bodily harm to ourselves? Legally, no, and morally I agree with the law (though I can’t remember the name of said law/laws, so I apologize). 


http://thefetalposition .com/forceddonation/

This outlines the “we just don’t want it to be killed” argument they throw at us when we explain that they’re arguing that others are entitled to pregnant peoples’ bodies. It doesn’t really give any good arguments against this, only that “active killing is always bad.”

Secondly, it goes into that argument of “responsibility,” aka, that violent portrayal of sex that makes it sound like it’s all the mother’s fault that the ZEF is dependent, which I debunked above. Sex isn’t “mugging a 72-year-old and accidentally injuring them in the process” as the article so delicately describes. 

This one also appears to be where the “should you steal a body part back from a donor-recipient” argument comes from. I’d argue that a bodily autonomy violation in this case is not “continuously ongoing.” The body part being used is separated from you, and further damage is not being done to you by it being used by the recipient. The violation is the organ theft, nothing more. 

“The Right to Life is a negative, natural right.
“Negative” means it is better understood as the “right to not be killed” and does not entitle you to life-saving medical care.”

Sure, and bodily autonomy is a negative right that means that no one can use your body without your consent. The ZEF is the aggressor here. It is not “innocent.”

Also, this article does not list “organ donation” as part of “basic care and obligations” for children, and lumps it in with other “non-essentials” like helicopter rides and going to Disney World… which reads just a little bit odd. 

—-

Now, the last link is an actual post on the PL forum listing instances where “right to life” trumps bodily autonomy. I can sort this list into three categories: cases against self harm, cases for adequate child care, and things that don’t involve BA at all (for instance, the draft and laws against assault). 

The cases for self harm are at least self-contained. You’re not arguing that anyone is entitled to your body, it’s just limiting what you do to yourself, which is a separate debate. I do believe that every child should get the best care possible, but only if that care is given voluntarily. This only makes sense if abortion is legal, safe, free, and easily accessible. I also feel like this should apply to in-utero situations. If you choose to give birth to a child, you should be obligated to care for it during pregnancy to the best of your ability. Otherwise, abort it. If the child is already born and you change your mind about raising them, then give them up to someone else. Don’t keep them and abuse them.",t2_mz5ef,1628451711,prochoice

I had a baby when I was 14 years old. Here’s what my pro life family members had to say.,"I was 14 and the dad was 18 when he was born. He had me hide the pregnancy because he knew he’d get in trouble. I ended up going into labor at 26 weeks and 6 days. I delivered in an ambulance just outside the hospital. My aunt said I shouldn’t be allowed to keep him, she’d adopt him if I didn’t keep him. My maternal grandfather said I deserved to be punished and forced to give him up for adoption. These two are the most “pro life” people in my family and had I gotten an abortion they probably would have disowned me. Told me I should’ve dealt with the consequences of my actions. But since I didn’t I was all of the sudden too immature to keep and raise a baby. Long story short I kept him, he’s happy and healthy. And those family members still are the first to talk mass shit about my life and my parenting. But they’re the last people to offer help when I need it. Having a baby at 14 years old also made me incredibly pro choice. NO ONE should have to carry a pregnancy they don’t want, no matter if you’re 14 or 34. Pregnancy and raising a child are so hard, it’s not for everyone. So anyways that’s all I came to share, I hope everyone has a great day.",t2_5bezdwmm,1628353604,prochoice

Women don’t matter and are incubators.,Idk why but this has been on my mind lately. But for some reason I think women are very devalued and dehumanized when pregnant? Like all anyone can talk or ask about in the baby and I don’t often hear anyone ask how the mother is doing physically or mentally. It’s just that the baby is the biggest deal and the mom is just decoration. Don’t get me wrong I know pregnancy can be a nice and exciting experience for some but still. I’ve also heard about random strangers giving unsolicited advice for the baby’s sake and just touch pregnant bellies like creeps with a pregnancy fetish. Then when it comes to birth it seems like the baby is a bigger priority and the mom is the object they need to remove it from. Many force the women on their backs I have heard stories of doctors and nurses being so disrespectful and rude to birthing mothers. I also feel like even subconsciously doctors are more motivated to save the baby rather than women if a serious problem happens. I know some mothers would die for the baby but I personally wouldn’t want to. I feel like though the doctors would be more motivated to save the baby anyway. All this is just another reason personally to me why I never want to get pregnant and have a baby. I also just am uncomfortable with babies/ small children and enjoy not taking care of children and being free of the responsibility and stress but that’s not the point lol. I personally don’t see the joy but that’s me. This might just be weird but I’ve been thinking about this for some reason.

I saw a post on the pro-life sub about prolifers wanting an intellectually disabled teenager to keep the baby,"TW: Rape

I saw a post on the prolife sub about a mother who was going to get her 14 year old daughter, who is intellectually disabled and was raped, an abortion. The people brought up the girls bodily autonomy. I know not every case with intellectually disabled people are the same, but the girl must have had it so severe that she couldn’t make the “good” decision to keep the baby. They kept saying adoption was better. One person said that if the baby was put up for adoption, they should find a good home for the baby so she could visit it and the family. Another one said that having the baby would be more traumatic than an abortion because she would see the baby as real. Okay, these people are just so wrong. An intellectually disabled girl might have bad social skills, and she might not know or understand why she would basically visit a stranger. I’m not a psychologist, so I don’t know if having a baby taken away is traumatic. This girl might not even have interest in the baby. And *only* having a baby and seeing it taken away is traumatic? Have any of these people have been pregnant and/or given birth? I’ve never been pregnant or given birth, but those are pretty major things that prolifers overlook. These people see women as incubators. This girl might not know what happened to her was wrong, what pregnancy is and what is happening to her body, and might not understand how traumatic, physically and mentally, giving birth is. Two things I have learned about prolifers: they want abortion to be illegal and only care about the fetus.

There will always be the murder debate but the murder thing is moral opinion and no hardened facts. Even though some say the fetus can feel pain after 20weeks, it’s never been scientifically proven. Any cell in the human body is alive and for most of the time that is what a fetus is. A gigantic cell. So yes it technically is life but when studying the parts of a single cell and how cells can die a be destroyed do we mourn it? No. People just get upset because it will eventually if allowed become a human newborn. But until then it’s just cells with no developed human consciousness. Humans think they are superior and the life that matters the most while they don’t bat an eyelash when killing animals or even tearing down trees. Animals feel pain and have feelings and are smart but since they aren’t human we don’t deem it morally wrong to kill them that much.

Imagination and pregnancy,"We need to stop the ""dreamlike"" lies about pregnancy that our own minds make for us.

It's nice to try to only see the good about something that harms you so much like pregnancy and cute to think of the fetus you're growing is this developed, intelligent, loving little person that weeps at the thought of being aborted.

The thing is that none of these are facts. Your own emotions on a subject shouldn't be affecting the body of another person who could have totally different views.

There is no real emotion behind pregnancy, it's a biological process that you can choose whether or whether not to give value or emotion.

Prolifers like to play on emotions by litreally manipulating you and making you feel guilty when you have nothing to feel guilty about.

""Loves you""
""Wants to live""

At the same time they completely ignore the woman, not only during pregnancy but also during labor. They care so much about a fetus feeling a few minutes of pain but are fine with forcing you into labor.

Link to the quote (in italian but you can copypaste It on a translator) https://canestrinilex.com/risorse/padre-a-propria-insaputa-come-comportarsi/


By financial abortion i mean the possibility for the biological father of the child to forfeit all rights and responsability toward the not yet Born child by signing documents, hence ""paper abortion"".
He won't be on the hook legally for any form of financial support however, he can't actively look for/try to have a relationship with the child, were the mother to decide to keep It.
So basically, he Will live his Life like this child has been aborted.
Personally, i think this Is the Natural consequence of legalising abortion for women if the woman doesn't want to keep It; why should anyone be forced into unwanted parenthood?",t2_bow3ypep,1628069571,prochoice

"Why is abortion, even if we do consider it murder, arguably the most controversial type of ""murder"" whereas state-sanctioned murders actually do exist and never get protested?","Obviously, the main answer would be patriarchy. But, I am consistantly baffled as to why we constantly debate the legitimacy of abortion, it's definition and legality, mainly on the behalf of whether it is murder or not, whereas a serious debate on state-sanctioned murder \*never\* existed.

Policing and military interventions are considered normal and to and to an extent also death penalty (in the US for example). Never are these, completely legal, acts of actual taking away of life - a grown, adults and in the cases of military often innocent civilian lives, debated as ""murder allowed by the state but never banned"". However, abortion, which doesn't even fall under the same category constantly falls under scrutiny in which these other murders do not.

Why was a ZEF excluded from the definition of a parasite?,"Why was the zygote/embryo/fetus excluded from the definition of the word parasite?

[This](http://www.thelizlibrary.org/liz/004.htm) webpage has a little blurb at the bottom of it that says that the fetus was excluded intentionally from the definition of ""parasite."" There's no source for this.

&gt; Is the fetus a parasite?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The short answer is: YES. The medical definition of ""parasite"" traditionally refers to a different species, but this is an arbitrary criterion, and relaxing somewhat. The ""different species"" requirement was included in the definition specifically to eliminate pregnancy. However, the delineation of what constitutes a ""different [species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species)"" (organisms unable to reproduce, or at least unable to reproduce fertile offspring) is not always so clear. Consider the many common examples of cross-species pregnancies, for example, a cross between a tiger and lion (a ""tigon"" or ""liger""), or horse-donkey pregnancies that result in a mule or hinnie, including occasional examples of fertile offspring. Would those pregnancies then involve a parasite-host relationship, but not ""same-species"" pregnancies? What about gestational surrogacy, in which the mother is not genetically related to the fetus? Scientists are now unsure of whether the Neanderthals really were a different species of human. Human beings themselves may have been involved in cross-species pregnancies 30,000 years ago. In fact, in all functional ways, the fetus meets the definition of an ""obligate parasite"" (a parasite completely unable to live outside of the host). The smaller or incomplete twin in a set of assymetrical conjoined twins may be also considered medically to be a human parasite. While calling a fetus a ""parasite"" is upsetting and shocking to some, because it carries a repulsive connotation that does not fit with the reality of a loved and wanted child, there really should not be emotional baggage attached to cold facts. We all are hosts to billions of parasites, and biologically, actually have a far more symbiotic relationship with our gut flora than a mother has to a fetus. -- liz  


And when I do a google search, I'm unable to find much about the origins of the definition in regards to this. I suspect if this is factual, it would be buried in a biology or embryology textbook or something.

So wondering if anyone else has any insight on this. The fetus actually fits all of the criteria for a symbiotic-parasitic relationship with the pregnant person. This ridiculous hangup on it being of the same species just seems really arbitrary.

Intuition tells me that we tend to think of a parasite like a foreign invader and people don't like the idea of a fetus being seen that way. But... it kind of is. Recently watched a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1lA9g_8wBw&amp;t=2567s&amp;pp=sAQA) about the origins of the mother/child bond and they have learned that the placenta origins come from that of a virus, that infect our ancestors and merged itself with our genome. This began the change from egg laying mammals to what we know of today as pregnancy. This kind of lends some credence even further to the idea of a fetus acting parasitically, considering without that change to our genome, we would still be laying eggs and having a much different conversation about this topic, if at all.

Ultimately, it's not a huge deal - doesn't change how I feel about abortion. And it doesn't change that it functions more like a part-of her whole body much in the way her other body parts function with her.",t2_6gi7y,1627977935,prochoice

I have fallen out with my religious family because I am vegan and pro-choice,"Bit long but wanted to share because it's made me laugh to see how irrational pro-lifers are, I'm 22f for info. My grandma and aunt are religious, very against abortions and post their propaganda all over facebook and will talk about it in front of us. Not quite preaching but will mention it and we will ignore. My aunt also stands outside the abortion clinic in our city once a week which I think is disgusting. Me, my mum and my sister are all pro-choice and they know that. They are also super against the vaccine due to them believing the links between aborted foetus cells from the 60’s and the vaccine. 

Anyways, I decided to become vegan. I told my grandma 2 months ago and she got mad and said ""I don't understand you, you care about animals but don't care about killing babies"" I just laughed at her because she's irrational. She calmed down later and asked me a few questions as to why and I answered honestly. I see her around twice a week and she has been insufferable ever since, repeatedly bringing it up and being critical of veganism in a subtle way. It's worth noting that she and my aunt are vegetarians - so I thought they would at least be accepting. 

The other week I was at her house looking for a snack, she kept offering me things with cheese in and I laughed and said ""I don't think you get what being vegan means"" as a joke and she blew up at me and said ""I'm vegetarian and I don't care about it and I will continue to abuse animals for milk instead I care about the poor little babies that are killed"", I think it is worth noting that I'm not a preachy vegan at all. Do what you want I literally do not care lol. I asked her what being vegan has to do with abortions as it is not relevant, she told me that she is making perfect sense to her. I told her I don't give a fuck about any dead babies and to stop talking about it. I left the room and she went quiet and eventually lightened her tone but continued to complain to my mum that I must expensive and difficult being vegan and my mum stuck up for me. Fast forward to yesterday, she brought up my veganism at least 15 different times. She kept asking about the logistics of veganism so I explained, she didn't believe what I was saying and told me I should speak to a farmer to learn the truth lol. I told her maybe she should watch a documentary to educate herself and she laughed and said I only watch documentaries about humans (pro-life ones she means). I bit later she turned her nose up at my oat milk tea and said it looked disgusting. I jokingly said ""Oh grandma, respect my life choices"" as I walked out the kitchen, I heard her mutter something, I asked what and she looked all smug and said ""no comment"" - I can only presume it was more pro-life bs. 

When I came home, I sent her a 3 minute video about the dairy industry as I was pissed off with her attitude earlier. She replied with a picture of an aborted baby that was apparently killed with chemicals and replied, ""cruelty everywhere even beautiful babies burned to death with chemicals die in great agony"" and then another of a protester with a 'abortion is murder' sign. I replied and said the images didn't bother me and that she needs to see veganism and pro-life separately and neither is morally superior to the other. She said neither killing animals and babies is moral, but one is a human with a soul and she feels sorry for me if I don't care about babies being killed. I replied again that they are two different issues and I care for one and she cares for another, she needs to see past it as I am sick of the two being compared and I don't care to hear her snide comments anymore. She asked what comments and I listed them all and some of what I have written above. I clarified that I am 100% pro-choice and said I don't care to be preached at so I aren't preaching to others about my choice of veganism. She replied 'Don't talk to me about animal rights' which ironically, I never have apart from sending her that video, everything I have said has been in response to her questions. I replied ""Unlike you, I don't bother preaching my beliefs or opinions on people I know who don't give a fuck. Don't talk to us about abortions, vaccines or religion as we do not care"". She replied cancelling all of our upcoming plans. Radio silence since and it has been great.

Does anyone have any thoughts about veganism in comparison to pro-choice/pro-life?

Briefly for me, I have never questioned abortions, I am 22 and it seems absurd in this modern age that women do not have a say in their body, a woman who has been born, is a living being and her opinions and rights far outweigh what I believe is a non-sentient clump of cells until after the abortion time limit passes.",t2_150o4p,1627934115,prochoice

God and spontaneous abortion,"A miscarriage is a spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion is an “act of God.” In the world God has created, fertilized human eggs die each day. Some die because of genetic abnormalities, not human intervention. Many die for no discernible reason: the woman is healthy, the egg is healthy but for some reason fails to implant in the uterus. In the world God has designed, an unsupported heavy object invariably falls to the ground; but in the same world, human pregnancies are not invariably successful. God could have designed the world so a human pregnancy was always successful, but did not. If God doesn’t approve of terminated human pregnancies, then why was a world created where so many occur? If God “hates” abortion so much, then why do so many spontaneous abortions occur?

Pregnancy being natural is a better argument for us than for forced birth,"Forced-birth supporters are always justifying their actions by saying pregnancy is simply the natural function of a woman's body. Yet nature does not create morality: Despite being natural, reproduction can cause women serious, lasting physical harm, and can be psychologically traumatic as well, especially if it happens to an unwilling person.

The biological, involuntary nature of ovulation and conception is a major reason why any kind of mandatory pregnancy is an offense against human rights. Patients do not get pregnant with the intention of aborting. Conception happens on its own through a normal action that fulfills an emotional need. People who have not committed a crime or done anything immoral can easily find their entire bodies being legally used by force, even after attempts to prevent themselves from being impregnated.

Under anti-abortion laws, one half the population, unlike the other half, do not have the inherent right not to be compelled to serve others' interests with their body parts, due to their inborn gender. Women are sentenced to fewer human rights simply because of the way their bodies work.

In my view, this reveals a lot of the pro life hypocrisy in that most of them don't actually think abortion is murder and is always wrong. They just don't like the idea of women being able to get them whenever **they** want them. To them, the idea of individual women having full control of their bodies is too much. They're okay with abortion sometimes, but only when they- the pro lifers- are in control, and decide that the abortion is morally acceptable. This usually means if the woman was raped or if being pregnant is literally going to kill her.

What really got me thinking about this was a tik tok going around about the author who wrote how whites can remain on top. One part of this is how all white children need to be carried to term. This feels grounded in fact as there are many hispanic women who are sterilized against there wishes at the border. Plus the many black women who have historically been forcefully sterilized. 

If the pro life movement really cared about a baby's bodily autonomy, then why don't they care about the WOC who often have that right taken away.

Rehumanize International,"I don’t know if anyone’s noticed, but lately there’s been a rise in popularity of “pro-life leftism,” an answer to the accusation that forced-birth advocates do not promote humans’ welfare after they are born. Rehumanize International is one such organization. Abortion is their main issue, but they oppose the death penalty, have a page on police violence, and work with a group called World Beyond War.

Despite the compassionate image they try to project, they aren’t much different than the usual right-wing groups as far as their treatment of abortion care and patients. There’s a training manual for “sidewalk advocates” on their website: They still stand outside clinics, telling women they are about to kill their own child. They shout at people going to their cars or walking away from them into the clinic. (Oh, and it’s not shouting--it’s “projecting their voices.”) If a patient is having an abortion because the pregnancy poses a greater-than-average threat to her health, the advocates steer them towards getting a second or third opinion from an anti-abortion ob/gyn: a provider with an agenda, who will put the pregnancy before the existing patient. And while the previous one might have been their most directly dangerous approach, I found it particularly violating that if a patient says she’s not there for an abortion, and the advocate knows the clinic performs exclusively abortions, they tell her they know she’s lying and force their advice on her anyway.

Their blog has a piece called [Restorative Justice After Abortion | Rehumanize](https://www.rehumanizeintl.org/justice-after-roe) that claims rather than taking punitive measures, their goal is to create a culture in which abortion is no longer seen as necessary, and to help women “heal” from their chosen healthcare. There’s a lot of sunshiny, empty babble about systemically shifting the foundation of communities and whatnot, I had to dig to find anything substantive. The gist was that rather than imprisoning patients and their doctors, it claims, Rehumanize’s goal is to have a counseling and mediation session in which patients must apologize to the father’s and their own families as well as the community for terminating their pregnancies, and “make restitution”--whatever that means. 

I found it interesting that so much of the content was undefined. What is this “restitution”? Who is the “victim” who was repeatedly mentioned? It would seem to be the aborted pregnancy, but the “victim” in this justice model has the right to give input. Is this person the father of the pregnancy? 

If it is, Rehumanize seems reluctant to say so. Maybe because they know it’s a bad look to frame men as oppressed by women who protect their own bodies--men who caused the pregnancy for their own pleasure. So they obscure the violent male entitlement and focus on polishing their image by talking about their non-punitive solutions to abortion.

Of course we can see it’s all rubbish. They intend to humiliate women by dragging them in front of their entire community and forcing them to apologize for defending themselves, as if they were public property. It does raise the question: What if patients refuse to apologize? What if they won’t attend the session at all? Will they be dragged? Will they face consequences to coerce them to do as authorities demand? Preventing wanted abortions is not possible without exerting force against women, but Rehumanize International won’t admit that because it doesn’t align with the projected progressivism.

If you’re interested in reading more about this movement of pro-forced birth liberals, some key phrases are “consistent life ethic” and “pro-life for the whole life.” I would really like to see it talked about more, because FB advocates have always been assumed to be conservative. These people pose a special threat because they hide their agenda in appealing language.",t2_89mlri23,1627414708,prochoice

Not funny.,"  

At this point, I don’t know. When I first read a certain person ‘s post in PL subreddit, I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. Maybe its just me being overly sensitive about something that my very own ancestors suffered from, for about 100 years, till less than a few decades ago. It basically was him editing an argument justifying slavery. This is what he had to say about what he had done:

&gt;Switched the word for 'black person' with 'foetus' in a 1862 slavery argument and decided to post it to the prochoice sub. Becomes the most up voted post of the day. Do you think it's fair to say that some arguments for slavery are used to justify abortion?

The article did strike as odd, even when I did not know it was a troll. The latter half of the op(edited to fit as a pc argument) in pc subreddit, did not make sense to the slightest. It implied that all fetuses should be aborted and then said something from the Bible. No PCer would use the Bible as an argument. I just moved on, thinking my lack of understanding was due to the usage old English in the text. But when I saw it in the PL subreddit, I was shocked. I see it as an attempt to use slavery to justify their own arguments. He said that he was implying that  a fetus (that is in fact not like any born person) if “dehumanized”, would be same as how slavery was justified, by dehumanizing black people. I believe that it would have been my problem if I didn’t see it that way, only if the motive was actually what he wrote(against “dehumanizing” a fetus). But what irks me is that, there, he says twice, or maybe more than that, he finds it funny. I don’t see what is funny in this? Is slavery funny? Is abortion funny? What is funny? 

As someone has already said in a post about it in r/abortiondebate , it would have been valid only when black man=fetus. They are not. Anyone with two braincells can tell, a fetus not like a born human. Nor is slavery same as abortion. He did write in PL, that changing one word in a sentence which is horrible does not mean it automatically becomes horrible in changed version. The example he gives is changing the word Jews to convicted murderers in the sentence - ""It's justifiable to kill Jews.""  

This is a direct quote from one of his replies

&gt;In my post about abortion, changing the subject doesn't change anything to do with innocence, self defense, humanity.

A fetus is inside the womb, its mere existence causes physical discomfort, often with mental issues and causes deficiency of various vital nutrients. It also can sometimes lead to life long complications and the even the death of the mother. If the fetus is a human, that means it is consciously doing harm.  If an actual human did what a fetus does to the mother, would they be innocent? No. So that means the fetus not innocent? I don’t think so.

He tries to show as if he only changed the word black man/slave to fetus and Voila! PCers agree with him! What he actually did was, to edit it more than that, deliberately to fit it in and pass it of as a PC argument. But maybe manipulating is a PLer thing. 

Difference between slavery and abortion

Under which circumstance is slavery justified? Absolutely none. Is abortion justifiable? YES! Even most PLers agree with abortion in certain cases. The people who justified slavery, did so by going against obvious science. A man of certain race is in no way less of any human. If a fetus was a human, it wouldn’t be living in a womb. It won’t be attached by a cord to some other human, sucking nutrients. So it basically thrives by exploiting another person. By what I just said, trying to fit a fetus and a mother in a slave and slave owner narrative would only make sense if the fetus was in position of a slave owner and and a mother in a slave's. No human's entire existence is depended on violating another human's bodily anatomy. 

I see it not as an argument against dehumanizing a fetus, but to intentionally choosing to IGNORE the very obvious difference between a human and potential human and present PCers like slave owners. NOT FUNNY.",t2_7od51oza,1627274969,prochoice

Apparently some men think women having access to abortion is a privilege…and here’s why that is wrong,"So unfortunately Im involved in the cess pool that is tik tok and I legitimately had a man tell me that women in American society are more privileged then men because we have laws protecting our reproductive rights while men have none…the last time I checked most AMAB people can’t get pregnant, but for the sake of argument we’re going to ignore that obvious sentiment. Now I don’t know what rock this guy has been living under but the last time I checked. 

-Texas put a $10,000 bounty on the heads of women who want access to an abortion 

-girls as young 11 are raped by men and determined by the law to be forced to carry out that pregnancy to full term because the seed of their rapist is more valued than the literal life of an 11 year old child. 

-The Heartbeat Bill that prevented women from getting an abortion because of the detection of a fetal heart beat as early as 6 weeks gestation when most women don’t even know that they’re pregnant until 6 weeks gestation. 

-Men scream crying over the fact that child support exists as if men also don’t actively participate in sex, but then get mad when women have an abortion. Proving that they don’t give a shit about women or child support at all. I honestly don’t even know what they want as this point because they constantly contradict themselves. 

-The use of contraceptives and birth control not only targeted towards women and have the worst side effects compared to their only contraceptives which is condoms, but also now till this day BC is still stigmatized as something only “sluts” use. 

-Women dying from trying to give themselves miscarriage or at home abortions because they know they don’t have the means to support a child.

&gt; The world “forced” is emotionally manipulative whether that’s the intention or not.


Me:


&gt; Eh, I disagree. If one wants to ban abortions, he or she is forcing women to continue with a gestation and birth a baby instead of having an abortion.

&gt;We can’t say choice birthers because it is literally eliminating one of the two options and forcing the woman to go with pregnancy against the woman’s will.

&gt;Tell me a better term when one is not allowed to do something against their will.


Prolife

&gt; Also there are more than 2 choices? Not gettting pregnant on the first place (either thru abstinence or using bc) Keeping the baby and raising it, giving the baby up for adoption


Me:


&gt; And this is why I question whether prolifers actually know how pregnancy works.

&gt;We don’t have time machines. We can’t “not get pregnant” if the woman is pregnant. So that is not an option and it is stupid to suggest that is an option to a pregnant woman. You can take steps before a pregnancy (we can’t ever fully exclude pregnancy due to possibility of rape)

&gt;What has to happen for adoption to occur? Birth. This isn’t freaking Stat Trek where we can teleport a fetus out of the womb.

&gt;Do prolifers think women lay eggs? If a woman is pregnant, we have two choices. Abortion or birth.


Prolifer post reply 1 (she made two posts to reply to the last poat)


&gt; As for your last point, there are multiple reasons why a woman might not want to give birth (don’t want to raise a child, don’t want to risk pregnancy complications) so there are multiple options like I already stated


Me:


&gt;Wait? Do you actually think adoptions occur without birth? I am sorry that you think a pregnant woman can give a fetus up for adoption without giving birth. This is perfect example of why prolifers should not be involved in making medical decisions.

&gt;Pregnancy has two outcomes by choice to those who are to stupid to comprehend that. Either birth or abortion. Miscarriage is not a choice.

&gt;Adoption happens after birth. Not getting pregnant occurs before pregnancy.

Federal judges blocks Arkansas abortion ban,"BY: [**Marlee Kokotovic**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/marlee-kokotovic/) \- July 23, 2021

Read the article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/07/23/federal-judges-blocks-arkansas-abortion-ban/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/07/23/federal-judges-blocks-arkansas-abortion-ban/)

A federal judge just temporarily blocked Arkansas’ extreme abortion ban which is a huge win for rights advocates. 

Arkansas is one of several states that have passed abortion restrictions challenging the constitutional right to the procedure established in Roe v. Wade. Judges have temporarily blocked laws restricting abortions in states including Ohio, Arkansas and Texas, writes [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/us/arkansas-abortion-ban.html). 

According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/22/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-abortion-ban-calling-law-categorically), U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled on Tuesday that the law signed by Gov. Asa Hutchinson is “categorically unconstitutional” and would cause “imminent irreparable harm” to patients and doctors in Arkansas.

“Since the record at this stage of the proceedings indicates that women seeking abortions in Arkansas face an imminent threat to their constitutional rights, the Court concludes that they will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief,” writes Baker. 

The law was set to go into effect on July 28. It would have banned all abortions in all cases (including rape and incest) except to save the life of pregnant women in a medical emergency. Any doctor who failed to comply with this law would have been punished with up to 10 years in prison or could have been liable for a $100,000 fine. 

This law “is categorically unconstitutional, and plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits,” writes Baker. 

Republican-led state legislatures say otherwise as several other states have also passed abortion restrictions in hopes the newly reshaped Supreme Court will make a final decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 

“This legislation had the dual purpose of protecting Arkansas’s unborn and challenging longstanding Supreme Court precedent regarding abortion. I hope the Supreme Court will ultimately accept this case for review, says Gov. Asa Hutchinson who had signed the law back in March.

But…a woman can get pregnant once a year, how many pregnancies can a man cause in a year? How many men say they feel nothing with a condom and try to persuade the woman not to use one? How many take it off without her consent? How many women can’t take bc? How many pregnancies occur from rape? Could you imagine if every man could just go around causing continuous pregnancies and then choose to walk away with zero responsibility for any of them?

Abortion is about body autonomy. Child support is a separate issue completely. Many say it’s not fair that only a woman gets to choose but have they thought about how only the woman’s body and health are at risk when carrying a pregnancy to term or getting an abortion? 

Financial abortions will never be a thing for many obvious reasons, I just see it get thrown around so much without any actual thought behind it that I needed to rant.",t2_2gjdh0gq,1626955391,prochoice

Invalid prochoice arguments,"Probably gonna get a lot of downvotes for this but it’s my opinion and I want to share it. I’d imagine many of you feel strongly against this so feel free to change my mind. This is meant to be productive, not to call anyone ignorant or invalidate anyone’s opinions.

Also let me say that I am pro-choice myself, but I think this argument completely sucks.

Pro-lifers aren’t arguing that women can’t choose what they want to do with their bodies. They are arguing that abortion is murder. I don’t think “right to choose” or “freedom to act as you please” ever logically excuses murder.

Once again, I’m not saying that abortion is murder or that it should be illegal, but this argument is very illogical and invalid.

The way I see it, this is the argument:

Prolife: “I think that you are actively killing the child that lives inside of you, which is extremely immoral and illegal.”

Prochoice: “Well too bad, it’s my right to choose to do that.”

Am I missing something here?

I think the same thing can be applied to the argument that men should have no say in abortion, and also the argument that prolifers should not care if other people get abortions.",t2_7drd8k0z,1626941028,prochoice

“If a woman can choose if she wants to keep the child surely a man should be able to choose if he wants to pay child support”,"
When I first heard about the issue of men not having to pay child support because the woman “had a choice” I initially agreed with it because I didn’t know how to respond. To me it seemed like a pretty solid argument and, as a young feminist, I was terrified of being labelled a “misanderist” for thinking too hard about issues that seemed like double standards at face value.

After a lot of reassessing however I’ve realised that this entire debate is stupid and is entirely based off of the assumption that abortion is not a form of taking responsibility. Spoiler alert: it is. The definition of responsibility is “the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone” and abortion does exactly that. A child is not a consequence of sex, pregnancy (in these instances) is. Abortion is recognising your duty to deal with your situation and dealing with it in a way you see appropriate. You have dealt with the consequences of your actions and taken responsibility. 

When it comes to pregnancy a woman has to deal with the consequences 100% of the time. She can either choose to follow though with the pregnancy or end it via an abortion. Unfortunately a pregnant woman cannot run away from the issue because it is literally inside of her. However, a man only has to deal with the consequences (in this case the likelihood of paying child support) around 39% of the time and even that is debatable. 

Yes, it is true that a man is at the mercy of the woman’s decision when it comes to the pregnancy, but he is not the one who is actively having to experience this problem physically. Unfortunately that’s just how biology works. This isn’t a social problem it’s literally just how we as humans reproduce. What’s the alternative? Forced birth/abortions? Yikes

Now I know that that doesn’t necessarily clear things up. People will still think that this obligation is unfair because the man has no control over the situation. Except he does.

Sex is absolutely not consent to pregnancy, but when a woman has sex she is accepting the risk of a pregnancy and she needs to plan accordingly incase of that situation happening. If a woman is terrified of the concept of abortion and giving birth and is aware that she could not face that decision then I would simply say to not have sex. Even if you took every precaution possible you’d still have a tiny risk, and if that risk is too much for you then simply don’t engage. I know that sounds pretty pro life of me but it’s true. You can take as many precautions as you like and your likelihood of making that decision goes down every time, but if that tiny risk still poses too much of a threat then simply don’t engage in it. 

This is the same for a man but with child support. Precautions can and should be taken but a man needs to recognise that when he has sex with a woman there is a tiny risk that he will have to financially provide for a child. If the risk of paying child support is simply too much of a threat to him he simply shouldn’t have sex or get a vasectomy. There’s no other way around it. 

I’m trying to be careful with my wording here because I don’t want this to sound like I’m being all conservative and telling people not to have sex. I’m simply saying that when you do have sex you need to be aware that that may be an issue you come across and should plan accordingly. Even if that risk is tiny if it poses too much of a threat then you should either take extreme precautions or not engage in it at all. A mans control over whether he has to pay child support is in square 1 and he should be aware of that. For example, he can plan accordingly by asking the woman about her stances on abortion and letting her know that he would want for her to have an abortion if the situation went wrong. If she disagrees he can simply not engage. 

Even if you’re not convinced by my argument previously let’s look at the alternative rout where this double standard is removed:

Ok so we now exist in a world where men are no longer mandated to pay child support. This is essentially a world where men can stick their dicks in whatever they like and never have any consequences come from it. They can knock up 3 women a day and just leave and never think about it again, leaving these women alone to deal with the problem financially, physically, and emotionally. That isn’t an equal world, it’s a horrific one. Lots of children would grow up deprived and women would experience extreme inequality in the workforce and in the economy. It’s literally a world in which men can do as they please and leave women to reap the consequences. How is that a fair world? Doesn’t sound it to me. 

To conclude I know this argument is a bit all over the place because I wrote this at 3am but I believe it pretty much sums it all up. The system we currently have is the most equal we could possibly get and the other option is literally just a dystopia. A man’s chances of having to pay child support are extremely low if he takes the proper precautions. He may be at the mercy of the woman’s decision when the pregnancy happens, but he accepted the risk of that when he chose to have sex. Other than that there is literally nothing else that can be done. When you advocate for child support being optional you’re basically advocating for men to be alleviated of all responsibility. That’s not very pro life.",t2_c3xtbxuq,1626832612,prochoice

Why i despise the pro life movement,"Well let's see,

- Some of them harass women who try to get an abortion 

- Some of them say they'll take care of the child, but when the day of the delivery comes they are nowhere to be found. Essentially entrapping the mother

- Building upon the last one the excuse they'll use is ""we were busy saving other babies"" 

- Some of them base their arguments on religion (which makes it twice as worse because religion is literally human ignorance)

- Some of them have blown up abortion clinics (an example would be 5/18/1992 on Toronto || unfortunately the criminals were never caught)

- Some of them have KILLED abortion doctors and or staff (an example would be 12/30/1994 on Massachusetts || Shooter : John Salvi) 

- Some of them go to schools to provide biased pro life propaganda to kids (it happened to me in 4th grade)

- Some of them stand with forced birth

- Some of them seriously believe that jizz and a cluster of cells deserves more rights than a fully developed human being

- Some of them use manipulation tactics to achieve their goals (one tactic I saw was asking a doubting mother what she'd name her offspring, then the prolifer would keep referring to the fetus as that name for the rest of the conversation)

- They somehow managed to get a 72 hour waiting period in the state of Missouri where they bombard women with pro life propaganda before allowing a woman to proceed with the abortion

- Some of them are so hypocritical that they only care about stopping abortion if it's done on a human. They don't give a shit about abortion on other animals or about another animals ""baby""

Would you still think abortion should be allowed if artificial wombs existed?,"In this hypothetical scenario, science has advanced to a point in which we can safely remove the fetus from the mother’s uterus and move it to an artificial womb. This can be done at any stage of the pregnancy, and would also stop the effects of pregnancy on the mother. This would also include pregnancies in which the mother’s health is at risk. Then once the baby can be birthed from the artificial womb, the parents would be able to decide wether they keep the child or not. For the sake of the hypothetical, this procedure is accessible and affordable to everyone in the world.  

The reason why this could even be a debate is because killing the fetus would no longer be necessary, in order for it to not violate the bodily autonomy of a woman that does not consent to her organs being used. On the other hand, it could be argued that the mother still has enough authority over the fetus to decide what should happen to it, and the procedure of moving it to the artificial womb is still happening to her body, meaning that they could also decide to have an abortion.

2. if a women have a miscarriage
3. if a women either do something or just not take care of herself resulting in a miscarriage

The ableism argument.,"I’ve noticed lately that a lot of prolifers say that women who find out that while pregnant if they pregnancy were to be carried to full term upon being born the baby would be born with severe disabilities, and they opt for an abortion makes them ableist. Which on a surface level I can see how this could be a plausible argument, however what they try to do is paint these women as selfish and vain which is an emotional “we’re better than them” argument. What they refuse to acknowledge is that why women have abortions when finding out their child is severely disabled is most likely due to them knowing that they won’t have the resources to not only take care of said child but provide them with a good quality of life. Not because they don’t want the child because they’re disabled. The American health care system is fucked, meaning that the average American often doesn’t even have enough to take care of their own health needs first. So who are you to not only try to shame women already in the position of an extremely difficult choice and to try to take away a legitimate option for them? Most pro lifers are on the same political side that doesn’t believe in universal healthcare and or believe that people who have government assistance are lazy and just don’t want to work, which is obviously the farthest from the truth. However until I see pro lifers advocating for universal healthcare and better funding for state sanctioned healthcare and living services for people with disabilities, I refuse to believe that the argument comes from the goodness of their hearts and more just wanting to shame women into having children then once those children or born and still have needs that the government will most likely have to provide they pretend that they don’t exist. Pro lifers if you’re reading this, which I know you are don’t use the issue of ableism to feed your own political agenda if you’re unwilling to acknowledge the needs of a disabled person outside of the womb.",t2_9s0gx5cq,1626731149,prochoice

Abortion isn’t an argument over what life is ‘worth’—its an argument over what defines humanity.,"I started winning abortion arguments when I started asking different questions. The seemingly catatonic points of contention aren’t shifting because we are asking the wrong questions. At its core, the debate over the ethics of abortion begs the question: “what defines humanity?” 

We can argue over the state of a woman’s life, the age of the woman or the fetus, the foster care/adoption system; but it all leads us back to the same point of contention, whether or not the fetus is “alive” and what impact it’s state of life has on its worth in comparison to the uterus holding it. This disagreement only exists assuming that pro-lifers define being alive as having a heartbeat and scientifically “living” body—which is ultimately what makes the argument so weak. Why, then, do they find it okay to eat meat? Was that not living? Is that not actually WORSE than abortion, as a pig or cow or chicken actually has consciousness and a life outside of a placenta? It’s o my different because they define an embryo as “human,” therefore needing protection.

This is the foundation of the pro-life beliefs, tearing it down tears down everything. Why is murder wrong? Well, because it is unfair to rob somebody of a life full of feeling and emotion, fun and friends and family, to end a fully functioning cognition with thoughts and a story; it is unfair to also then rob their love ones of their presence. The idea of a “soul” (the consciousness and sentience of cognition) is generally what makes a living thing “worth” saving—that’s why killing bacteria, although technically alive, is not wrong; bacteria does not have sentience and love ones that miss it. That’s why killing a chicken isn’t equated to killing a grown human, there is a clear difference in emotional intelligence and sentience that is worth protecting. This is also why the come patient analogy used a lot does not hold up—aborting a fetus is not the same as pulling the plug on an unconscious patient because one of them already has a life and a persona, people to miss it, where as the other does not.

What we believe makes something “human” or having a “soul” influences how much value we give it’s life. A mother and the embryo inside of her body are both very much so alive, yes, but their lives have starkly different values when taking in to consideration their levels of sentience.

I find that discussion from this perspective bring about much more progress and thought than the practically ineffective arguing that we often face during abortion debates.",t2_4boo5ek5,1626705879,prochoice
Why I believe abortion isn't same as murdering actual children,"The unborn(ZEF) is still inside the body of the mother and its unwanted presence violates bodily anatomy. If abortion was same as murder, then there would never be any exceptional cases, where aborting ZEF is required for saving a mother's life. I, personally, have never come across a case where a child(after parturition) had to be killed for the well being of mother or any person. While in womb, the unborn is solely depended on the person carrying it. Actions of a mother, like consuming certain medication, suffer any physical injury, travel, or any thing pregnant people are advised not to do would not affect the baby if it is born. Babies(after birth) do not need a specific person for continuation their life, as they did before being born, for giving a baby up for adoption at any instant to can be done without having to wait, causing further damage due to the presence of the an wanted child. 

On moral grounds, no one should be coerced to carry on an unwanted pregnancy, as a pregnancy affects all spheres of well being(physical, mental, social, financial) of the person.

 Now, as for the right of an unborn, I do believe they should be treated as an individual if the pregnant person consents. Saying, ""How can the life of an individual depend upon another individual?"". Well, in this case, it does. If we had the technology to nurture unborn out of a mother's body during any stage of development, there would be no reason for debate. 

Also, saying ""Consent to sex is same as consent to getting pregnant"" is unfair, because it treats the person who is pregnant unfairly, by holding only them accountable, while carefully reducing or completely freeing the other person, who is equally or, often solely, responsible for the pregnancy, of any accountability. It is same as saying ""Consent to eating is same as consent to getting diarrhea"" or ""Consenting to drive a car is same as consenting to getting into a car accident"". In case of getting diarrhea, we take medicine and in case of getting into an accident, we get ourselves treated and claim insurance. Then why should a pregnant person be told to suck it up? Even though another life is at risk, no one is obligated to save someone else by putting themselves in pain.

"What we mean when we say ""it's about controlling women's bodies""","I've pretty much always been pro-choice, but this argument used to confuse the hell out of me. It made me think of a bunch of pro-life conservatives who just hate women so much that they want any excuse to make their lives more difficult. Or that they were pro-life specifically because it's a stance that hurts women. I obviously thought this idea was ridiculous. There might be a few people like that out there, but it's definitely not a popular reason for people to be pro-life, especially considering half of pro-lifers are women.

&amp;nbsp;

Recently I started thinking about this argument again, and I think people (myself included) misunderstand it. I watched a live stream of some youtubers reacting to the TPUSA women's conference not long ago and one of the speakers basically just told the audience (which was mostly high school and college girls) that they all need to settle down and have 5+ kids as soon as possible so conservatives could ""take over the country."" There was another time I heard a youtuber say that women are obligated to have children because of immigration or something.

&amp;nbsp;

These instances not only infuriated me but also shocked me. Now I understand what people mean when they say pro-lifers just want to control women. It's not because they necessarily hate women or want to make life worse for them, it's simply because **they want people to have more kids.** These people are obsessed with traditionalism and ""family values."" They want to live in a perfect 50s utopia where everyone lives the exact same way: the man works full-time, the woman stays home with the kids, they go to church every week, they live in a suburban home with a picket fence, everyone waits until marriage to have sex, etc. They want to enforce this way of life on society which is why they care so much about women having babies, why they hate LGBT people, why they want to teach boys not to cry or show emotion, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

I've noticed the same sentiment in a lot of communities here on reddit. In some of what used to be my favorite subreddits, there are a lot of left-eimg people but even they are usually pro-life, anti-sex work, that type of thing.

Abortion is Murder...,"I do apologize for the misleading title, but I've lost count years ago as to how many times I’ve heard this soundbite. And there's a reason why it's repeated and over and over: 

* It's a straightforward argument with seemingly unambiguous language.
* It's emotionally impactful.
* It dignifies the ZEF by making its death as impactful as the murder of somebody who's already born.

On the surface, it appears valid--after all, it's the intentional killing of human life. However, after doing much research into the law and the morality of abortion, I have put together what I believe to be one of the most airtight arguments against this soundbite.

And here it is.

***

“Murder” is actually the colloquial term for the legal term “homicide,” and there are specific legal criteria for it to be legitimately called homicide. While there are minor variances in language depending on the Penal Code of the State you happen to live in, there are virtually universal and unambiguous criteria for homicide, and they can be summarized as follows:

**The premeditated, unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.**

Let’s compare the language of this sentence with the act of abortion.

*“Premeditated”*… Medical procedures are scheduled, so this is partially true. However, few (if any) people have sex with the intention to abort the fetus in the event of pregnancy.

*“Unlawful”*... The pregnant woman is legally allowed to make decisions about her body, including the decision to terminate a pregnancy. The courts have granted this power to women.

*“Killing”*… An abortion does end the life of the fetus, but context matters – otherwise, we would have to call any number of scenarios that involve killing somebody else “murder”, including justifiable self-defense and euthanasia of a patient who requested it.

“Human Being”… This is, without a doubt, the toughest part of the sentence to examine. What is a human being? Are fetuses human beings? And is it wrong to kill human beings just because they are human beings? From what I’ve researched over the years, there are two broad answers/definitions of what is a ""human being"":

1. Human beings are biologically human organisms.
2. Human beings are biologically human organisms who are conscious and sentient, with knowledge, feelings, memories, and other physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social characteristics.

Definition (2) makes it obvious that it’s morally indefensible to kill such an entity. Meanwhile, Definition (1) is too broad in its intended use since it can apply to anything that’s alive with human DNA, including appendixes, cancer cells, skin cells, even sperm, and it isn’t morally indefensible, let alone illegal, to masturbate, get cancer treatment, or remove one’s appendix.

Now, one might argue that a zygote is not like a skin cell because the zygote consists of a unique set of chromosomes that makes it a separate human being. However, with cloning via nuclear transfer, a single skin cell is enough to create a new human being. Although it would have the provider’s identical genetic code, it would still be a unique individual distinct from the provider. Why? Because human beings are much more than their genetic code, and this is consistent with Definition (2). As such, it’s more parsimonious to align with Definition (2) for what defines a human being. 

And that’s just from a biological standpoint. 

From a legal standpoint, the wide variety of laws throughout world history were written specifically to protect born human beings and their property. There is virtually no legal precedent for applying such laws to fetuses. There are rare and narrowly defined circumstances on the condition that the fetus has a subsequent live birth (e.g. allowing a fetus to later inherit so as to honor the intent of a deceased person, not to give a fetus personhood), but these instances are far too rare to apply broadly to the law. Furthermore, courts have found that modern prohibitions on abortion are of relatively recent introduction and thus lack the historical foundation which might have preserved them from constitutional review. Lastly, the law has defined instances where it is lawful to kill another human being. This includes self-defense, deterring another serious crime (e.g. rape, armed robbery, murder), Castle Doctrine, and execution (to name a few). These instances demonstrate that it isn’t enough that one be a human being in order for their killing to be called a homicide.

From both a biological and legal standpoint, it makes no sense to call a fetus a human being, let alone in the context of a homicide.

And finally…

*“Malice Aforethought”*… There are many emotions involved in abortion, and malice isn’t necessarily one of them. To assume that abortions are done firstly (or even strictly) out of malice is a fallacy.

***

TL;DR -- Abortion and murder are not synonymous with each other.

If you see any holes in this argument, please point them out -- I would love very much to see this argument have a significant impact on the usage of this soundbite, so that others may use this argument as well every time it comes up in the debate, because let's face it -- without this soundbite, the anti-abortion movement would lose one of its biggest footholds in the debate.",t2_1aazqg50,1626632382,prochoice

# What we can agree on

So I think most of the abortion debate doesn't revolve around if killing a person is wrong, but if a fetus is a person / is a life of value. (I hope I'm getting that right)

I think the  most popular arguments why a fetus is / ins't a person / life of value are:

It has the faculty of:  


1. Feeling pain / happiness (happiness=good=value)
2. Consciousness
3. Autonomy
4. Value for society

I agree that a fetus doesn't have all of these faculties or even any of them. I'll grant that.

# My Argument :

The present faculties if a fetus is a person / life of value do not matter, it's the **future faculties that matter.**

# Explanation:

The fetus (if not aborted) will possibly (normaly) have all of these faculties. It will live a long, possibly happy and meaningful life, be conscious, have autonomy and possibly be of value for society. I think we can all agree on that.

I think the main point of conflict will be if we should also care what a fetus will be when we talk about ""should we let it live or abort it"". If you still have doubts if we should really care what a fetus will be in the future see the following.

# Illustration:

Let's suppose that we have a 20yo women that is suffering from severe clinical depression. She cannot feel any sense of happiness (and thus her life has no value(because happiness=good=value)) and she is of no use for society because she is so apathetic that she can only stay in her house. We can all agree that there is a reasonable and plausible chance that she will become a normal person again that can experience happiness, pleasure and can be of use to society. 

Now, if I came along and decided (as her father) that because she is leeching of our family, consuming food  and ins't contributing to our family, that I would kill her, what would be wrong about doing that?

We can all agree that this does seem very wrong to do. After all **she could develop the faculty in the future** to feel happiness and be of use to society / the family. 

# Illustration 2:

Let's suppose that a 20yo man falls into a coma. He isn't conscious and isn't autonomous. We can all agree that there is a reasonable and plausible chance that he will become awake again somewhere in the future and be conscious and autonomous again.

Now, if I came along and decided (as his father) that because he is leeching off the healthcare system, isn't conscious or autonomous that we should pull the plug, what would be wrong about doing that?

We can all agree that this does seem very wrong to do. After all **he could regain the faculty in the future** to be conscious and be autonomous.

# Conclusions

If you think that we shouldn't kill the two people in Illustration 1 and 2, then you should conclude the same for the fetus if you want to be logically consistent. Why would the fetus be any differnent? What criteria do the 20yo's fulfil, that the fetus doesn't? I'd love to hear your suggestions in the comments!

# Possible Counter-Arguments

&gt;If a fetus shouldn't be aborted, because he's going to be a future person / life of value, then every menstruation is also murder and a man masturbating is genocide.

I understand where this argument is coming from, but there is a subtle difference between sperm or eggs to a fetus / fertilised egg. The difference is that a fertilised egg is going to be a person / life of value. The sperm or egg isn't going to be. The sperm or egg is just a cell and it will not become a person if you don't masturbate or if you magically don't have your period. 

Does this make sense? Let's talk about this in the comments!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Does this mean that IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) is also wrong because multiple fertilised eggs are destroyed?

Yes, if we want the best for people's wellbeing, we should try to only fertilise one egg at a time and not dispose of the other eggs, because they could become future persons / lives of value.

I'm selfishly pro-choice and proud of it,"A few days ago, a co-worker was complaining about a recent pro-choice protest. She was pretty surprised when I expressed my agreement with the protest. Maybe it would have been wiser to hold my tongue but I didn't, so of course she pushed back with all the usual ""it's killing a baby"" and so on. Luckily, the argument was short enough to only be annoying rather than infuriating, but what stuck with me about this particular exchange was something I said. I'd said firmly, with a lot more conviction and confidence than I might have expected, ""If I got pregnant, I would get an abortion immediately, without a second thought."" And maybe that's not such a strange thing, but it finally struck me: I have countless reasons to be pro-choice. But one reason is stronger than the others, and it's how badly I want that option. I'm probably at the least risk possible of becoming pregnant that a person with a functioning uterus can be. Fuck. That. Shit. Forced birthers could shoot down every single other argument in support of safe, legal abortions (when pigs fly, right?) and I would not be swayed. Even if somehow it was morally wrong, or murder, or whatever, I don't give a flying fuck. I would rather be a monster than pregnant. Is it selfish? Sure. I don't even care if it's selfish. I may be exaggerating a bit, but the point is I want to be able to get an abortion if I ever need one, and every rollback on abortion rights everywhere in the world feels like a personal attack against the hypothetical pregnant version of myself.",t2_4di9dnj3,1626483832,prochoice
Woman aborts wanted child without telling fiancé,"I recently interacted with a man on another sub where his fiancée initiated the discussion about getting pregnant and then she did.  She changed her mind and got an abortion without telling him.  It destroyed him and lead to trust issues and ended the relationship.  And he hates when people say her body her choice to him because they’re in a relationship and it’s his choice too.  In a functional relationship, yes she probably should have informed him but he complained she did it without his consent.

I got downvoted when I pointed out that this is just his side of the situation.  We don’t know what their relationship is like.  She obviously didn’t see him as a source of support or comfort that she didn’t go to him, her life partner about this abortion.  That is worrying.  We don’t know why she didn’t, but that’s a sign of lack of trust and communication that was already there on her side while he said the trust issues developed later.  We don’t know if this man is abusive or would have coerced her into keeping a pregnancy she changed her mind and didn’t want.  He avoided the question when I asked if he would have coerced her into keeping a pregnancy she didn’t want.  I don’t know what he would say if she did actually go to him and say she didn’t want the pregnancy and he did.  Would he have said no?  She was probably concerned about his reaction too.

I said I wouldn’t want to have a child and be tied to a man that I don’t think I could trust nor support which she evidently doesn’t.  His comments were deeply worrying.  

Her not telling him was not a sign of disrespect but a sign of concern, lack of support, communication and possibly fear.  She definitely had a damn good reason.

Prolife devalue women to give “objective” value to a fetus,"My good friend u/STThornton wrote something that illustrated this point very well:

*I guess if you remove all empathy, you can assign some sort of value to humans and their lives as if they were objects. At that point, it becomes a matter of two boxes sitting on a shelf, and one doesn't have the right to knock the other off the shelf and shatter it just because it's inconvenient for the first box to have the second box sitting there. They both have equal value.*

*Nevermind the fact that one is a breathing, feeling, aware, life sustaining human organism and the other isn't. Reality or empathy do not matter. Their life experiences, their hopes, their dreams, their physical, mental, and emotional well-being, their quality of life - none of that matters.+

*You decided that they have no more ""value"" than some partially developed, non breathing, non feeling, non aware, non life sustaining human body that doesn't experience anything. And as such, they can endure whatever horror, and it's just fine. None of it matters.*

And I think this is key to the prochoice argument against a prolife view of humanity.  Seeing every human life as a 1 or a 0, and the name of the game is to *never* turn a 1 to a 0 (of course, war, the death penalty, homelessness, and lack of available health care don’t count. And god forbid you being up the mandatory kidney donation argument). 

Almost everyone agrees that life should be viewed qualitatively and not quantitatively. There is no “objectivity” to life. Sure, death is pretty objective, but to value all life as the same as long as the person isn’t dead is ridiculous. 

Ultimately, life is what you make of it, and I think if someone is obligated to be in your care specifically, and cannot voice what life means to them, *which only occurs during pregnancy,* it should be the caretaker’s ability to put that value on said life. To say otherwise is to devalue that caretaker, because it’s their life just as much, if not more so, than the life of the person they are caring for. 

I live with my mom and grandparents, and my grandfather is extremely disabled. My grandma, my mom, and myself shoulder the burden of taking care of him together, and when we can’t, we hire aids to do so. He would be way too much of a burden for any of us to care for on our own, especially while trying to hold down a job and, y’know, have a life. If the government body came out and said that only my grandmother was allowed to take care of him for some arbitrary reason (let’s say it’s because she married him), it would be impossible for her to do. We would all support having him die as painlessly as possible in order for my grandma to preserve her quality of life. 

(Also, if Thornton would like me to take this down due to using their words, I’m fine with that. But I think they made a good enough point that I really wanted to talk about it)",t2_mz5ef,1626444107,prochoice

Do you guys care about ZEF's?,"Recently a prolifer told me I don't care about fetuses and honestly I think they may be.... right?

It's not that I care *more* about the pregnant person It's that I *only* care about the pregnant person. It's not some magical fairytale blessing to be pregnant It's a serious thing. I don't see the ZEF as an ""innocent precious angel"" I see it as what it is. 

I can't emphasize with a fetus nor can I feel any sympathy for it. I can see why a mother and her family would value a zef or a baby and I would do it too but I don't see why litreally anybody else would care to the extent that prolifers claim they do. 

I just want to make it clear that I don't hate ZEFS they just really aren't at all a priority when it comes to anything else. It's not my ZEF, and it's not my body I don't see any reason why I should care about them if the mother doesn't.


So I want opinions and honest answers, do you guys truly care about ZEF's?

"So super duper sick of antis claiming artificial wombs will ""make it so there's no need for abortion"".","Keep seeing antis claim ""if we had artificial wombs no one would EVER need abortion ever again!!!"" 

Like what. The. Literal. Fuck. 

Sorry not sorry the goverment isn't taking anything out of my body and keeping it, let alone a fetus that could show up on my door step in 18 years. If someone wants tl give a child up for adoption they don't need a artificial womb. 

Secondly who gets to use them? Only people who'd otherwise get abortions? What if a family like the Duggars wanted to use them? Who pays for their 19 and counting artifical womb bills? Do you ever get parental rights to the child if you use one or are the automatically given up permanently after they leave your body? Would their be a limit on how many babies you could use an artificial womb with? 

Nevermind the fact that born ass babies with clearly identifying features are switched ALL THE TIME already no way it wouldnt happen with artificial wombs. 

These people claim to want small government yet want to force their religion on everyone and Pregnancy on those who are capable of it (some even go so far to say you're useless if you don't have children when able). How do they NOT see that the government having not just access but FORCED access to literally be able to *steal our DNA* is BAD?!? 

Who's to say they wouldn't use artifical wombs to make designer babies? 

And again whos going to pay? Only rich people unless they support funding, which it helps poor people so i doubt theyd do. 

Then there's just this *one* little issue.... Things go wrong with pregnancies!!! Not everyone would choose or perhaps even have the choice of using one and many people would still have to carry to term using their own bodies. Some of those may be able to be transferred in some way to an artifical womb but missed misscarriages will still very much require an abortion and miscarriages aka *spontaneous abortions* will more than likely *always happen*. 

I am so sick and tired of them saying all this bullshit about so many different things they have 0 knowledge on. They come up with these very basic and in theory okay sounding idea that is quickly shown to be a fucking mess. There are so many questions they absolutely refuse to answer.

Pro-life position is actually very selfish,"They think only about what they want and their never ending desire to ban abortions (control fantasies).

Despite banning abortions being largely inneffective.
Banning abortion doesn't make women suddenly want a pregnancy they REALLY don't want.
Women will just do it anyway.

In which case the pro-lifer has anti-social/psychopathix punishment fantasies of how women should be punished for exersizing their own rights of their bodies, organs and blood. Or how women should be prevented from aborting, ie often by forced institutionalization/kidnapping and imprisonment. Which in itself is a fantasy of dominating and controlling women.

They often would prefer if the woman dies from unsafe abortions instead of living. Which is the epitome of selfish. Prefering someone die just to satisfy your own feelings of anger and resentment.

Pro-lifers see themselves as superior morally to pro-choicers. They think of themselves as ultruists but they aren't the ones that will be suffering from the laws they wish to implement.
This is false altruism.
Ultruism is an individual choice to sacrifice for others. However if this person is forcing others to self-sacrifice this is false ultruism.

Pro-lifers also don't have anything they can personally lose by failing to succeed. They won't suffer by failing.
So it is easy to advocate for if you personally won't be 'punished' or 'suffer' if you fail.

However pro-choicers have a lot more to lose if they fail to suceed. We could lose rights over our own bodies and organs and be forced to gestate. As well as being institutionalized or persecuted/jailed.

I’m tired of prolife people weaponizing fetuses against women,"Sometimes arguing with them is fun, but at other times, they just put up a wall. 

“A fetus is a life and we shouldn’t kill them.”

“Well, what if they weren’t a life, and killing them if the mother desires is just fine?”

Cue arguing about what is “a life,” and why fetuses are special. That is, if they don’t call you names and cuss you out first. 

We could talk about all the real pain and suffering that forced pregnancy causes, focus on the woman, focus on society at large, but none of it matters to prolifers as long as a fetus “isn’t killed” (since they don’t even seem to care about “natural miscarriage” much). 

And what makes me even more mad is anticipating their fucking idiotic responses as if they have the moral high ground. “Wow, you’re complaining about not being able to kill children? Poor you.” 

What will it take to get it into your heads and the heads of people in power that **fetuses aren’t children???? They’re not people??? And they cause harm that should not be mandatory to experience if you have sex and mess up???**

Then you get into the “the whore should have closed her legs” arguments, as if recreational sex is a sin and you gotta experience pregnancy as a punishment. 
“It’s not a punishment, it’s natural!” It’s natural, but it sure as hell isn’t *good.* Pregnancy is neutral at best, and humanity has moved past being a slave to nature. We can welcome it into our bodies or rid ourselves of it. We tend to our bodies like a garden, removing weeds and nurturing what we want. Sometimes a fetus is a weed. Get over it. 

It’s very hard not to see the prolife movement as not being out to get women. Sure, some people like being “traditional,” and that’s fine. But if they stopped at their personal preference, they’d be prochoice. For whatever reason, they can’t leave others alone. They have to make moral judgements on others’ actions. Actions that are completely ethical and do not cause suffering. “Fetuses are special and need to be protected.” No, you are entitled and think that people should do what you say because otherwise you feel mentally uncomfortable and refuse to grow as a person. That’s the only suffering you would have to endure. Yet you expect women to go through far worse. 

My apologies. I’m usually much more tempered and logical than this, but I’m tired of dancing around my views to try to get theirs to budge when they refuse to change their mind.

Abortion is self defense!,"First off the womb is private property like my house, car and even country are.  I can evict tenants from my house, shoot carjackers and America as a sovereign country has the right to decide who to let in and who to refuse entry to or deport.  There’s no reason then why a woman shouldn’t be able to have this ability with her own body.  This is America not 1980s communist Romania where all property is commonly owned, therefore the fetus is simply a tenant.  Since no tenancy was agreed to, the fetus is simply tolerated.  That toleration can be revoked at any time.  

On top of that, fetuses kill 300,000 women a year, and severely injure thousands more.  Pregnancy can be a debilitating event to one’s health.  But you know what also can be? Getting carjacked.  In many states you’re allowed to use deadly force when you’re being threatened with great bodily harm or death, and some with stand your ground laws there’s no duty to retreat.   Shooting a carjacker is perfectly legal because you’re defending yourself and your property.  There’s no reason castle doctrine shouldn’t apply to the womb.

Fetuses also take your nutrients in the course of their development, even at the expensive of your own health.  Coercive taking of someone else’s property is called robbery.  In my state you’re allowed to use deadly force to stop the commission of a violent crime, robbery included on that list.

He came to Ohio and became buddies with my town's leadership. He got the local pro-life groups on his side. With their help, he is now trying to spread the ban to neighboring cities. 

Their strategy is to use a cookie cutter ordinance, it's language is carefully worded to avoid lawsuits. He will discuss it privately with a city's leadership and you won't have a lot of notice before they make a decision on it. Lebanon residents found out 3 days before our council voted.

If you live somewhere where a ban could be a possibility, please keep an eye on this man and where he is spreading his ban.

"Abortion isn't a punishment for the Z/E/F, and here's why","ZEF = zygote, embryo, or fetus.  
Forced-birthers like to make emotive appeals such as, ""Abortion is the death penalty for innocent children,"" and regarding rape pregnancy, ""Why should the baby die for its father's crimes?""

Firstly, no matter how a pregnancy conceived, abortion is healthcare for women with unwanted pregnancies (not getting into health complications that threaten women's lives more than usual, or the fetus having a condition). A few minutes of research can tell you about some of the dangers pregnancy inflicts, including septic and fatal infection, hemorrhage, a weakened heart, damage to the back, and so on. Furthermore, as we know from the life-changing trauma of rape, compelled use of a living human's body causes that person extreme psychological suffering, to the point of its being a human rights violation to inflict. So, no one is ""executing"" the pregnancy out of nowhere. Abortion is justified by pregnancy's inherent nature of using human bodies.

Secondly, for abortion to be a punishment, a crime would need to have been deliberately committed. What happens when a perpetrator isn't killed upon committing the act? They get arrested, charged, and punished with prison or something else (although if anyone intentionally did to a human being the equivalent of what ZEFs do to women forced to give birth to them, they had BETTER get locked up for life). 

Now, what happens to the baby when a pregnancy ends with a live birth? Nothing. They get taken care of, they either stay with the mother or get adopted. No charges, no arrest, obviously because they did nothing deliberately and punishing them would be ridiculous--not to mention if ZEFs were criminals, people could still be arrested at any point in their lives, particularly if the mother died giving birth.

Abortion is not a punishment for anyone any more than any other healthcare is. It is about protecting women from the physical and psychological harm caused by forced use of their bodies. That is all. If babies are born, we pro-choicers have nothing but good wishes for them--including that they will have the inherent human rights and dignity of being allowed to own and control their bodies.

I hope it makes sense now why the claim of abortion being a punishment isn't based in fact, but is a tactic of emotional manipulation.",t2_89mlri23,1626229864,prochoice

Debate with my Pro-Life Dad,"As a pro-choice guy in a family that has a lot of conservatives we don't talk about certain matters very much.

But he and my mom were not so nicely talking to one of my sisters for being rather physical with her boyfriend (no sex as far as I'm aware, just heavy kissing and such).

They were badgering her about 'respecting' herself and that she lives under their roof. So I confronted my mom on it first and she largely avoided talking about it while defending what they said.

Then he came into my room and we had a long and a not exactly open discussion. There wasn't any screaming or cussing, mind you, but we didn't exactly agree. A major part of his argument was that 'respectful people' wait and don't make 'wrong' choices regarding their bodies.

He said if she got pregnant her life would be over and that she couldn't take care of the baby. I said abortion is an option, then he did the common 'innocent child' bit repeatedly. Going from a scientific point didn't convince him as he said he studied biology in school (even though that's not what he wanted to be in his life's focus).

So I tried explaining the risks of pregnancy and what has happened to some women. He then said 'than they shouldn't have been doing it' part. Saying sex shouldn't have that as a 'punishment' or even be what it's intended for. I said someone shouldn't be ashamed of their desires and that they have the right to act on them.

He asked me how I could kill you know. He then tried talking to me if I got a lady pregnant or if I was in his position. I said that the lady shouldn't be ashamed of and/or repress her desires, that she should be safe (ex. have birth control), and if it came to it abortion is an option. He was bewildered and said that's not he and my mom raised me.

Eventually said I wasn't going to win the argument. That it's their house and rules. Eventually he walked away saying it's what he believes and asked how I could believe what I believe. I just said I value the woman in the situation more. It ended on an even more sour note as if she had an abortion he wouldn't be there to support her.

(I don't like talking bad about my folks...but some things I feel need to be shared. I'm not perfect or some paragon. I have said some bad things in the past about girls/women and once I realized what I said/did I've hated myself ever since. My sister shouldn't feel ashamed to have her desires and to act on them. If she wants intimacy, she has every right to it. I just don't want her to feel like what they say is absolute. She doesn't talk to us about it, obviously understandable why. But I kept getting so frustrated and horrified by some of the things he said. I don't want to talk bad about him...he's had to deal with a lot in his life too...but it didn't feel right not saying anything about what they said to her...even though it didn't amount to anything.)",t2_5cn664qq,1626194773,prochoice

I'm pro-choice but I also think life begins at conception.,"Hear me out. In the argument between pro-life and pro-choice, it always **seems** to come down to this. Where does life begin? Is the fetus alive/ a person? I think it is. But I also support killing it. Sounds quite harsh, I know.

I don't think we pro-choicers necessarily think life doesn't begin at conception. It's just something we tell ourselves and others to justify our position. I mean, if NASA discovers micro-organisms on Mars tomorrow, would pro-choicers argue that it's 'just a clump of cells'? I think not.

I believe it all comes down to the need of the mother to live a happier life. Yes, it sounds selfish but we have to face the reality. Think about it... if (by some miracle of science) fetuses were able to be transferred to the wombs of women who cannot get pregnant, minutes/hours after conception, if unwanted by the original mother, I don't think many people would claim it's not a life. I think most women would argue that it's basically a life, hence they should be paid accordingly. Or imagine if pregnancies only lasted one week instead of 40, and childbirth was as painless as taking a dump, **and** your baby will be adopted right away by a couple who cannot conceive... would you still be so inclined to claim life does not begin at birth?

It's our need to appear 'right' that makes us go around in circles trying to 'justify' abortion. It makes us say things that we don't really believe in (once I heard someone comparing a pregnancy to a tumor). And I think that need is quite natural. 'Killing this person now is more convenient for me than going through pregnancy' is not going to make you look good in an argument. So you need to appeal to different policies (that makes us look stupid and evil to pro-lifers like Ben Shapiro) to feel less guilty about it.

Not alive until born — So it's okay to kill a baby a few minutes/hours before it's born? Ugh, sounds cruel.

Not alive until first breath — What about babies who cannot breathe for days after being born, okay to kill them? Of course, no pro-choicer would say yes.

Not alive unless conscious — What about people who are asleep or in comas, okay to kill them? Again, no one would say yes to this, unless they were a murderous psychopath.

Not alive because cannot feel pain — What about people who suffer from CIPA (a disease that makes a person unable to feel pain), okay to kill them? Again, obviously no.

I think these are all irrelevant arguments that we use (and didn't even think about when we became pro-choice if we are being honest) to mask our fundamental motive behind it, which is to live a happy life, which is ultimately the greatest desire of all humans.

Of course, I too justify supporting abortion to **my own conscience**, like we all do, for everything we do. Here's how I see it.

If I was forced to choose between killing a Labrador puppy and killing a mosquito, I would definitely kill the mosquito, as I assume would anyone else. Now, why did I value the life of the puppy over that of the mosquito? Because it looked cuter? Yes! Now, is that **right**? Was it the fault of the mosquito that it didn't look as cute as the puppy? Is this a **good/moral/ethical** basis to determine the value of a life? Definitely not. Because then I would be saying the uglier a person is, the more they deserve to die, which sounds down right horrible.

But, the real reason I chose to save the puppy was because it made me feel **less guilty.** And that's how all humans make all of life's decisions. We choose to make decisions that make us feel less guilty based on our perceptions (a blind and deaf person who recently got attacked by a Labrador might perceive the cuteness of the puppy somewhat lesser than I do).

Now, the choice between a mosquito and a puppy is quite obvious (sorry, mosquitoes). Let's try different examples on the spectrum of animals based on how they make us feel. The size of the animal seems to be quite proportional to how guilty we feel for killing them so I'll start from the extreme ends and meet in the middle.

Elephant vs ant → Kill ant, save elephant

Moose vs wasp → Kill cockroach, save moose

Dog vs cockroach → Kill cockroach, save dog 

Rat vs hamster → Kill rat, save hamster (?)

As you can see, thinks become less obvious and more dubious when you reach the middle.

(Keep in mind, there are more factors that contribute to our decisions than body size. For an example, I think a scientist would be okay with killing a puppy to save a prehistoric mosquito trapped in amber whose DNA could be used to create dinosaurs.)

This brings us to the issue at hand, abortion.

A woman's right to decide whether she wants to have a baby or not, even after conception, which will ultimately decide the quality of her whole life **vs** a small embryo containing human life in its most fundamental state → Kill the embryo, save the woman's right to choose

However, just like the rat vs hamster, this is not as clear-cut as mosquito vs puppy. Based on the meanings people give to the components in a pregnancy, which are influenced by their personal experience and beliefs, they can decide either way.

It's all about how we guilty we feel about something.

Here's another example about how guilt controls behavior. I can never strangle a baby chick to death or even kill a full grown chicken in a 'humane' way that is done in farms. Yet, I eat meat. Everyday.

Now, would I still eat meat if I had to choose the chicken myself and had to witness it getting killed? Probably not. Definitely much less. One of the main reasons I eat meat (other than it being delicious) is because it's conveniently killed by someone else and available to be bought in the shop without having to suffer a horrific experience.

Does that make me a **moral/ethical/right** person? I don't know. I like to think so, but I wouldn't be shocked if someone disagrees.

If someone I know decides to get an abortion, I would support them and help them get it done safely, as I have done in the past, because I would feel more guilty about talking her into keeping the pregnancy and witnessing her struggle to raise that child, than I would about helping her abort it.

However, just like eating meat, I can't **justify** abortion in a way that makes it look objectively moral/ethical... I can't prove it's **right.** As a matter of fact, I believe morals and ethics are subjective.

I would love to know others' opinion regarding this.",t2_1yf32sks,1626178258,prochoice

"Where is self-abortion illegal, and how harsh are penalties for breaking abortion law in countries where it's illegal?","Trying to get a broad understanding of the global status of legal penalties under abortion bans and had wondered if people on here might know of some detailed resources that I might have missed. Specifically, I wanted to know how harsh the penalties for breaking the laws are, rather than the somewhat easier question of abortion legality; I'm trying to get as detailed an understanding as possible. Just to give a general idea of what I'm thinking of, something like [https://maps.reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws](https://maps.reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws) but that gives a summary of the legal penalties rather than the grounds for abortion would be the sort of thing I'm looking for.

Specifically, I'm trying to understand the situation internationally in terms of how strict laws are for performing an abortion, and much moreso, how many places directly criminalise people for having them. I'd be particularly interested to know if there's anywhere that on paper executes people for having them and particuarly if there's anywhere which does it in practice, same for life in prison (and horrified if this is the case).  

If anybody has some hard data on numbers of convictions and the like as well, I'd also be interested in those. Just for the sake of confusion and to illustrate some of the subtlties that I want to get my head around, the UK (outside of Northern Ireland\*) while very much a pro-choice country strictly speaking has abortion illegal despite being state-funded and free, since the Abortion Act 1967 functions via creating a de facto very large exception to a previous law that made it a criminal offense, curiously self abortions weren't legal up until some changes during the pandemic to allow them at home (though outside of Northern Ireland, I'm not aware of a single recent case of any woman in the UK having been criminalised for self abortion, as no prosecutor would view it as in the public interest to do so). I therefore don't expect neat overlap internationally between abortion being broadly legal in some form and self-abortions being legal due to this sort of thing; presumably there will also be places that ban it but make exceptions for self-abortions. Non-English articles/data sources are fine btw, am happy to use Google translate on them!

\*Northern Ireland has a different legal framework to the rest of the UK- it was up until quite recently exempt from the abortion act 1967, but the original bit of legislation which bans it now no longer aplies and it has abortion on demand up until 28 weeks (access is a bit patchy from what I've read).",t2_b88he8bj,1626107487,prochoice

Another reason why abortion is sometimes the best option for women and AFAB ppl. A scenario...,"Let's say you have a woman. She's nice but she's not sexually active right now. She hasn't had sex for years. She's not asexual and does like sex but he just hasn't found someone she wants to have sex with right now.

One day while at a bar she meets someone and she really likes him. That same night she has sex with him. They had a few drinks but they're not intoxicated. They're just a little loose. No one was coerced and everything was fine.

The condom they use broke and she's pregnant. She didn't get an abortion and now she has a child. She doesn't want to give the child up for adoption. The father also wants the child. She doesn't know him very well and she doesn't know if he will be a good parent. The biological father wants the child and so they decide to split the custody.

So what? Now if she have to stay near him all the time? She's in Boston and wants to move to Las vegas. Does he have to go to Las Vegas too? They're not romantically interested in each other. Only sexually.

do you see how much of a problem this is? It creates so much complication for people unnecessarily. You could say you could just give the child up for adoption but what if the father doesn't want his child to go up for adoption? And what if you as the mother do not want the father to have the kid?

Story Time,"When I found out I was pregnant, I was 30 years old, single, broke, in a job I hated (and didn't want to be stuck in), and didn't know who the father of the pregnancy was. 

I was depressed and reckless. I was making only the poorest of choices and friends weren't as available to me as I needed them to be (selfish, I know) so I turned to online dating. I was happy to just get some attention (any attention) to fill the void that was left inside me where my happiness used to live. 

I wasn't even able to afford to get a pregnancy test for over 2 weeks after I started to worry about my period being late. I lived alone and had pushed away the people who actually cared in preference to the shiny new people who pretended to care. I was not OK. I was breaking down slowly. I found my rock bottom. 

I finally did the test, thinking (hoping) it would be negative because I'd been told for many years that I'd be unlikely to be able to conceive naturally. The little blue plus appeared. My world shattered. Where I lived at the time was still in the process of legalising abortion and it was still very difficult to get advice; my own doctor even tried to shame me into keeping the pregnancy and putting the kid up for adoption. I knew deep down that I couldn't remain pregnant. I just couldn't do it. 

I made the choice to abort. It was my decision. What solidified it for me was two main factors:

1)	I'm very close with my dad and I couldn't comprehend answering the inevitable ""where's my daddy?"" question

2)	My friend who is against abortion was very supportive. She told me, ""none of these people who say they'll support you are going to be there at 3am when the kid is screaming and you have to work tomorrow"".

How I changed my stance on Pro-Choice,"I have always been pro-choice. I came across a delema that I didn't know how to handle and it make me question if I should be pro-choice. The issue is weather it is OK for people to risk bringing people into the world knowing they were going to let it die anyways. This is like a witch casting spells but she knows that there is a chance that a spell could summon a baby vampire that would need to feed off of her to survive. Basically it it ok for us as adults to preform actions that will bring forth life but we know we will not care for it.  I turned to this community for answers. To be completely honest, I got horrorable answers and people's answers pushed me to be in the center because of how...well...dumb they were and how unconvincing they were. Some people told me that unlike casting spells, sex was nessisary. No it isnt. It is highly wanted. There were a few others that made me question the intelligence of the community and eve my own.

Here was my flaw: this whole time I never talked about the fetus because I felt that it was not the strongest part of the argument. Once I felt that the other argument I had no longer worked, this was my last leg. But then I came to see the fault in my sinareo. It is not just possibly bringing life into the world, but the value of that life relative to everything. It is not summoning a vampire to feed off of me, but a single cell. The fetus's life has less value than the bodily autonomy of a person. This does not address the issues of late term adoration,  because I feel that the fetus gains value as it progresses.",t2_b5aiz6u3,1625688224,prochoice
I was a Sister of Angels,"**TL;DR My mother had two abortions before I was born. Trauma, loneliness, and shame about sex caused me to idolize my ""siblings"" and be virulently pro-life when I was 14/15.**

This isn't an ex-prolifer story so much as it is a trauma story involving abortion, but I feel compelled to share this. I originally typed this document up for my therapist, but have taken some stuff out. Even so, this story is really, really, *really* long. If you don't want to read my life story, press the back button. If you do, thank you for taking the time. I really appreciate it.

I was a ""Sister of Angels"". My mom had two abortions. 5 and 12 years before me. She told me when I was 8 years old- way too early. She had no boundaries. She had a brain tumor.

I was 14 years old when I saw gory photos of ""late term abortions"" while trying to do a school project on fetal development. I didn't know they were actually stillbirths, and believed this is what the average abortion looked like. I thought this is what my siblings (both about 8 weeks) had looked like. I thought fetuses at the same point of gestation as I had been at birth (about 28 weeks) were routinely aborted.

I was already anti-sex. Blame my grandmother. Or my mother. Or the suburbanites I was surrounded by for the first 11 years of my life. For whatever reason, I was weirdly prudish for not having religious parents. Not that religion wasn't a factor- I was raised *adjacent* to the church and was incredibly susceptible to the most toxic parts of its message. It's no wonder that I picked up on the sex-shaming aspects of religion too, having read in a book of devotions my grandmother gave me that having sexual *thoughts* outside marriage was a violation of the Seventh Commandment. I was so ashamed of anything remotely sexual that, when I went to the beach, I would keep my clothes on for as long as possible because I didn't want my parents to think I was enjoying being partially dressed ""like a stripper"".

This led to *interesting* interactions with my mother, who, as I said, had no boundaries. Her abortions weren’t the only thing she told me about too early. I know she lost her virginity when she was 12. She was hell-bent on ruining my childhood innocence, sexualizing everything from my favorite songs to my little “crushes” on boys at school. At the time, I thought that it was my fault- she sexualized everything because she thought that I was a sexual (and therefore bad) person. I went to the opposite extreme, at one point trying to convince her (and myself) that I was on the asexuality spectrum, I thought that if I successfully convinced her that I was as pure as the driven snow, she would stop. What I didn't realize was that convincing her of this was impossible, because when she looked at me, she didn't see me- she saw herself.

As for my grandmother, she had the same ideas of sexual purity that I did, approaching life and love with a fairytale-like worldview that I inherited from her. In her personal life, she claimed that she'd waited until marriage to have sex, and she never dated again after her husband died when she was only 45. She and I had a special relationship, because she’d lost her only daughter when I was 2. My aunt had been a pregnant teen in the days before abortion was legal, and gave two babies up for adoption. She was never the same after that, becoming obese and dying of a heart attack at 50. I was 11 when my family foreclosed on our house and moved in with my grandmother; it was only then that I saw her ugly side, when she began using her daughter's short life as a scare tactic on me- don't eat that, cover up, you're lazy and vain. Still, the fairytale-like worldview she had given me was sweet opium- even though my present life was sucked, I believed that I was the princess in my own fairytale, and one day I would get my “happily ever after”. This “happily ever after” took different forms over the years- at 14, it was a movie-worthy high school experience, to make up for my middle school experience of  bullying and rejection. This delusion, in its different forms, would act as an emotional opioid for the first two decades of my life, and it was tied up with my grandmother- although I wouldn’t realize this until both of them were gone.

I took my anti-abortion views to school. I was shouted down. I told my best friend that I was a ""Sister of Angels""- the first, but certainly not the last, time I'd ever told anyone that. She was supportive- or at least pretended to be. One week later, she told me she was pregnant. I, of course, reacted poorly. She said that she’d had sex because family problems had made her upset and confused. Upset and confused? My mother’s tumor had returned. She was getting worse every day. *I* was upset and confused. My friend said she was considering an abortion, and I was determined to stop her at all costs. One day we fought about it and she stormed off, leaving me crying in a drugstore. I was struck by the unfairness of the fact that *she* was pregnant, and *I* was the one crying about it. I searched ""pro-life videos"" on YouTube for the first time that day. I didn’t see her for a few days after that, and when I did, she acted as if nothing had ever happened. The next week, our final week of middle school, my other best friend told me the whole thing was a ruse. She was never pregnant. It was a sick test, and I had failed.

I hadn't had my period in 3 months at that point. I went to the doctor, who made me take a pregnancy test. Of course, I was a virgin. Even so, it was a humiliating, shame-ridden experience.  I decided I never wanted to see a pregnancy test again until I wanted a child. So I took a pledge to myself that I would never have sex until I was married. I wish I had known then that my social isolation and low self-esteem were the only chastity vow I would need.

I lost at least the next year of my life to being a ""Sister of Angels"". I read anti-abortion blogs. I watched anti-abortion videos. I made tribute after tribute to my older siblings- named them, wrote poems about them, bought two angel pins meant to represent them. It was a compulsion. I wanted to stop. Many times, I wiped my search history of any mention of abortion, as though that would make me forget. But I would always come back. I would talk about it to anyone who would listen. I thought that if I kept talking, I would eventually say something that made sense. High school started out with a world of opportunity, but gradually started to become just as anxiety-ridden and lonely as middle school had been. I kept searching for closure- an end to the story, after which I could move on with my life and achieve my happily ever after. But there was none.

My mom died at the end of that year. One of the first things I said after getting the news was, “she died thinking I hated her”. Two weeks later, my fundamentalist Christian cousin took me to an event for ""women's organizations"", including a crisis center meant to turn women with unwanted pregnancies away from abortion. I asked her if she thought women who had abortions went to Hell, and she said that those who repented were saved. My mother had not ""repented"". I could not accept that answer, so I shut down. Was I pro-life? Was I pro-choice? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I was full of guilt.

Trump was elected the year after that. I, like so many others, was terrified. 14-year-old me might get her wish to see abortion made illegal- potentially at the expense of an older me. I started to look into IUDs, even though I was still the virginest virgin that ever virgined. At this point, my peers were starting to have sex, and I started to resent my virginity even as I clung to it. I knew I was missing out, but fear- fear that my attempts to change things would fail, or that they would *succeed* and I would end up like my mother or my aunt- kept me stuck where I was. As high school had become a hell of my own creation, my “happily ever after” became the quintessential college experience. I focused on getting into a good college, believing that there, I would be free from all the limitations of the present and could do what I *really* wanted- even though I wasn’t even sure what I wanted.

The year after that, my uncle took me on a college tour. While we were waiting for our flight, he showed me an article about college hookup culture and impressed upon me that getting pregnant would ruin my life. It was then that I realized that he, like my mother when she was alive, could not see me- both only saw her, and no amount of me pretending to be “pure” would change that. Then what the hell had I *gone* through all that for? I asked myself that question into my senior year, when all anyone could talk about was all the parties I hadn't been invited to and all the sex I hadn't been having. I resented everyone who had done this to me- including my siblings, 30 year old piles of biowaste that they were. Now I was left holding a ton of baggage that I didn't want, with no way to put it down. That was, until I got to college. I got into my dream school and believed that the “happily ever after” I had been waiting for was finally here. There, I would be able to do what I *really* wanted- even though I still wasn’t sure what I wanted.

I went to college the year after that- angry, desperate, and prepared to do a complete 180. What I had failed to take into account was that I was taking all of my issues with me. College party culture puts all of one’s insecurities under a microscope, and I wasn’t the slightest bit equipped to deal with that. I felt like the most hideous woman alive when no opportunities to hook up arose in my first weeks on campus. When guys *did* start to hit on me at parties later in the year, my mouth said yes even though my intuition said no. I was frustrated, reckless, and literally all I could think about was my mother. It's hard to overstate how omnipresent she, and my siblings, were in my mind. Her first abortion was when she was a freshman in college, right before she dropped out. That story existed in every failed midterm, every guy that felt me up in a frat house basement. I found two ""best friends"" who were almost as mentally ill as I was. One of them, like my mother, had absolutely no sexual boundaries; like my mother, he was entitled, had no respect for the word no, and was prone to fly into a rage if his ego was wounded. As time went on, he got more inappropriate and she got more like him, but to me the constant boundary-pushing and emotional abuse felt like a mother's love. I was trapped by cognitive dissonance and mental illness, *still* having no idea what I wanted- I once nearly lost my virginity to a random guy at a party and had a moral crisis about it for months. Just as stuck as I was in high school, I watched helplessly as I became a person that I didn’t like.

Things fell apart the year after that. I was on academic probation and had been discarded by my “friends”, made out to be the exact kind of toxic person that he was. My probation semester, like most of my life before it, was lonely and anxiety-ridden, but I had a new “happily ever after”- once I got off of academic probation, I would be able to rush a sorority, and I would have a social life again. I got off probation and turned 20, but the sweet opium of a happily ever after was starting to wear off. I cried the night before I returned to campus, not wanting to go back. Still, I rushed that sorority I had set all my hopes on, only to be rejected. I checked into the campus counseling center the next day and within one month was working with a trauma-informed therapist.

It was then that I began to learn. I learned that I was not uniquely broken, but that my previously inexplicable ""brokenness"" was the result of years of generational trauma. I learned that my ""brokenness"" had a name, in fact, multiple names- C-PTSD, ADHD, GAD, SAD, OCD. I learned that my grandmother, my mother, and my former best friend were narcissists. I learned that showing your 9 year old your sexual instruments is a kind of child abuse called ""covert incest"". And I learned why I'd taken up the mantle of being a ""Sister of Angels'' all those years ago- I'd really meant ""Sister of a Living, Breathing Abused Autistic Boy"". My little brother had been diagnosed at 3, and our mother had refused to accept it. Once she had, she'd resented him for it. One day, shortly before the tumor was discovered, she'd told me in a state of delusion that she and my dad were separating- she would get custody of me and my dad would get custody of my brother. My brain repressed those painful memories. I did not unveil them until I began treating my C-PTSD. At 14, all I had were the emotions. I wanted to protect him, and I wanted someone to protect me, so I “protected” the clumps of cells that would have grown up to protect us.

Pro-life would make sense in a perfect world. Where rape and abuse never happen. Where everyone has access to gainful employment and childcare. Where many of these aborted fetuses would not have been born just to be dead children. At 14, I already knew I did not live in a perfect world. I knew that every time I had to step over my mother's crumpled form and rush out the door to a school where the sight of my ""friends"" made me want to throw up from fear. But I remained in denial, believing that if I just wished hard enough, I would get my happily ever after.

2020 took away my delusion of a happily ever after in more ways than one. Due to the pandemic and trying to start trauma recovery, I had another bomb-out semester and went on a leave of absence. My grandmother became a statistic- one of 4 million and counting lives ended by this plague. With her death came the death of the worldview she had given me- the innocence, the romanticism, the hope.  Sometimes I still listen to the songs that I used to daydream to, and I revisit those past places, but it doesn’t feel the same. The magic, ethereal place where my siblings lived doesn’t exist anymore. I feel empty, but at the same time, I feel freed. There are no more notions of purity or perfection to live up to, no more ghosts following me around.The best song to describe this time in my life is Anita Baker’s “Fairy Tales”: *“My fantasy is over. My life must now begin.”*

How abortion helped me,"I am disabled and have mental illness which I'm still trying to stabilize with medication. Less than ideal situation to raise a new born. Not enough rooms, not enough money. Little support. Potentially dangerous medication. Not to mention I was drinking during the pregnancy both before and after I found out I was pregnant due to stress.

I found out I was pregnant weeks earlier and had booked a surgical abortion the week before but got scared and rescheduled.

I contacted lethemlive.org but they never replied to me so I had my abortion last week on the 29th at 15w. During the ultrasound the tech told me it was a girl but I had to go through with the abortion now otherwise it was going to be unaffordable for me later.

I am relieved that I don't have to deal with the stress of continuing the pregnancy that I can't afford and ruining my college.

I'm thankful that in my country I could access abortion in a safe and timely manner.

I'm also relieved my country has 150 meter safe zones around clinics so no one could try to harass me as I went in and out.

I am happy that I have a brighter future ahead of me now I can finish college.

I feel like I had to choose between two less than ideal choices and I choose what was best for my survival ultimately. I don't regret the abortion but I wish this situation didn't occur. I don't feel guilt or like I was selfish because chosing your survival isn't selfish and if you think it is that is your issue not mine.

I know this helped me now so I am better able to have a family later and not be in poverty.

I am relieved I don't have to deal with a pregnancy while my mental health is poor and that one day when it is better and I am ready I can.

Hope this helps someone xx",t2_5vlvig8t,1625657634,prochoice

Donating to abortion funds: what’s the best way to go about it?,"I’d like to set up a monthly donation to an abortion fund. I can’t afford too much, but something like $10 a month. I work in health care and am always hearing from reproductive rights activists to “donate to your local abortion fund,” but is that the right thing to do if you live in a state where your state legislature has a Democratic supermajority and likely won’t turn red anytime soon?

 For example, let’s say I live in California (I don’t, but my state has similar laws). If Roe falls, the abortion laws in CA won’t change. However, there are still a lot of individuals who need the financial assistance to receive an abortion, whether they’re in San Francisco or Arkansas. However, those in these red have their rights actively under attack and need the most immediate help.

I received several compliments on my shirt this weekend and it made me feel so good.,"For some background, I am a 34 year old male and around when COVID was really starting to hit hard I ordered a t-shirt online that is black with white, bold text on it that just says ""Pro Fucking Choice."" I haven't really had many opportunities to wear it in public, but since COVID is finally calming down a bit, there are a lot more people that are ""out and about.""  


I didn't really think much of it but I grabbed this shirt to wear and I did some shopping this weekend. In the course of a very short amount of time I received four compliments from women ranging from very young (early 20's) to older (late 50's). All of them said ""I love your shirt!"" and one of them gave me a strong thumbs up.  


It made me feel so good to openly show my support. I was hesitant to wear the shirt; not because I am ashamed of the message, but because people get offended by dumb things and especially swear words, so I didn't want the negative attention on me. But there was not a single. negative. thing said about my shirt and it was only compliments. I just really wanted to share this because it just made me feel good.

My (Male) Coworker Said This Today,"One of my male coworkers said today about abortion, ""It's not the baby's fault it exists. If you have an unwanted pregnancy, just give it up for adoption. It's your fault you're pregnant anyway.""

And my father once said, ""Abortion is immoral! Just give the baby up for adoption! Someone else WILL want the baby!""

Pregnancy and childbirth aren't just minor inconveniences, even if you choose adoption! I have seen many stories of women choosing adoption, but still regret it and wish they chose abortion because it wrecked their bodies, derailed their life, and even gave a few women PTSD, disabilities, and long-term/permanent illnesses/injuries. My coworker's statement implied it's only women that are at fault for unwanted pregnancies and should be forced into parenthood, but not men. And, aren't there hundreds of thousands of foster children every year and a lot of them never get adopted? And our foster system is full of abuse and corruption. 

Pro-forced-reproductioners don't truly care about life. They're misogynists who just want to keep women submissive and out of accomplishing great things by forcing them into motherhood, plus it financially benefits them more than parenthood or abortion.",t2_wdgk8h,1625592713,prochoice

Okay, yes the Catholic church is against things like contraception and sterilization but what about saying no?

Think about that, you're not aborting a fetus but you're preventing a fetus from being formed by denying a person from being created.

"Haven't seen this covered yet; Pro-lifers in the UK think they've scored a ""victory"" after the proposed changes to NC55 was dismissed.","For those unaware, NC55 was going to be an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. The changes would decimalize abortion and make illegal protesting about it within a ""buffer zone"".

Women in the UK currently need two doctors to agree to them accessing abortion services. This system works well. I have never once heard of a woman being denied an abortion under this system (except for when equipment hasn't been available). The first alteration to NC55 would mean that women would no longer need two doctors to sign off on an abortion. The changes would also mean that forcing another person in to an abortion would be a criminal act and prosecuted as its own offense (as well as the protest ban). 

Other than that, nothing about the current limitations on abortion would have changed.

Pro-lifers, on the other hand, seemed to think that the decriminalizing of abortions would mean that they would be allowed up to birth at the mother's whim. *This is not the case*. The age limitations would not have changed (there's actually been a push to lower the limit to 20 weeks). The decimalization would have continued to uphold the limit, it just meant that those done in the selected time frame would not need the doctor sign off. 

They are celebrating something not happening which wasn't going to happen anyway, regardless of their protesting. I suppose you have to grasp at straws sometimes.",t2_5776fslw,1625516249,prochoice

Pro-life people need to be against evictions that lead to homelessness if they want to be consistent.,"An abortion is not the killing of a fetus but instead the removal of a fetus from your body which leads to its death. This is not the intent, this is the consequence. If the fetus could survive outside of the womb we would not kill it. We do not wish to kill the fetus.

If a pro-life person was to be consistent then they would understand that a landlord does not intend to kill a person who lost their job and is having trouble finding work. This person lost their job and is about to be evicted. Pro-life people need to be against this because homelessness can lead to death because of starvation and being open to the elements.

What's that? Something something the homeless person could just choose to get a job? Yeah, the number of jobs are actually shrinking. We have a limited number of jobs available and they're only getting smaller as automation keeps taking them.

If some people can't find work cuz there aren't jobs available that means that some people don't get to live.

Of course we could just fix all this with things like universal basic income and a right to housing but why focus on that when we can focus on controlling women's bodies.

Pro-life people are inconsistent and they don't really fight for life, they just fight for the right to control women's bodies and the right to be born.

As a former fetus, I don't want you to protect my right to be born, I want you to protect my right to live.

Abortion stories on the PL sub are horrifying and gut wrenching but not for the reasons they think,"Been reading through their abortion stories tag and I have been filled with sorrow. I don't comment on them because I don't want to hurt these people any more than they already are. These people really believe that their stories are helpful to their cause and will sway people from choosing to end their pregnancies. However, they are doing a disservice to their own cause and here's why: 

&amp;#x200B;

There's an underlying theme of shame and guilt to every story and they almost never go into their complicated reasons as to why they did it. It's as if they are trying to pretend those complicated reasons don't exist. This is because their religion taught them that it doesn't matter why they had an abortion. What they did was a sin and worthy of mountains of guilt and shame. It doesn't matter if they are trapped in a marriage with an abusive partner and don't want to bring another child into the family to be abused just like everyone else. It doesn't matter if they are in poverty and can't afford another child. It doesn't matter if they have mental health issues and can not care for a child. They believe that having an abortion is really bad and they need to feel overwhelmingly guilty for what they've done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of their religious beliefs and all of the guilt and shame associated with their views, they are traumatized by their abortions and seek some sort of catharsis and comradery with like minded people and post their stories in their sub. Unfortunately, the responses they receive are about what you would expect: halfway supportive and loads of preaching, and outright disgusting comments about how they should be excommunicated from their respective congregations and need to beg god for forgiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am horrified by these stories because the women who share them are full of self doubt, ashamed of themselves, depressed, traumatized, and have surrounded themselves with people who will validate these feelings they are having. If you are pro life, you should not have an abortion. Not because you don't have the right to one, but because you have subjected yourself to a harmful ideology that will constantly beat you down over it for the rest of your life.",t2_c4topskr,1625429208,prochoice

If I have sex (which is done so with protection) and I by some fluke of biological bullshit end up pregnant then I will be evicting what is IN MY OPINION a parasite. If abortion becomes illegal and I can’t get some black market pills and throwing myself in horrible situations that end in my personal injury doesn’t cause a miscarriage then I’ll starve myself until I do.

My point? I am the master of my own destiny and FUCK anyone who says otherwise. I’ll cause a miscarriage/get an abortion one way or another, even if I have to go into debt because it is WORLDS better than tearing apart my reproductive bits, permanently altering my chemistry, ruining my breasts/abdomen/EVERYTHING for something I never gave consent to stay within me.

If people try to tie me down and force me to go through the pregnancy I will go insane. I will bite, kick, claw, scream, I will tear my tongue apart with my teeth and drown myself on the blood resulting in my and the parasites deaths.

You nor anyone else can ever HOPE to stop me. I refuse to relinquish ownership of my body to ANYTHING. No piece of paper will EVER get to dictate what I can or cannot do, no PERSON will have a say over what I can or cannot do.

How abortion helped my family,"So my brother and I were planned pregnancies born to a loving mother. But we weren’t my mom’s only pregnancies. Before a couple years before we were born, my mom was in a very dark place in her life and was on antidepressants. During that time was the first time she found out she was pregnant. She knew she wasn’t in her right mind to be taking care of a child, and the medication she was taking had a risk of causing birth defects, so she decided to get an abortion. She told me it was early on, but not early enough for her to just take a pill and shed the fetus with her uterine lining. I asked her how the procedure went, and she said that she remembered that it was a bit uncomfortable and that she had cramping and a little bleeding a couple days after, but that she was ok throughout the process and was fine afterwards. It clearly didn’t have any effect on her ability to give birth afterwards because my brother and I were healthy babies and went through a healthy pregnancy. 

This was back around 1993, AND in Texas, and she said she couldn’t remember experiencing any pushback for her decision, nor any difficulty seeking care. I wonder what happened between then and now. 

Lastly, my mom experienced one more pregnancy after my brother and I were born. It was unplanned, and our family was going through some stressful circumstances. She decided to keep the child, but miscarried in the second trimester after they couldn’t find its heartbeat anymore after a routine checkup. 

All this to say that every pregnancy is different, circumstances change, and that choice and education is of utmost importance. I don’t want to think about what my mom and dad would have had to go through if abortion wasn’t an option and miscarriages were treated with suspicion. My dad spent long hours at a hospital training to be a surgeon, and my mom was struggling desperately with her mental health all while moving to a new state far away from friends and family. 

My mom is not a murderer. She did what was best for herself and her family under the circumstances, and I think she chose well. She has no regrets.",t2_mz5ef,1625327617,prochoice

I think it's okay to think that the ZEF is a baby at the moment of conception and still be pro-choice.,"Okay, let's see if I don't get downvoted to hell. I think the zygote is a baby, not like a baby baby but like I think it's okay to think of it as a human.

It's not that we think that wanted children are the only people worth protecting.

It's that independent children, children who are biologically independent and do not require someone else's body in order to survive on a daily basis are worth protecting.

Because the thing is is that it's not about whether these people are wanted, it's about whether we want them to use our bodies to survive.

People who are unwanted in the world deserve to be protected because they don't require someone else's body to survive on a daily basis. They've got their own biological systems.

I read an article on Facebook on how the fetus actually takes blood from the woman (and acts as a parasite),"I read an article on Facebook about why humans are one of the only animals on the planet to have periods. A woman with a Ph.d in biology answered it. What she basically said was that pregnancy in humans are different than other mammals. The placenta is more attached to humans (also with chimps and gorillas) than other mammals. The placenta walls literally burrow through the main blood supply of the woman. This means the fetus has “direct, unrestricted access to its mother’s blood supply”.
This is a biological reasoning of whey fetuses are compared to parasites (this article doesn’t mention how fetuses act like parasites). The fetus uses the uterus. The woman can do whatever she wants with her body, including her uterus (in my opinion). The fetus cannot use the woman’s uterus without her consent. Pregnancy is debilitating to women (which is addressed in the article). Pro-lifers don’t want to accept that pregnancy can cripple a woman, mentally and physically. 
I just found this article interesting because I (in my opinion) now have scientific backing about how a fetus literally acts like a parasite. Biologically, a fetus uses the woman’s blood supply without her permission. This is why I support the opinion, “my body, my choice”.

Arkansas Abortion Support Network has had to pause support for the month of July and is asking for donations.,"As many know, the South is the most difficult area in the US to obtain a safe and legal abortion. Along with being the poorest region of the country, there are very few abortion clinics and most states have laws forcing patients to receive counseling (often state mandated speeches where providers are forced to lie to their patients about the safety of abortions and supposed personhood of the ZEF) and then come back to the clinic usually 28 to 72 hours later. This limited access coupled with coupled with mandatory waiting periods forces patients to travel sometimes hundreds or even thousands of miles for care and to often have to miss days of work and stay in a hotel one or more nights. This greatly raises the price of an abortion and travel expenses. This is even worse for patients with severe fetal defects or others who might need an abortion in the second trimester or later, as many of these states limit abortion even before viability and many local clinics sometimes stop performing abortions even before the limit because of TRAP laws and difficultly finding providers willing to reside in such a hostile area. These factors often lead many needing abortion care past the first trimester to have to travel possibly multiple states away.

As such, it comes as no surprise that abortion funds everywhere, but especially the South, are extremely overburdened with requests and have difficulty meeting the needs of people from their states. This has been made even worse since the pandemic as more people have been needing to travel for care because of anti-choice governors attempting to claim abortion care providers aren’t essential and forcing them to close. Additionally, many donors have been laid off or have less income to make their monthly donations. 

Currently Arkansas Abortion Support Network is dealing with these issues and have had to pause their support for the month of July because of lack of available funds. In this time they are asking for donations so that they can pick back up in August.

I finally watched that video on AbortionReality.com,"Because apparently this is the “poster child” for every prolifer’s arguments. So I was like “eff it, what’s the worst they can show me?” 

So here’s my thoughts on it. It’s gross, almost abhorrently so. But I can say the same thing about birthing videos, which I have also seen. Babies are nasty when they come out of the womb, fully-formed or not. The fetuses also look very human, but not *quite* human enough, so something feels very wrong looking at them. (Also, the video is super short, like 1min long.)

I think there’s possibly some instinctual reaction we have to seeing a fetus, since evolutionarily, if we see one, it means there’s a miscarriage and our species would rather successfully reproduce. 

It’s also hard to see a human being and think “nah, they can’t feel that.” So it’s counterintuitive. We also have an instinctual need to protect our young, even if they’re not ours. 

The bottom line is that I believe this video to be very effective propaganda. It is extremely myopic in its view of the abortion debate, leaving out women entirely. If, say, the video worked like prescription drug commercials in the US and had the side effects of pregnancy scrolling by the whole time, it would be much less effective. 

All in all, an unfortunate truth about the abortion debate is that prolife people have evolution on their side. Nature doesn’t care about consent or “human rights.” It just wants the most living and fucking possible. Of course, to offset that, nature also creates atrocities like disease, predation, and resource shortages, but humans are already good at solving those problems (at least, when we want to be). Humanity’s current hurtle is to overcome our instincts for power and slavery. It is no longer enough to just “exist.” We should be thriving. Prolifers are part of that human psyche that hasn’t made that leap yet. On the contrary, they devalue the importance of thriving because they’re still focused on procreating. 

By all means, this is not me becoming prolife. I can recognize my instinctual impulses without discounting or minimizing my higher-order thinking. I just wanted to possibly shed some light on my experience with prolife media and my theories on the prolife psyche.",t2_mz5ef,1625238596,prochoice

"If ZEFs are people, how will personhood be legally enforced?","""ZEF"" = zygote, embryo, or fetus.

 Children--and adults--have human rights besides not being killed. But children especially deserve certain protections: the right to be fed and to receive healthcare. Certainly like all persons, their existence must be on file with the State, and if they die, the cause of death must be determined.

To address the forced-birther claim that they would never criminalize miscarriage: Remember that it can’t be assumed a miscarriage happened naturally. They can occur by eating certain foods or taking certain medicines; a fall can induce one as well. So it is possible that a woman could have intentionally caused the termination of her pregnancy even if she wasn’t caught obtaining an abortion. Even if she unintentionally caused the termination, such as by wearing slippery shoes on the stairs or consuming spinach, then just as with the death of a child brought about by negligent actions, the responsible person must be held accountable.

And even if a woman whose fetus died isn’t ultimately punished, there would still need to be the arrest and examination to determine how the pregnancy ended.

I could go into detail about how the other safeguards for the unborn I mentioned would be put in place, but this post might get long. It’s something to think about, though. And I would especially like to see forced-birth advocates address the question of treating ZEFs equally to children other than by banning abortion.",t2_89mlri23,1625185771,prochoice

How I became pro choice.,"Former lifer here. I grew up sex negative and would get upset women aren't ""smart enough"" to not have sex, and avoid ""troublesome things like pregnancy, STD and abortion."" I never got sexual feelings and attraction, so it was easy for me to think like that.

Even without this sex negativity, I was ignorant about how damaging (and life threatening, even) pregnancy could be. Therefore I could only see an innocent and helpless baby vs a more powerful adult. It was a no brainer for me what my stance was.

However, my anti abortion stance was partly due to me being religious. After I left, I decided to start all over and learn about controversial topics without religion as my reasoning.

Then I learned how trying to stop people having abortion is like trying to control the tides: a madman's mission. How pregnancy is a dice roll of an inexhaustible list of risks, and how it was more realistic to make sure women don't get lifelong disability or die in an abortion than to force people away from it.

I was then able to empathize with people who sought abortions beyond the usual ""rape, severe defect and dying"" reasons, and become pro choice.

I share my story because I want people to know that ignorance can be cured. Some lifer minds could be changed because of this. However, believing that nothing matters more than the ""innocent"" fetus's right to life, or an AFABs sexual ethic, now that's way harder to cure.

She claims that if they can take on multiple people and are “very good at their job” deserve to be paid more than those like people who are slow that can only take on 1 or 3 people at a time.

"Masculine ""abortion"": Should men also have a right on deciding whether they want to take responsability of a child?","First i got to say that this is comflicting even for me, as i have sisters which i love and i wouldn't be able to come into terms with an scenario in which their are left on their own, however, the idea is there and i kinda want to hear more opinions on this.

**Introduction:**

This is my perspective, so sorry if i'm somewhat wrong on this: aside from crimes against women and health risks during pregnancy, One of the pillars of being pro-choice is to advocate for a human being right to make the decision of not giving birth, a personal decision they take due to having other responsabilities, not wanting childs, not being prepared to raise a child, etc, etc, 

This, regardless of sides, should be something perceived as logical, people, as individuals, should have a right to decide on things that have a huge impact in their lifes.

 **The proposed scenario:**

What if a woman wants to give birth... but the father doesn't? (For this, multiple reasons can be given having their respective analogues to a woman who wants to abort, non-consensual sex, failed contraconceptives, even just a ""slip"").

The father can't and shouldn't decide/force the woman to go through with an abortion... But what about he himself? 

**The current result of the proposed scenario:**

For that there's only a few a set of actions the man can take... accept it/""suck it up"" and take on his responsabilities or  ""run away"" from his responsabilities and be forced to pay child support.

For one, the man could or not eventually become ""happy"" with his situation... at the risk or having a bad relationship with their partner and child... for the other... while ""happy"" he is now seen as a ""bad/irresponsable person"" and has his life weighed down by having to pay child support... (many self-destruct their financial lifes at that point).

**Not wanting to have a child, Not being ready to have a child.**

A simple solution, but that is often rejected as an argument since it's simple not the answer for everyone: Sterilization. it's simple right?, if a man doesn't want to have children all he has to do is go trought a vasectomy... but can you force him to? oh, there's also contraceptives... what if that fails... what if he just makes a mistake, in both cases a woman should be able to have an abortion... but what about the man? should his life be decided by the woman wanting or not the child?

The reasons for the man to not want to have to raise a child? plenty, as many as a women would have...

**The Question:**

Under this circunstances... should a man have a legal way to forfeit his responsabilities as a parent?",t2_6gank2lf,1624900031,prochoice

Concerned about medical abortion,"Hello. I had a medical abortion (the abortion pills) 17 days ago now. My overall experience wasn’t too bad but I am concerned now. I bled a decent amount for about 7 days following the abortion. I then spotted for about 2 and then the bleeding completely subsided. On day 10 I had sex and on day 14 I did an intense workout. On day 15 I got my follow up ultra sound which confirmed a clear uterus but as soon as I got home that day I began bleeding. 


Ar my appointment, I also mentioned my vagina was itchy and uncomfortable and I believed there to be an infection- the nurse (who only spoke to me over the phone) said she didn’t want to prescribe me antibiotics yet so she told me to take Monistat 3. I took it that night when I got home and the bleeding was much heavier by the time I woke up the next day (yesterday). I have now been bleeding decently heavy the last couple of days (not an alarming amount - I could wear the same pad all day and night if it wasn’t for hygiene but when I go to the bathroom it’s very bloody if that makes sense)

I am just concerned as it fully stopped for days then resumed. I realize sex and exercise (and also thinking perhaps the wand they use for the ultrasound) can provoke this just think it’s weird that this is happening  17 days post. Does anyone have any insight on this matter? The nurse said not to worry but it felt like she wasn’t listening to me. 

Any knowledge is appreciated! Also if anyone knows what I can do to speed up the bleeding process, that would be great!",t2_6ejhet7z,1624592832,prochoice

I am solely entitled to my body - and you are solely entitled to yours,"What is with this weird underlying concept that women and people with a uterus should give up their bodily autonomy for the sake of their child/fetus?

Like, the fetus should have its BA and BI preserved and intact, but in order to do this, the mother must lose hers.

And oddly, prolifers won't even admit this factor. They have to frame it as your not having the right to kill your child... They can't even acknowledge that autonomy is taken from you in their crusade because it is so negligible to them. It's an after thought that gets hand waved away because they are so used to society treating women as property. 

It further perpetuates this notion that women are meant to be fragmented. That their being whole is secondary to the wholeness of others. That their bodies and beings are meant for the use of others above her own use. She gets rights to her body second.

This is a common theme throughout history. Women have been the property of their fathers and then their husbands. Then the property of their children. And this theme continues to this day. We are the property of our children in the eyes of others.

I say I am the property of myself. I own me. I *am* me. You don't have rights to this body. Plain and simple.

A case of forced-birthers physically stopping a child from getting an abortion (rant),"[This case](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/20/10-year-old-girls-ordeal-have-legal-abortion-brazil#) is a year old, but I recently re-discovered it a few weeks ago.

The story is that a 10 year old girl from Brazil who had been raped by a family member and got pregnant. ""Pro-lifers"" physically stopped the girl from getting into the hospital where the procedure had to be done.

Forced-birthers discovered the girl's name and location where she was going to get the abortion (which is illegal in Brazil.) In a photo, the ""pro-lifers"" are linking arms, physically stopping the girl getting through.

The girl's ordeal didn't even start at the hospital. She had to be flown over 900 miles to get to the hospital to get the procedure done. The child then had to be hidden in the trunk of a car to get into the facility. It is also reported that she was holding two stuffed animals.

This angers me. Imagine being a literal child, already having to go through the trauma of repeated rapes, then to go to a foreign place far from her home, being yelled at going into the hospital. Then being scared and alone in the trunk of a minivan. She probably didn't even know what was going on or what was happening.

I'm not sure if the protesters knew the kid's age, but even if they didn't, they don't have the right to stop someone from a normal procedure. I don't like to assume all pro-lifers are the same, but what I do understand is that all of them want to outlaw abortion. This is what every pro-lifer wants. This child had her innocence taken away, and it wasn't fair to the girl or her family to be treated like this. Forced-birthers literally see women and girls as incubators. They don't care about a girl's physical ability (or even feelings or her mental well-being) to carry a child to term. This is what happens when people se the fetus as a person. All these ""pro-lifers"" only care about is a non-sentient thing that can't even survive on its own.

What I've seen is that pro-lifers just group women who has had abortions into one group, not caring about the reasons for their abortions, and see them as objects. They see them as statistics. With pro-choicers, I see them caring about each individual woman, not caring or minding why they're getting an abortion.

I hate it when pro lifers try to pretend their arguments are feminist,"One argument that I have seen quite a lot lately, and that I particularly despise, is the idea that abortion, and by extension the contraceptive pill/implant etc, are 'anti-woman' because they treat women's fertility as a bad thing. An article was posted yesterday on this sub that basically made this argument, and it was infuriating to read.

Pro life 'feminists' online continuously say things like the following:

\-Abortion is sexist because it perpetuates the idea that pregnancy, something the female body is designed to do, is bad

\-Birthing babies is women's 'superpower' and our 'most important function' and treating it as a negative thing is anti woman

To this I say: how on earth is it anti woman to say that each woman should have control and freedom over her own body and fertility? When I take my pill, it doesn't mean I think female fertility is bad or that there's something wrong with my body. It just means that I personally, at this point in my life, do not wish to become pregnant. Lots of women use contraceptives because they either do not want to be pregnant yet, or they have been pregnant and don't want another baby. It's not about thinking 'fertility bad'. It's about wanting control over our lives and bodies. I really don't understand the thought process behind these 'pro life feminists'. Do they think it's anti woman if a woman never wants to have sex and get pregnant? Or if a woman gets sterilised? How the hell is it NOT anti woman to think that being fertile is a woman's main purpose? Just think about that. These people tell us that the most important thing about women is their ability to create more people, and then have the audacity to say that WE are sexist. 

Also, these people are living in some kind of delusional fantasy world when they insist that fertility is 'a gift' and 'a blessing' and that it's sexist to say anything bad about it. It's not a blessing if you're a tokophobic woman and being pregnant would literally make you want to kill yourself. It's not a blessing if you have severe health issues that would make pregnancy and birth very dangerous. It's not a blessing if you die in childbirth. Why can't they be realistic for a change and accept that pregnancy and childbirth can and do ruin women's lives?

Another insidious strawman argument is the claim that being pro choice is sexist because we are telling women that they aren't 'strong enough' to have children. Again, living in a fantasy world when they insist that every teenager who gets pregnant in high school could carry to term and be completely fine. Moreover, ignoring the fact that pregnancy and childbirth can literally kill you or leave you permanently disabled, does that mean nobody should be allowed to get surgeries to fix temporary or non debilitating health problems? Does offering them the choice to have surgery mean you're telling them they're not 'strong enough'? No, of course not. Giving women the choice of abortion doesn't mean we're telling them they can't carry to term. Of course they can, if they want to.",t2_8lje7nkm,1624275105,prochoice

We see a Pope that says that helping the poor and achieving justice for all people is a more urgent/relevant issue than abortion. What do you think of this story by the New York Times and what can we hope for? Of course, this is assuming Catholics take the advise of the Pope to heart. I will admit that I don’t believe this will change most of their minds sometime soon but it is definitely a great retort when someone uses Catholicism as a reason to consider themselves pro-life/ pro-birth.

Good faith question from a pro choicer.,"I’ve been pro choice for as long as I’ve understood the topic. For full transparency I’m a male in his late 20’s.

I fully support a woman’s right to abort but when I see pregnant women smoking, drinking, etc it seems very irresponsible/cruel to me to do that to a baby you plan on bringing into the world. 

So I guess I’m conflicted that she has the undeniable right to bodily autonomy but can simultaneously effect the life of that child’s development forever.

Here's My Tea About Pro-life Billboards,"Currently living in SW VA and there are a large number of fullterm babies pictured with captions like ""I had fingerprints at 9 weeks"". They are getting on my ever lasting nerve as someone who has studied biology and anatomy &amp; physiology it is a VERY misleading statement. They aren't showing the tadpole looking creature a 9 week old featus is, they aren't telling you how it is nonviable at that age, they aren't letting you see just how tiny and reliant a 9 week old featus is while developing. The science is cool yeah and what is there at certain stages of development is pretty f*cking amazing, but it doesn't give you a right to use it as some propaganda fodder to try and manipulate someone into keeping a baby they may not be able to handle. If you were really pro-life you would be giving schools better sex education classes instead of the abstinence based bull$hit you teach in these areas that has been statistically proven to not help prevent teen pregnancy. You could put the money you're throwing into billboards into helping find foster parents for the children that have already been given up for adoption. Instead you are too worried about judging what people do about a life that isn't even brought into this world yet and that you have no right to make any judgements about. I am so tired of hearing about these people being worried about choices that have nothing to do with them and are frankly none of their business when there are people actually suffering around us every day that get ignored. Law makers are so worried about regulating what people do in the bedroom and the consequences of it, but don't care about their granny rotting away in a nursing home that has become a money game.

"""Consent to sex is consent to pregnancy""","This came out way longer than I originally planned, also not sure if I chose the right flair, I'm sorry. 

A pro-life argument I see a lot is that, even when using birth control, you could still end up pregnant, so consent to sex is consent to pregnancy. 

While I agree with the premise, consenting to pregnancy doesn't imply consenting to a full term pregnancy, but rather to any possible way to end it, which - beside childbirth - also includes abortion. 

When I have sex knowing I'm legally allowed to have a safe abortion, I consent to the possibility that I'll have to take abortion pills and have strong cramps for a few days, but I don't agree with having my body permanently changed, having my vagina become one with my anus or prolapse, I do not accept the risk of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or PDD (just to name a few). 

Now, for this reason, if abortion was banned in my country I'd abstain, because my tokophobia is stronger than my sexual urges. However, sex is very important for the health of most of long term relationships. Why would I give up that level of intimacy with my partner just because an accident can happen and I could kill something that doesn't even know it's alive, for the sole reason it has human DNA? 

Now, that's when the ""abortion exists just because women don't want to be inconvenienced"" argument kicks in. You know what else is an inconvenience? Not being able to drive. When getting in a car, you consent to the fact that you could have an accident that could kill someone else. That's why responsible people don't drive drunk, sleepy or while on meds and pay attention to their surroundings (just like responsible people use contraceptives when having sex when not trying for a baby). Even then, you could still have an accident. Should we ban cars because 1.35 million people die in road accidents worldwide every year? 

Assuming the answer to the previous question was no, then why is it okay to ban abortion because it would inconvenience sexually active people that in that moment do not want children?",t2_5icmbtyh,1623936106,prochoice

Forced-birthers would rather risk us “murdering babies” than allow us to get sterilized because of potential regret,"Anyone else realize how weird and perverted this is? We live in a society with a breeder mindset and it’s no shock that forced-birthers are the ones that perpetuate it most. 

You’d think that if they’re so against “murdering babies”, they’d support sterilization on demand considering that it significantly reduces risk of pregnancy and in turn, abortion. But most (mainly religious fanatics) don’t because “sterilization is permanent” and “you might change your mind” and “everyone wants kids” and “you’ll regret it”. 

Okay, *and*? So what if I regret it? How is that going to affect you? That’ll be my issue to deal with, not yours. Why are forced-birthers more concerned with a person’s possibility of regret when it comes to sterilization than what they view as the violent slaughter of babies? 

If sterilization were on demand, millions of “innocent babies” would be saved because there’d be minimal unwanted pregnancies to begin with. But nah, just the *possibility* of women/AFAB individuals regretting their sterilization is too high a price to pay to save precious little babies. /s 

I’m not really surprised since a lot of forced-birthers don’t support other methods that are proven to decrease abortion rates like comprehensive sex ed, affordable and accessible contraceptives, livable wages, etc. But damn, they never fail to amaze me with their stupidity. 

They can’t have their cake and eat it too. You don’t support me making the responsible choice to get sterilized? Fine, but don’t bitch and cry when any and all pregnancies I have are aborted. We told you what would happen, you chose not to listen.",t2_2dlt6ebu,1623869638,prochoice

"Would like help finding articles, data for my mother","I had a political conversation with my mother a week ago, and we discussed abortion. My mother is Catholic, right-wing, and basically doesn't watch or read any news that isn't Fox. She previously worked at a ""women's health clinic"" in the Midwest, which was actually a Christian-funded anti-abortion operation. She denies this, but won't give its name. She was ""helping expectant mothers,"" as she says, though it was basically a  ""abortion is evil, why do you want to kill a baby, here have a pamphlet"" kind of place. Basically, she's the garden variety Midwest white Christian conservative. 

During our conversation, I was emphasizing about how most right-wing policies are pro-birth, but anti-woman and anti-child. I told her how her decision-making process should be based on results, and if she wants people to have less abortions, then sex education is the way to go. Better sex education, better access to contraceptive care, better access to reproductive health, etc. I don't find these opinions ""left-wing,"" but rather just science and fact-based. At the end of our conversation, she asked me to send her articles showing that what I was claiming was true. I was ecstatic, and said I'd send her some links. 

Here's the problem. 

I've read dozens and dozens of articles over the years, and it's very difficult to find the exact pieces I'm looking for. I know reproductive health leads to better opportunities for women (and indeed all people), and that access to Sex Ed lowers abortion rates, while restricting abortion only lowers the ability to have the procedure done safely. 

I need articles that are scientifically-based that demonstrate these points, and does it clearly. I'm swamped with school right now, and everything I found either illustrates the point but in a ""of course, stupid"" kind of way, or is outright dismissive and mocking to Conservatives. I'm trying to bring her closer to the table, and I fear that anything with any type of bias will only further push her away. I'm looking for things from the AP or scientific journals, and not left-leaning sites. She's not going to trust something from Mother Jones.

I'm hoping people could link me studies, data, articles, or really anything about abortion to show my mother. I'm so far to the left that I know we share almost no political ideologies, but I still love her and want to help her see that her hard-line stance is actually a negative thing. She's not an evil person, she just has little to no interaction with people outside of her limited worldview. I mean, my father subscribed to Rush Limbaugh's *paper* newsletter (as in, it was delivered in the actual mail), so you can see the environment (ie bubble) she's in. 

Also, I remember reading articles (or Twitter threads) discussing pro-life women getting abortions and being nasty during and after the process, or protesting outside until their daughter needs an abortion, etc, but I can't seem to find them. 

Please help me out. I just need some direction for resources to show my mother. She's not evil, she's just stuck in a right-wing bubble, and I want her to see the world a little better. If anyone can help me out, it would be much appreciated.",t2_2v3tea8e,1623523383,prochoice

So I’ve been seeing a lot of different things lately about how we as pro-choice people should tackle the ethical and moral standing of abortion. Here’s my take on it.,"I feel the best way to justify the ethicality and morality of abortion is to use the already present biological blueprint of a pregnant women. 

In this idea,I’m going to be equating an abortion to a miscarriage because in their truest sense abortions are medically assisted miscarriages. 

With that in mind, I want to first talk about when the majority of miscarriages happen. 

According to the Mayo Clinic, miscarriages occur mostly before the 12th week of pregnancy. 

Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/symptoms-causes/syc-20354298

So it would make moral and ethical sense to have the majority of abortions before 12 weeks of pregnancy which is true for the majority women in the US and the UK who revive an abortion, the specific statistic being 9/10 abortion are done before 12 weeks. 

Source: https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/nine-out-of-10-abortions-done-before-12-weeks-in-many-high-income-countries/

Abortion done after 12 weeks are rare and this is the same for the number of miscarriages that occur after 12 weeks so current abortion statistic match very closely to the natural processes that a women’s body will undergo during a pregnancy without medical intervention. 

The fact that the majority of pro-life people don’t say that a miscarriage is a death of a baby and is not the women’s body murdering a baby shows the hypocrisy. As soon as a miscarriage is medically induced and not done by a women’s body independently, it is labeled a murder which is absurd and inconsistent with a pro-life belief that a 12 week or less developing foetus if aborted has been murdered. 

A women who has had a miscarriage has been through a natural aborting of a pregnancy. 

Pro-life people want to talk about abortions that happen after 12 weeks but those are very few which follow the biological blueprint given to us by a pregnant women where miscarriages after 12 weeks are also rare. Therefore, the pro-choice argument remains ethically consistent but the pro-life argument does not. 

Anyway, these are just my thought and I’m not a professional in anything related to science so take this post with a grain of salt and feel free to critique it in the comments.",t2_6k00h02p,1623386593,prochoice
Intact dilation and extraction abortions seem like the safest abortion procedure for women over 13 weeks pregnant but pro-life legislators are trying to make it illegal everywhere.,"Reading up on this, I was stunned by how opposed pro-life politicians and legislators are to intact dilation and extraction which involves the foetus being removed intact. 

This makes the abortion very safe and better for the women because there is less of a chance that any of the pregnancy will be left in the uterus causing a potentially like threatening infection. 

It sickens me how much pro-life people want this procedure to be illegal. It only shows more of their true colours as a group against women’s access to proper reproductive healthcare.",t2_6k00h02p,1623379915,prochoice

My story - how I became pro-choice.,"
So I grew up in an extremely conservative family in the Bible Belt of America. I was a pretty sheltered kid and I remembered the first time I ever heard about abortion was at a birthday sleepover when I was about ten. It was an apparently true story of a women who had gone to get an abortion but the baby was alive and started to cry and was thrown in the trash anyway to die. 

That was my first encounter with what abortion was. From then on, whenever I thought of abortion, I thought of grown full term babies being thrown in the trash. That was the imagery that was feed to me from a young impressionable age by my environment. 

I would have nightmares about it, worry about all the babies that were being thrown in the trash and feel so helpless all the time thinking that murder was happening and I could do nothing to stop it. I suffered in silent agony as a child and grew up with these lingering fears which fuelled my pro-life stance as I became an adult. 

I was quite comfortable in my stance on abortion. My thought was echoing all the other pro-life people who said ‘Getting pregnant is your fault, take responsibility.’ 

But everything changed for me when I got a call from my best friend. 

We hadn’t spoken in a while and it was great to hear from her. We were chatting away and all of a sudden she goes. 

‘Yeah, I went on a date and don’t remember half of it. I think I was drugged because I woke up the next morning in this guys apartment not remembering anything after we had drinks. Then I realised a few weeks later I was pregnant. I got an abortion so it’s all fine now.’

I was stunned. I didn’t know what to say. My best friend had been date raped, had an abortion, and was now dealing with all of that on her own with no support. 

This shook me to my core. I heard the pro-lifers words ring in my skull. 

‘Women who get abortions are murders’

Suddenly everything I had built my values on came crashing down. I didn’t care what anyone thought about me because I was not going to think about my best friend like that. I refused to label what she did murder. 

Then I started researching, something I always do when I’m upset. 

Turns out 1 in 3 women will have an abortion over the course of their life and the majority of abortions don’t happen past 15 weeks. 1 in 4 women will miscarry a pregnancy and miscarriages are also most common before 12 week so really an abortion is a medically assisted miscarriage. If your body miscarries a pregnancy all on its own, why is it when a miscarriage is medically induced does it suddenly become murder if the female body does it naturally a lot anyway?

My friend had her abortion at six weeks and when I looked at the foetal development at six weeks it barely looks like a tadpole and is smaller than a goddamn pea. 

This horrific nightmare image I had been fed all my life of what abortion was had been a lie. 

The pro-life movement I’ve learned is anything but pro-life and should be more aptly renamed anti-women. 

So that’s my story, what’s yours?",t2_6k00h02p,1623366674,prochoice

My Abortion Experience: PLEASE read if you need help,"A few months ago, I got pregnant by my boyfriend and we mutually decided an abortion would be the best choice, as we're both in college and not financially ready or mature enough to give a child a good life. We just knew it didn't feel right.

I was always SO scared that I would be put in this situation. I was pro-choice, but I never thought it was something that I'd have to go through. I wanted to make this post for women who are going through this right now to let you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel. It really isn't the horrific experience you picture in your head, or at least it wasn't for me. ***This is something I wish I had to read when I was in the thick of it. I want to let anyone know what to expect so they don't have to go in there feeling the way I did.*** 

I remember taking the test and my heart dropping and crying, knowing what I'd have to do. I got an appointment at Planned Parenthood a week after I found out, making me 6 weeks at the time of my procedure.

I opted for the surgical option because I'd heard horror stories about the pill, and the thought of it being a long and drawn out process at home sounded daunting to me. I paid $400 and decided to not be put to sleep, which would have cost more. The worse part was the wait, I felt anxious and decided to read a book. I was in Planned Parenthood for around 4-5 hours. This is how the appointment went:

First I was called in to take care of the payment. I paid in cash, they handed me a stack of papers detailing the procedure, and they send me back to the waiting room.

Next, they called me in for an ultrasound. This is the part I was most scared of, but it was nowhere near as bad as I thought. They asked me if I wanted to know if it was twins or not, and I said no. I didn't have to see the ultrasound, and she told me I was six weeks along and sent me back to the waiting room again.

I was then called back in to take my blood pressure, prick my finger to take blood, and asked a few questions like if the father knew, etc. I can't remember all the questions but they weren't bad. She gave me a pain pill (nothing stronger than advil/tylenol) and sent me into the operating room. The nurse was super nice and instructed me to place a pad on my underwear for when I'm done (bring a comfortable pad!), remove my clothes, and put on the hospital gown when she left the room. 

Then the doctor came in and performed the procedure. He used the clamps like a gynecologist would to spread you out. I remember being really nervous about the numbing needle but I didn't feel it at all. I felt the numbness go up my body after he put the needle in. All it felt like was just pulling and tugging deep in your stomach and I heard the suction. It was extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable, but not painful. The whole thing lasted less than 2 minutes. In the moment, it felt terrible but it went by so fast and was FAR easier than I expected.

I felt really weak after and the nurse helped me put my clothes back on and sent me back to the recovery room. The nurse let me close the curtains around me. She gave me water and cookies. At this point, I was crying because I was so overwhelmed with what I just experienced, but I had no cramps like they warned me. The nurse instructed me to go check my pad and see how much I was bleeding. I barely saw any blood, and she told me if I felt fine I could go home. My boyfriend picked me up and I left.

When I got home, the cramps started picking up and I used a heating pad. They were no worse than regular cramps. I was back to working out the next morning. There was no bleeding for the next day, however for the week after I had heavy bleeding (heavier than a period) and cramps. It wasn't terrible or debilitating, but everyone's experience is different.  

Before going through this, I always imagined I would be triggered by seeing other young moms and look back in regret wishing I made a different decision. I went back and forth in my head and decided if I really wanted to live with the regret I'd undoubtedly have for the rest of my life. I went to a conservative Catholic school that engrained these beliefs in me. Now, being 3 months out, I feel nothing but relief and sympathy/slight sadness towards myself for going through it. 

I promise, what you're feeling now won't last forever. It's only temporary and it's not as bad as you're making it out to be. You'll get through it. If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask in the comments.",t2_cn5gn113,1623339481,prochoice

"I'm shocked of ""pro-lifer's"" ignorance","So I posted a question on the prolife-page, asking for opinions on my story. Basically, I told them I was raped and asked them if they thought that getting an abortion would be justified in such a case (I thankfully did not get pregnant, but just asking hypothetically). I also told them about my mental illnesses I have thanks to the abuse (PTSD, depression, OCD) and I can only say... I'm truly shocked and feeling sick looking at their answers. I expected a lot, but not this kind of complete ignorance. All of them answered without even knowing the true effects of this trauma - I mentioned that I would've killed myself (and thus the fetus with me) if I had became pregnant. Did they care about that? No. All they cared about was that I shouldn't get an abortion, no matter the consequences. If I really would have felt the need to kill myself, I ""should have checked mysel into a mental hospital where they could make sure I wouldn't do it"" - I have been in a mental hospital several times, nobody there can make sure that you won't do it, you can always find a way.

Then there were answers saying I should only be allowed to get an abortion if I filed a police report. (I don't know how that is connected to anything.) Funny thing is, I wanted to file a police report against my rapist, guess what happened? Every single lawyer I went to told me to not do it, since I didn't have any proof and the guy could denounce me for false testimony AND the case would not be brought to court anyway because of the lack of proof. (In my country, cases have to be submitted to court by an attorney, if the attorney thinks that there is not enough proof to win the case, they won't submit it. Apart from that, I have talked to countless other victims who filed a report: NONE of the rapists got convicted, even though there were witnesses etc.)

This brings us to another lovely reply. When I mentioned that the father would have custody rights and if I gave the baby up for adoption, the child would still be allowed to find out whose its biological parents are and it would be allowed to contact them, one kind guy replied: ""He won't have any rights when he is convicted."" (Without even knowing the law in my country.) Ha, well then it's good that rapists almost never get convicted, huh?

It just makes me so incredibly sick to think about the world they would want to live us in... Men raping women and women having to live with the consequences, even if it means having to carry the rapist's fetus for nine months and giving birth to it, having to risk your own life. Just so that the little bubble ""pro-lifers"" live in doesn't get destroyed. How can human beings be so cold-hearted and ignorant? Sorry for the long rant.

Speaking to an older woman who was impacted by abortion being illegal,"I'm a student nurse and a health care assistant, so as you can imagine between placement and trying to make rent I spend a lot of time in hospital. The other day I met a patient in her 90s, still very with it, very independent, very funny, an absolute firecracker of a woman. At one point a nurse asked if she had any children and she very clearly and emphatically said 'I have one son and hate him'. She went on to explain that she had gotten pregnant accidentally at a time when she wasn't able to access abortion. She said that she doesn't like kids, especially teenagers, never wanted them and that she basically has nothing to do with her son (who would be in his 60s at youngest by now), never wants to see him again, wishes he were dead, etc,. 

 I find this a great example of how wrong people are when they claim that if a woman who didn't want a baby gives birth she'll immediately change her mind and become a loving mother, and that all women secretly want kids and that no one ever regrets children. It also flies in the face of the idea that needing access to abortion and not wanting kids is a modern thing, this woman was in her mid-90s speaking in no uncertain terms that if it weren't for abortion being illegal and inaccessible she wouldn't have had her son and wished it were that way. 

I'm not gonna speculate too much on how this woman may have been as a mother, but I'm sure she wasn't exactly the best given how she feels and its very sad her son had to experience being raised by someone who didn't want him, and only had him because she was unable to access abortion and the stigma around being unmarried and pregnant at the time even made adoption difficult. 

I kind of wish that some anti-abortion people could have seen this woman speak, partially to see their faces, but mostly because it shows what can happen when they restrict abortion access. Forcing people to have babies against their will doesn't magically turn women into amazing mothers, it imposes children on women who don't want them, can't care for them in the way they need, and just damages all involved.",t2_1jvlizv6,1623278323,prochoice

Thoughts?,"To quote my favorite post on this sub of all time

&gt; Hey, I need your help with an unrelated issue.

&gt; Pro freedom movement 

&gt; Hey guys, I know this isn’t really related to what you do, but I figured since you were into human rights and all you might want to help me out. 

&gt; I’m trying to found the Pro-Freedom movement. Now let me explain where this all begins. 

&gt; I own a beach front property, and sea turtles have laid their eggs on my beach. I believe it is my right as a property owner to stomp on those eggs. 

&gt; Look, it’s my property and I should have the right to do what I want on my property. And more importantly, nothing else should have the right to use my property without my consent. 

&gt; And people are like “oh, but sea turtles are endangered! You can’t just stomp on their nests!”  Sure, whatever. But it’s not like these are even REAL sea turtles that are alive. They’re just a clump of shells. Besides, a lot of sea turtle eggs never hatch or are eaten by predators anyway. And even then, with the ocean all polluted and filled with predators, they’re probably just going to wind up living short, painful lives anyway. Stomping them now is practically a kindness! 

&gt; Oh, and how many of those anti-freedom assholes are actually out there in the ocean with nets cleaning up pollution? Typical anti-freedom assholes only care about sea turtles when they’re on MY beach, practically forcing me to be a veterinarian for months at a time. It’s dehumanizing! 

&gt; I know turtles lay their eggs on peoples beach front property all the time, and they’re just expected to let them hatch, but having big old barriers and signs? And knowing I can’t use my beach the way I want to when I want to? Not to mention the salmonella reptiles carry and the seagulls they bring in, and the parasites on them. It’s a financial burden and a risk to my health no less.  

&gt; And some people have the audacity to say that if I engage in behavior that would draw in sea turtles to lay their eggs, I should accept that risk. It’s like they are trying to punish me for owning beach front property. And I bet most of these assholes don’t even have a shoreline. If you ask me, the only person who should have any say in wether someone stomps on sea turtle eggs are people who own beach front properties. If it doesn’t affect you, KEEP YOUR LANDLOCKED LAWS OFF MY SAND! 

&gt; Anyway, it’s such an obvious thing that stomping sea turtle eggs should be a constitutional- no, human right. Please show your support for the Pro-freedom movement.",t2_9sf928t1,1623214373,prochoice
How has this anti-abortion activist not faced legal consequences for this action?,"There is an anti-abortion activist named Lila Rose who is known for launching undercover sting “investigations” against Planned Parenthood. One of her stings involves her posing as an underage pregnant girl, sneaking into clinics, and filming the clinic workers without their knowledge. She uses the footage as a way to claim that Planned Parenthood wasn’t following the law when it came to reporting the abuse of minors to the authorities. [Here](https://www.liveaction.org/what-we-do/investigations/child-sex-trafficking-cover-up/) is the link to her website page where she makes the claim through her organization, Live Action.

Around the same time, Planned Parenthood reported the alleged abuse to the authorities, as demonstrated by this [letter PDF](https://www.liveaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PP-letter-to-AG-Holder-re-sex-trafficking-1-18-11.pdf). In other words, there is proof that Lila’s claim about Planned Parenthood’s “child sex trafficking cover-up” is false. So here is my question: Why hasn’t Planned Parenthood pressed charges against this woman for making a serious, verifiably false allegation against them? I’m no legal expert, but from what I’ve seen, it genuinely looks like she’s framing people for a crime.

Interesting how 'consent to an action is consent to its consequences' doesn't apply to men who 'mourn' their partners' abortions,"Pro lifers constantly say that consent to sex is consent to pregnancy: the woman knew that a pregnancy might occur if she has sex, so by consenting to sex she is automatically consenting to the possible consequence, aka pregnancy.

But why do they never apply this logic to men who 'mourn' their partners' abortions? I say this because a video was recently posted on the PL sub interviewing various men whose partner had an abortion against their wishes. 

If you are a man and you live in a country where a woman can legally get an abortion for any reason, according to PL logic, when you have sex with a woman you are consenting to her getting an abortion since you consented to sex knowing that A) it might cause a pregnancy and B) if it does, the woman might abort it.

Obviously this isn't true- that isn't how consent works at all. But it's interesting how PL change the definition of consent when they want to argue that women 'consent' to their pregnancies, but can suddenly understand it completely fine when it's applied to any other situation. In the video I mentioned, the PL comments expressed nothing sympathy to these men. How come nobody was saying 'well you consented to sex knowing it might result in the woman getting an abortion, therefore you consented to the abortion. Stop complaining'. There wasn't even any hint of 'maybe he should have kept his dick in his pants if he didn't want his baby to be aborted'.",t2_8lje7nkm,1623185273,prochoice

What do you think of this hypothetical pro-life tax law?,"I’m not sure if someone else has already had this idea, nor am I saying that this would actually become a real law, but here it goes. How about we place a tax on people who are fighting to criminalize abortion? All of the money will go towards helping women and girls afford pregnancy-related healthcare, diapers, baby food, prenatal vitamins, pregnancy-related mental health counseling (if necessary), the costs associated with childbirth, etc - basically all the stuff that a pregnant woman would have to pay for if pro-lifers stop her from getting an abortion.

The idea behind this tax is that criminalizing abortion places a permanent series of preventable financial and emotional burdens on pregnant women and girls. Pregnancy and parenthood are expensive, life-altering events, especially when they occur against someone’s will. Pro-lifers should at least acknowledge the burden that making women keep unwanted pregnancies imposes on them. If women are obligated to keep unwanted pregnancies, then pro-lifers should be obligated to help alleviate at least some of the preventable burdens their laws would impose. If they care about women and children, then surely they’d be thrilled to take part in making pregnancy and motherhood more manageable, right?

Pro-lifers cannot opt out of this tax law. If women don’t have a choice, neither do they.",t2_bfmleahu,1623152561,prochoice

Responding to the anti-abortion argument that women are “strong enough” to pursue motherhood and their dreams and their claim that pro-choicers believe women are “too weak” to be moms,"An argument that I’ve seen from anti-abortion people is that women are “strong and powerful” enough to have both a child and a career. They say that motherhood won’t mess up their plans to pursue their dreams. In the same vein, they claim that pro-choicers believe that women are “too weak” to handle motherhood and an education/career. This argument misrepresents the ideas of the pro-choice movement.

The fault in their argument is that pro-choicers aren’t actually telling women that they’re too “weak” to handle both. Instead, we’re recognizing that having a baby is a serious, life-altering responsibility that consumes time, money, and energy, which can have a serious impact on someone’s ability to pursue an education and/or a career. We’re not saying that it’s impossible to do both; after all, the whole idea of being pro-choice is to support whatever choice a woman wants to make in regards to her reproductive health. We’re saying that a woman should be able to set boundaries for herself regarding these serious life events, making realistic decisions about whether or not having a child and pursuing her dreams simultaneously are feasible, desired options for her. Recognizing the serious impacts of motherhood isn’t calling women “too weak” to be moms. It’s understanding that motherhood is a major life-altering responsibility that impacts several facets of a woman’s life, including her finances, health, and career.

Let me emphasize this idea.

*It is never selfish or weak to set boundaries for your health, career, and life decisions. Instead, it’s healthy and responsible. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise values their agenda more than your health, life, and well-being, trying to manipulate you into making a decision that is not in your best interest.*

Besides, the main goal of the anti-abortion movement is not to uplift women and tell them that they can do anything that they set their minds to. Being anti-abortion doesn’t improve a woman’s ability to pursue motherhood and her dreams at the same time. Their goal is to end abortions, regardless of a woman’s reasons for getting one. Therefore, it’s disingenuous for pro-lifers to act like their motive for opposing abortion is to empower women and make them feel like they can do anything. It’s just one more bad faith attempt to make the anti-abortion movement sound pro-woman.

(Here’s a question you can use to counter the claim that pro-life is pro-woman: If she is so strong and powerful, then isn’t she empowered enough to know for herself what’s right for her life, career, and family?)

Moral of the story: don’t let anyone manipulate you with talk of women being “too weak” or “strong enough” to handle motherhood and a career, because it’s not about strength and weakness. *It’s about knowing what you’re capable of and setting boundaries for yourself.* Motherhood is one of the biggest responsibilities a person can take on, and with responsibility comes the need to be realistic. That means that people should not make these kinds of decisions based on political catchphrases based on ideas of strength and weakness, as such phrases that are more concerned with pushing an agenda rather than helping women make responsible, realistic life decisions. Pushing women to make a choice that goes against what she decides is right for her is the exact opposite of empowerment.",t2_bfmleahu,1623087450,prochoice
Question about bodily autonomy and dependency,"So I would say I’m pro choice, but recently I’ve been thinking about it properly and the bodily autonomy argument seems kind of flawed

This is the situation we’re presented with; a women has sex acknowledging the risk of pregnancy and that if conception occurs the foetus will be dependent on her for 9 months. When pregnancy unfortunately does occur she kills the foetus because it is unknowingly infringing on her rights, purely as a result of her own actions. Might just be me but this seems kind of wrong. Making someone dependent on you then not providing for them. Kind of like having a kid and not feeding them, something which is a legal responsibility

Was Paxton Smith's abortion speech fair,"if you don't know what I'm talking about search it up on YouTube

anyway, I'm pro-choice but i take issue with her approach for a couple of reasons. first off she submitted an alternate speech which was read and approved by the school but then went on to give a speech about an entirely different topic. regardless of whether or not American school's (i don't live in the US) limit expression of politics and free speech i still feel that this is wrong. she was given a platform based on the condition that she spoke about an approved topic but she purposefully deceived the school because she knew they wouldn't approve

now many people may argue that the speech was on an important ethical issue so this overrides the need to keep within the school's guidelines. however i disagree, the only reason she was congratulated is because it was an issue which many people agree with. if we flipped the script and had her giving a speech about pro-life, saying that even 6 week abortions should be banned, do you think the media and public would have the same reaction? of course not. she would be mocked and ridiculed and people would never condone her actions but, because her stance is one which many people agree with she is congratulated and seen as a hero

long story short, i think she should not have given this speech because she knowingly deceived the people giving her the platform to speak. i also think we need to acknowledge the fact that if this was any other issue people would be outraged. whether her actions were justified should be based on the act of giving an alternate speech, not the contents of the speech itself",t2_byhcv6x4,1623071733,prochoice
Question I asked r/prolife warranted an interesting response and now I'm even more invested,"So, I've been on the fence surrounding the whole pro-choice vs pro-life issue for a long time. 

On one hand, it's a goddamn baby, why *wouldn't* you give 9 months from your life to give a kid 70 years? Sounds pretty straightforward as the right thing to do.

On the other hand, a lot of the times an unwanted pregnancy can cause the mother a lot of pain and emotional distress, especially if the baby was forced on her by a terrible individual or if she's simply too young or at a bad time in her life. A lot of times, it's selfish to ask anyone in that situation to avoid abortion when it's causing so much pain, and it's not my place to say such a thing anyway. I've never been in that place and have no right to assume how it feels.


However, the other day I came across the issue of artifical wombs we'd created for sheep and I couldn't get it out of my head. In the future, could this replace abortion altogether? Then no kiddos would have to die and no mamas would have to suffer or be in pain.

So I confronted r/prolife about this issue (I used the same text and argument as I'm using up until this point to keep this debate fair and objective, no difference in language was used).

The response I got was encouragingly positive. All pro-lifers who replied to the post claimed that they thought it was a good idea and artificial wombs would be an effective compromise (of course, if they ever become possible, this is all entirely hypothetical at the moment, since the technology is still in it's infancy). 

This way, motherhood and pregnancy would never be forced on a woman and the baby would be given a chance to, well, live their best lives I guess.

Surprisingly even Christian pro-lifers had no problem with it, as it seems Christianity is only against the killing of the baby and is not against artificial wombs.

But now of course, no debate is complete without every side of the argument, so I'm here to ask pro-choicers the same thoughts on the issue.

Do you believe artificial wombs would be effective? If so, why?  Would you think it's immoral to keep babies in an artificial womb? Do you believe abortion should be prioritized over this would you *rather* have this replace it, and again, why?

Pro-lifers do not make sense in their quest to deny women bodily autonomy,"Pro-lifers don't make sense for a bunch of reasons. Keep in mind my opinion is about pro-lifers in general not the position of being pro-life even though I disagree with both the position and those who support the position. 

Imagine you are a woman just enjoying you life having fun and being happy and a glob of cells decides to steal your food and your oxygen that you spend your hard earned money on and the oxygen that came from your environment through your lungs. Now you want your food and your oxygen, but this glob keeps on taking it. Shouldn't it be your choice to control who and who can't steal from you? But it gets worse. This glob acts like a leach and can cause you to have high blood pressure which can cause pages of side effects and diseases including things like heart attacks, strokes, and even dementia which can impact you forever, but wait this glob can also give you gestational diabetes and preeclampsia which is when this glob of cells starts to hurt one of your organ systems like the kidney urinary system which can be permeant. But what there's more. You could get anemia which is chronic and can debilitate your for months to years. And even worse after 9 months of pain you could injure a nerve or get something like Guillain-Barre syndrome and end up paralyzed which could ruin your life forever.

Pro-lifers say that a woman shouldn't have the right to throw that good for nothing glob of cells away and allow her to live her life. Pro-lifers want to force women to live their life with a parasite. 

More flawed thinking with pro-lifers

* Want less abortion but don't support comprehensive sex education and increased education
* Want less abortion but won't promote easier access to birth control
* Many pro-lifers are republican and support representatives and senators who allow big pharma to control people's lives and do not support lowered prices for contraceptive
* Many of these pro-lifers don't support mass mask mandates to save thousands of lives and don't care about the lives of born humans, but instead prioritize the lives of unborn fetuses (globs of cells that do nothing for society)
* Many like those in Texas measure life by the presence of a heartbeat but do not support the criminalization of pulling the plug on brain dead patients with heart beats.
* Many use the bible to support denying women their rights but looking at  Exodus  22:21-24 if a fetus dies the person who causes the death is just given a fine and not put to death even though the requirement of killing a person is death
* In cases of rape the rapists often get parental rights forcing the other person to relive their emotional trauma and have to continue to deal with said piece of trash
* Pro-lifers don't support increase funding to adoption agencies generally
* Pro-lifers don't generally support increased healthcare and often refuse to pay the $11,000 cost to deliver a baby
* Don't promote anti-abuse laws and don't support increase funding to fighting abuse
* Don't support increased funding to families with children
* Do not support paying people who are forced to keep their children $300,000 for the cost of the child and do not support reimbursing the parents for the 40+ hrs/week that they spend with their children",t2_6nooj82e,1623028699,prochoice

Getting a tattoo for my lost boy," 

I got pregnant in January or so and it was a wild ride for all of it. it was with my bf and we wanted to keep it so bad, but the nurse misdiagnosed me with a miscarriage when i was about a month along. it was really hard and i drank, smoked, took pills, and took my non pregnancy safe medication when i thought i had miscarried. turns out i never miscarried, and im pretty sure my baby would be messed up. I also came to the realization that I didnt want my child growing up while i was in school and while never being able to see their dad who would have been working to support us.

I wasnt able to get an abortion until i was 4 months along because my bf had a concussion and couldnt drive, and i didnt want anyone else to do it. the abortion was the most traumatizing experience i had ever had in my life, for many many reasons but i wont get into that.

Since it was a bit of a late abortion, I had to have cervical dilators in me for 3 hours. It was excruciatingly painful, definitely the worst pain ive ever felt in my life. i was in the resting room with a heating pad clutched onto my stomach, unable to move for 2 hours. There was a TV on flipped to a random channel that had a 10 minute long commercial replaying. It was the ninja frying pan commercial and in my drugged up, pain induced, odd state of mind that is really my most prominent memory.

I want a tattoo on my hip of a little frying pan.

Forced birthing?,"Just prefacing this with the declaration that I am pro choice. There is one issue I don't quite understand and that is the accusation of forced birthing or forced birther. I assume it's aimed at people who propose that pregnant women should give birth rather than abort if the foetus has passed a certain stage of development? 

I'm confused because a foetus of significant size/development would have to be birthed anyway wouldn't it? I don't think it would be possible to get it out any other way? Is it that forced birthing is about whether to kill the foetus before birthing it or not? 

Just a bit confused about this one.

So gosh darn tired of engaging with anti-abortion folks during this time,"I don't know why I subject myself to this, but since the news broke out about the Oklahoman and Texan laws on abortion bans passed, I've been visiting prolife forums and articles in an attempt to understand the opposition. I remember hearing about the news and just sobbing in fury, and I felt a deep desire to understand *how* people could seek to allow this to exist. I felt like we were edging down the path of *Handmaid's tale* or something. So I sought to hear them out, and have them hear me out.

And I've wasted so much time engaging in rhetoric that boiled down to the philosophical metaphysics of ""can ya call 'em a person yet?"", which is cool and all, if it didn't, y'know, oppress the reproductive rights of countless women. My personal concerns are that such bans will most heavily impact the underprivileged and vulnerable, as financially stable adult women can usually still get legal procedures done, elsewhere. My talking points have been equated with Nazism, slavery, ableism; I've seen comments where we are made out to be absolute monsters with no capacity for empathy . . . 

And if you bring up ""but what about after they are born?"" It is brushed away with ""someone can adopt them and they will find a happy home"".... as if the current foster care / adoption system is anywhere near where it should be. 

But every time, without doubt, it boils down to ""abortion is murder"" and there is zero room for discussion. Like, shouldn't discussions on abortion bans come AFTER a society has reached a point where all women have access to pregnancy preventions??? 

I've finally reached a breaking point, I think. Ultimately, I think it may be futile to try to change their minds. All we can do is vehemently vote, since both sides think they are fighting on the right side.

Question for pro choicers,"Hello everyone. I'm personally not pro choice but I would like to ask you guys something to get a better understanding of the pro choice mindset.

I would like both your thoughts on what should be legal and what you think would be morally right.

Scenario 1
Let's say you wake up one morning hook up to a beloved figure. Someone like Michael Jordan or Will Smith. Both of these people are absolutely beloved. They have millions of fans, friends and family that cares about them and would be heart broken if something were to happen to them. But them being connected to you is the only thing keeping them alive. You have to stay in that position for nine months or else they will die. I want to know both if you think is should be legal to separate from them even though they will die and do you think it's morally acceptable to do so. Remember  they have people that love them and absolutely care about them.

Scenario 2
Same as above but this time it's a doctor that is just one day away from finding the cure for cancer. If you stay hooked up to this passed out person for just nine months he will find a cure for cancer and save so many people. I want to know if you think it should be legal to disconnect from this person even though it will kill them? Keep in mind this person is close to curing cancer.

Scenario 3
This is the same scenario as above. But this time you are hooked up to your one day old daughter or son. You have no idea how you and your kid got in this situation but you two being connected is the only thing keeping your son or daughter alive. And if you remove the tube before nine months your kid might die.
I want to know if you think it should be legal to disconnect from your one day old baby even if it's gonna kill them and do you think it should be morally acceptable to do so",t2_c6np818q,1622950438,prochoice

Let's say you punch a pregnant lady in the stomach, she's late in her first trimester (which is at the borderline of what *Roe v. Wade* deemed constitutionally-protected abortion), and she miscarries, meaning that you've killed the fetus (or baby, or whatever you want to call it). Is that murder? Or is that something else?

Thankful,"I recently had a medical abortion at 4.5 weeks pregnant. I have a 6 month old and a 2.5 year old child at home. I am married and financially stable. 

That being said, between the global pandemic, maternity leave/return to work, postpartum depression, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and multiple deaths in my immediate family... I am POSITIVE that had I carried on with the pregnancy my mental health would fully deteriorate to a place of no return. I have had a prior hospitalization from extreme anxiety. 

I would not have been able to spend this summer actually enjoying my children and doing the things that actually support me mentally (exercising, meditating, time outdoors, reading, knitting). I cannot even fathom having to work through another pregnancy. 

Being a woman is an overall shameful experience and I’m tired of it. I am grateful that I was able to have a safe medical abortion and that my husband fully supported me.

How to handle anti-choice bad faith claims? (Example of what I’m talking about below),"Hey friends,

I can’t believe I just found this community today. Love seeing a community that supports my reproductive rights. 

I wanted to ask for some advice on handling bad faith arguments from anti-choicers, specifically the argument that they make against abortion that “life is worth living no matter what” and their questions of “well, what would have happened if you were aborted?”.

I saw a post on Facebook a while ago that a pro-choice woman made that asked the latter question, and ended with something a long the lines of “this world we’re living in is miserable and I would welcome that, Karen”, and when I looked in the comments, some dumbass said “Stop projecting your issues and go to therapy”.

How do you even respond to that? First of all, I feel like anti-choicers are the ones projecting their need to force everyone into existence, even though there are a lot of problems in society that impact quality of life. But I always have a hard time responding to things like that, because at that point they’re just insulting you and clearly don’t care anyway. I feel like “stop projecting and go to therapy” is some sort of fallacy here, I just can’t put my finger on why. 

I also see this kind of thinking amongst catholic anti-choicers as well. They believe that a life of suffering is better than having never lived at all. (For context, I was raised catholic and have cut all ties with that organisation and its followers, but I still see things on social media). I don’t know how to get through to someone with that mentality.",t2_57svvmos,1622868034,prochoice

Prolife mod on abortiondebate,"Wow. I think they need to tell a prolife mod to cool off. How is this an even appropriate post? 

Mod post:

&gt;Sure, but it is 17.4 out of 100,000 live births in the US, where I am a citizen and have the right and responsibility to make these decisions.

&gt;That said, I would still argue that the best thing to do in those cases would be to aid them in getting better medical care, NOT to kill the child.

&gt;If this was the 15th Century and women were to die at a considerably higher rate than they do now, I might consider pregnancy to have been a considerably higher threat, possibly even enough to consider most pregnancies threatening, but today? Not a chance.

&gt;I am certainly not going to kill someone in the US based on what is happening in some other country. My bias is towards allowing everybody to live if it is possible, not looking for excuses to suggest that it may be too dangerous for them to be allowed to live in the hypothetical case that they happened to be gestated in the Congo.

My post:


&gt;“Sure, but it is 17.4 out of 100,000 live births in the US, where I am a citizen and have the right and responsibility to make these decisions.”

&gt;Wow. Right to make these decisions? Can you clarify that because it seems like you think you’re entitled to make decisions for women.

&gt;Your whole post seems pretty dismissive and like you’re okay with women dying as long as more children are brought into this world.


Mod post:


&gt;“Wow. Right to make these decisions? Can you clarify that because it seems like you think you’re entitled to make decisions for women.”

&gt;That's a terrible argument. You're just appealing to emotion here as well.

&gt;We make decisions for other people all the time. They're called laws.

&gt;Of course, I don't get to directly make decisions for people. I get to vote and that vote may become a law which resembles what I want later on, which I imagine you don't disagree with, right?

&gt;When you make statements like this, it makes me believe that the person making them is more interested in finding fault than understanding what is being said.

&gt;“Your whole post seems pretty dismissive and like you’re okay with women dying as long as more children are brought into this world.”

&gt;Your problem is that you don't see this as a debate. You see this as one side not caring, and one side not. Not because one side has the better points and the other side is ignoring them, but instead because you decided that it's only possible to ""care"" if you're a pro-choicer.

&gt;That's all this is.

&gt;I cannot tell you the number of times I have made statements that might be less dispassionate about the situation.

&gt;You know what happens then? Some PC poster like you suggests that I only care about the ""poor babbbyyyyys"".

&gt;When I try to keep things dispassionate, I get accused of being ""cold hearted"".

&gt;I learned a long time ago, that it doesn't matter which of the two I really am. It only matters if I have set a goal to protect the rights of all human beings, to the best of my ability, and that I make sure that I understand those points and can express them consistently.

&gt;I recognize, you will find fault with this, but I don't care. Because what you are finding fault with is not my arguments, but whether you can be made to think I care, when you are already looking for evidence that my emotional balance is either one side or another just to justify your own feelings.

&gt;That's about all I have to say on the matter.

Yet no such qualms exist if somebody wanted to get a boob job at 18 regardless of their mental health or confidence or anything like that.

An update on /r/abortion,"Hello everybody,

/r/abortion's top mod is currently automod.  I, for one, hail our new robot overlord.

However, every single other moderator on /r/abortion is somebody with professional or personal experience with abortion.

I'd like to thank a few people.

I'd like to thank the former top mod of /r/abortion.  Although we disagreed strenuously along the way, I think it should be applauded every time somebody decides to do the right thing.  It is hard for people to let go of power.

I'd like to thank Blue, who first recruited me to mod /r/abortion, and who came through in a big way.

I'd like to thank the amazing team that makes /r/abortion what it is.  In particular, I'd like to thank Pongo, without whose negotiation skills this wouldn't have happened.  However, every single member of that team played a role in helping keep us together in the last week, and of course they all play an amazing role in helping people access safe, well-informed abortions.

Finally, I'd like to thank all of you.

I don't think that this would have happened without the attention and scrutiny that this community brought to this issue.  You all called it like you saw it, and that resulted in a change in the world.

Remember that.  Out in the world there are ~8 tired, stressed people, most of whom spend all day helping people get abortions.  All we wanted to do was have relaxing evenings... also helping people get abortions.  And your outrage and communal voice made that happen.

Take a moment and think of what you can do in your other communities with that kind of power.

---

I'm locking comments on this post because the /r/prochoice mod team deserves a break.  (Did I say I was done thanking people?  I was lying.  Thank you to the /r/prochoice mod team, who handled an onslaught.)

As a Pro choicer I want to talk about pro choice arguments I don’t like,"There are so many strong arguments in support of abortion but I often see pro choice arguments that do not do a good job supporting abortion. I think that it’s important to be self aware as a community of our own flaws so this is why I’m making this post. So here are some arguments I don’t like and why I don’t like them

“The fetus is not alive”
The fetus is very much alive, saying it’s not does denies science and it doesn’t add anything to the argument. 

“Making abortions illegal will just cause unsafe abortions”
I promise you pro lifers do not care if women get injured having unsafe abortions so this argument helps their movement.

“Any mention of death penalty” 
The death penalty is a very separate issue and is not comparable to abortion in any way. I am very against the death penalty but that doesn’t make me a hypocrite for being prochoice. It’s a separate issue. 

These are the ones I could think of for now I want to hear other peoples thoughts on this as well.",t2_596vhsje,1622564097,prochoice
An update on /r/abortion,"Hello /r/prochoice,

I’m TrustedAdult, a physician who performs abortions.  I wanted to give everybody an update on what has been happening at /r/abortion, since many have reached out to ask.

**Background**

/r/abortion is the subreddit where people go to get advice when they’re having or seeking an abortion.  It’s also where people go when they need to talk about abortions they’ve had in the past if they’re having complicated feelings.

I’ve been contributing there for a long time; I think I became a mod there 3 years ago.  It’s a subreddit with a lot of transient users -- people who drift in, get the help they need, and drift back out.  Like other advice subs (like /r/LegalAdvice), a lot of the value of the sub is in the core group of people who hang around and give high-quality advice.

When I joined, the moderators were CedarWolf (“Cedar”) and Shill_of_Halliburton (“Shill”), as well as Bluefrost23 (""Blue"").  Shill and Cedar are the top mods at the center of this story.  Neither of them knows much about abortion.  Cedar mods 116 subreddits, mostly relating to transgender identity and furries.  Shill moderates 154 subreddits, mostly political (liberal) and relating to a certain fetish.  I can’t say how many of those subreddits they’re just squatting vs. how many involve active moderation.

According to Cedar, they claimed /r/abortion to keep trolls from getting it (eight years ago).  They had done nothing until Blue came in and started shaping it up, Blue then recruited me five years ago, when I was already active on there giving advice.  I was also active as a moderator, but the best thing I did was recruit a member of the Online Abortion Resource Squad.  Around two years ago, they brought on several moderators who were active, organized, and in excellent communication with each other.

Around the same time my work started getting busier and I had to take a break from Reddit for a bit.  When I got back, I was amazed to see that there were many people making highly informed and helpful comments about every aspect of seeking abortion care.  Gaps that I had in my knowledge regarding region-specific funds were being filled.  I didn’t have to look up every state’s policies on minors and judicial bypasses; these people knew already and were commenting before I could get there.

So this set of moderators includes a lot of people who can vouch for each other from meeting each other at conferences or having mutual friends.  But more importantly, we can all confirm the quality and accuracy of each other’s comments.

One change these moderators implemented was making a group chat for the active moderators to talk with each other.  This was good to flag posts like “this post needs immediate attention” and “this needs your expertise, not mine.”  Another was becoming firmer on the ""no articles"" policy -- having people hanging around /r/abortion to see the kinds of articles we see on /r/prochoice actually makes the sub worse, because then you get more inexperienced eyes helping out with people seeking help in complex situations.

The sub grew to around 30-50K unique visitors per month.  That's a lot of abortion support.  In my professional work as a physician, I actually saw a few patients who had gotten help on /r/abortion.  The relief it brought them brought me joy.  I care a lot about my patients.

**The Instigating Event**

After over a year of this, people started pointing out that having three inactive top mods was concerning for the sub.  Somebody tried the official Reddit process for removing top mods, which failed.  It may have been at that time that Cedar started taking cursory occasional moderator actions (clicking “approve” on posts from time to time).

A month ago, a reporter messaged the sub with questions, which happens from time to time.  Shill jumped in to give inaccurate responses without consulting the other mods. It bothered the active mods that an otherwise inactive mod who knew nothing about abortion was misrepresenting the subreddit to a reporter.

Neither Cedar nor Shill participated much in r/abortion when I joined, and neither of them participates much now. That’s actually for the best. On the few occasions that they have been active on the subreddit, Shill has posted misleading and hurtful comments that actively show their lack of experience communicating with people who are seeking abortion. Cedar has admitted that they cannot distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information about abortion.

To give you an idea of how inactive they are, of Cedar’s last 1000 comments and posts, just 5 of them were on r/abortion, and I believe that all of those were related to this fiasco. Redditsearch.io suggests that Cedar has made 3 comments on r/abortion, ever. We have been unable to identify any occasion when Cedar actually helped somebody get an abortion. In comparison, I have 6,832 comment karma on r/abortion. Of my last 1000 comments and posts, 416 of them were on r/abortion. Yet Cedar decided to kick me off the mod team and ban me from commenting over what they described as ""interpersonal drama"" (translation: valid concerns about the impact of the two inactive top mods) 

So it bothered moderators to have inactive mods communicating on behalf of this sub, and also has always raised anxieties that we're building on an unstable foundation.  After some discussion, I messaged Cedar, expressing the mod team’s concerns about having inactive mods at the top of the roster.  I wanted to know their thoughts on retiring the inactive moderators, including themselves.  Cedar was initially open, saying that they had also been thinking of removing Shill (they’ve never explained why), but that they disliked that so much happened on moderator chat.  I started a new chat to invite them to, that would include all the mods, not just active mods.  We agreed that they would remove Shill and I would start a moderator subreddit as they requested; they felt decisions would be better-made there.

Cedar also expressed concerns that we were anti-trans and/or anti-men, based on a half-remembered comment (that they said they might be misremembering) by a member of the active mod team that they had made over a year ago.  This came up multiple times and Cedar never was able to provide a link to it.

Cedar also expressed a desire to take the sub in a different direction, that they wanted it to be “more of a resource” for people seeking information on abortion, that it would include articles… mind you, this person has been a mod of /r/abortion for 8 years.  They could have done this at any time.  Only now, that /r/abortion is thriving as a resource, do they want to try to implement their vision instead.  Incorporating political articles on a support sub weakens it as a support sub.  The mod team is unanimous (except Cedar and Shill) on this.

I started the private moderator subreddit as they requested and then my work got very busy and I didn’t get around to inviting people.  Cedar reneged on removing Shill as a mod.

**The Purge**

A little over two weeks later, Cedar, with no announcement or discussion with any of the mods, removed over half of the modlist.  Subsequent chats with Cedar were interesting.

They said that we were running the sub badly, that we were cliquey and backstabby (et tu, Brute?).  They said that they were tired of getting requests to remove Shill, and also claimed that people had made requests to remove me and that we, the active mods, often message Cedar complaining about other active mods.  They never provided evidence to substantiate these claims.

They said that we (the removed moderators) were welcome to reapply as moderators, and that the community would vote on who would be moderators.  This and other comments they made were very tone-deaf about the nature of /r/abortion.  They also seemed not to understand why professional people volunteering their time and expertise are hesitant to engage with Cedar’s plan.

Why would we be hesitant?  A few reasons.  Cedar, by doing this, showed their willingness to intermittently engage in autocratic behavior.  Other than Cedar and Shill, everybody on the moderator team opposed these interventions.  100% everybody.  For us, the active moderators, investing our time and energy on something Cedar is willing to destroy on a whim… that’s discouraging, to say the least.

Another reason is that Cedar was saying that they would need some kind of proof that those of us with medical expertise actually have that expertise.  They suggested I submit an image of my medical license “with the identifying parts covered.”  That would either be no proof at all (because I can print out a medical license for any state and cover the identifying parts) or would be doxxing.  This is showing both their ignorance and how little thought they put into this.  They have admitted that they are unable to distinguish between good and bad advice the way we are.

Strangely, when pressed on why they were credentialed to be the top moderator, Cedar cited their experience being a security guard in juvenile detention.  “I’m a protector,” they wrote, of their experience being an instrument of state violence against children.  Then they wrote that they felt they had to protect people seeking abortion… from us, the active mods.

Cedar wrote many other strange things in that chat, but they were clear on one thing: that a large factor in the removal from the mod team was retribution for people having requested that they be removed as a top moderator.

Cedar has instituted changes that are harmful to the sub.  We have actively discouraged people getting help and advice by direct messages because we cannot review those; Cedar has removed this discouragement and expressed (in chat) that they think it’s fine and that they have often done this themselves.  We have blocked the posting of articles because these often contain misleading titles.  Cedar allowed it and Shill promptly posted an article that made it sound like abortion is currently illegal in Texas (it’s not!) and then claimed that it *was* when corrected.

We (the former mod team) are continuing to participate because of the risk of people getting inaccurate answers; we continue to be the main source of accurate answers on /r/abortion.

**My Ban**

Cedar made a total of three posts requesting people apply to be moderators.  On the first one, somebody asked in comments that Cedar post their own filled-out application.  Cedar first shadow-removed a lot of comments, then took down the whole post and reposted it.  On the new one, I commented:

&gt; Hi there! Strange to see that this was removed and reposted.

&gt; For those of us considering applying to mod, can you tell us a little bit about your qualifications? Or how you intend to vet the qualifications of mods who are applying?”

I was banned from /r/abortion for that comment.  Cedar took down the post and put it back up with comments disabled, saying people should apply through the moderator chat.  Cedar has also banned other of the qualified frequent commenters who were members of the mod team.

Since being banned, multiple people have wound up chatting and/or messaging me for advice because of seeing my comment history in /r/abortion.  I would normally be helping them in the comments there.  It’s very frustrating that Cedar is willing to weaken the actual ability of /r/abortion to help people because they feel personally slighted that the active moderators question their authority.

Cedar has told me in chat that they have reached out to professional organizations requesting they provide somebody to volunteer their time like I’ve been doing.  This includes organizations of which I’m a member, at least one leader of which has described Cedar’s request as “completely silly.”

**Moving Forward**

We’ve requested admin intervention but have been declined.  This is surprising to me because the [top mod removal process](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal) doesn’t define “inactive mod,” but does make it clear that retribution isn’t allowed, and makes it clear that consensus is important.  We have complete consensus that Cedar and Shill should be removed, and we have admission to retribution, but the admins are not acting.

It’s a sad situation.  I’ve asked Cedar several times if they have any insight into the fact that everybody thinks they’re doing the wrong thing, but they don’t seem to have any insight into that.  I hope that they realize they’re weakening the sub and change their course of action, but as long as they stay as top mod some of the damage will remain.

Until Cedar booted us, the active mods were a group of people with experience being pregnant, having abortions, and parenting, people who work in abortion funding, advocacy, and research, and abortion providers. We have knowledge that covers different regions and countries. This set of moderators includes a lot of people who can vouch for each other from meeting each other at conferences or having mutual friends. But more importantly, we can all confirm the quality and accuracy of the support we provided on the sub. Contrary to Cedar's assertion that we needed an intervention to function as a team, we really loved working together to make the subreddit a supportive and informative place. We did our best to recognize our limits, check one another, and step in for each other when we were out of our depth, and now we're trying to deal with the aftermath of Cedar kicking us off the subreddit.

We're evaluating all of our options and will keep /r/prochoice updated.",t2_biuho,1622504289,prochoice

the issue with the “potential life” argument,"I was watching a debate yesterday between a pro lifer and a pro-choicer and the pro lifer decided to bring up potential life. They said that since the ZEF has the potential to become a fully grown and fully developed human that will eventually have the same rights as all other living breathing humans in society, that it (from conception) has the “right to life” as stated in the declaration of independence. The pro-choicer then responded to that argument by saying because an 18-year-old has the potential to one day become 21 and gain the right to legally drink alcohol that the 18-year-old should be able to drink alcohol at 18 because they have the potential to become 21. obviously this argument is slightly different because everyone’s definition of personhood and when the ZEF becomes a “person” with the same rights as all other living breathing developed people in society will never be the same. I love this counter argument because I personally believe that the ZEF becomes a person with human rights when it can both survive on its own and has brain activity. nonetheless I do fully support the right to abortion whenever the mother decides because I believe in my body my choice.",t2_7m2kvpq8,1622484299,prochoice

Online discussion 6/5 - Abortion the Right to Life vs. the Right to Bodily Autonomy," Join the Virtual Philosophy Network [https://discord.gg/UjYyK5gUKe](https://discord.gg/UjYyK5gUKe) for a philosophically-oriented discussion about the abortion debate.

Now that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear an abortion case challenging Roe v. Wade, let's have an open discussion of the abortion debate from a philosophical perspective, focusing on (but not confined) to Judith Jarvis Thomson's famous ""violinist"" argument.

In the book and movie My Sister’s Keeper, Anna, who was conceived as a “savior sibling” in order to provide her sick sister, Kate, with genetically compatible bone-marrow, seeks medical emancipation from her parents so that she does not have to donate a kidney to her sister. She argues that her right to control what happens to her body is just as important as Kate’s right to continue living.

In 1971, philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson wrote a strange thought-experiment that is similar to Anna’s scenario in an attempt to argue in favor of the moral right to an abortion. Thomson asks  
the reader to imagine that you have been kidnapped by the Society of Music Lovers in order to “hook up” your circulatory system to an ailing violinist, in the hopes that your kidneys will successfully extract  
poisons from his blood. The doctor apologizes for your kidnapping, but tells you that if you disconnect yourself from the violinist now, he will surely die.

Thomson argues that you are not morally required to stay “hooked up.” While it would be exceedingly nice of you to do so, it is not something you are morally obligated to do, even if it costs the violinist’s life. It’s not that the violinist’s life is not valuable, or that he lacks a right to life, it’s that one person’s right to life does not entail that another person is obligated to use their body to sustain that life. Thomson uses this analogy to argue that even if we assume that fetuses are persons with a right to life (a common pro-life assertion), this alone is insufficient for concluding that a woman can be compelled to use her body to sustain its life. Just like Kate’s right to life does not obligate Anna to continue donating bone marrow or a kidney, and just like you are not obligated to stay “hooked up” to the violinist, women are not obligated to remain pregnant in order to sustain fetal life.

Not everyone wants to have sex. Not every sperm needs to fertilize an egg. Not every fetus needs to develop into a baby.

The big difference between regretting having an abortion and regretting the situation that lead a women to abortion.,"This is a difficult place to be. I don’t regret having an abortion 2 years ago, it was the best decision I could make and I’m a better person for making this decision. I can finish my degree, date without the burden of being a young mum and haven’t been shunned by my family. 

And yet occasionally I feel sad, I want to be a mother one day, and as I get older (I guess hormones take over) the idea of motherhood appeals more and more to me. I like the idea of having a child- but in the best environment. 

Having an abortion is never an easy decision, but again the end of the day a person must make the most responsible decision.

When pro lifers peddle this “women always regret abortion” myth, they don’t take into account that women don’t regret the abortion they regret finding themselves in an undesirable situation. 

That said I wish there was a more open discussion regarding the negative effects of abortion, even though it may have been the best decision. It’s a hard thing to go through",t2_55y1c84t,1622076811,prochoice

Things won't magically work out for every teenage parent. It is naive to suggest they will.," 

There is an a post on the forced birth sub about a young woman who is doing well after having a b

And of course, it is all about how SEE, YOU CAN MAKE HAVING A BABY AT 14 WORK WITHOUT BABY MURDER.

Ok, but when you go and read the article, tucked in like a minor detail is that the girl’s mother quit her job to look after the baby so the teenage mother could finish school. That is not a minor detail at all. Without that, this mother would have all but certainly been another teen mom high school drop out statistic. 

If I got pregnant as a teenager, my mother wouldn’t have give up her career to watch the baby, and nor should she have to. She’d have encouraged abortion but let me make my own decision. She’d have taken me for the abortion and paid for it if I chose that, but made it clear that if I got pregnant and chose to keep and raise the baby, she’d be a loving grandmother, but I’d be the one who has to get up through the night to deal with the baby and I’d be the one who has to find child care for it because she couldn’t afford to quit work and watch the baby so I could finish school. And fair enough. My mother and father were in their 40s when I was a teenager. They couldn’t afford to retire or take big career break in their 40s to handle a mistake I made. 

The woman in the article says “But as soon as I came home \[from school\] she handed him back to me. She never let me forget that it was my responsibility to look after him” as if that changes things. It doesn’t really. She still got 7 hours a day of free childcare that enabled her to finish school and that most teenage parents don’t get. 

Now, I’m not criticising this girl because her mother did that for her. That was her family’s decision and her mother had every right to choose to help her child in that way, but it was never an obligation and it can’t be expected of every parent of a pregnant teenage girl. And glossing over that and pretending everyone can have a baby at 13/14 and end up at University is incredibly naive.",t2_c6a2bdzj,1622010458,prochoice

I'm currently on the fence between pro-life and pro-choice; however, I have one question: how does consent to sex not mean consent to pregnancy? Now I'm not talking about times that the woman can't control it (such as rape), but when the woman is agreeing to having sex and knows the risks of pregnancy it just doesn't make logical sense to me how she isn't agreeing that she may become pregnant.

You won't keep your memories or anything else that makes you ""you"" and you'll basically have to start from scratch, but you will live to your normal life expectancy. The child giving birth won't have to raise any children of their own after birth. There's still a chance that they do it without coercion.

I'm sick of people who compare abortions to the Holocaust,"I'm definitely going to put a trigger warning here just in case anyone gets triggered by this since I do mention H\^tler and the N\^zis. Just a warning for anyone easily triggered.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) = source for information

I'm not Jewish and I'm disgusted by people who make the argument. I don't even think most people who use that as an argument are even Jewish, perhaps not even educated on the subject.

Maybe a pro-lifer would say something like ""abortion is the new Holocaust because it's about killing humans they thought that were inhuman"".

First off, that's just wrong. Fetuses aren't sent to concentration camps because they're believed to be a ""threat to society"" or some shit. [Yes, H\^tler did believe that Jews were an aberration](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/why-did-hitler-hate-jews/), but people don't get abortions because they think babies are an aberration? Hell, asking someone why they got an abortion sounds so disrespectful. It could be a result of their personal trauma.

I'm a little bit of an Antinatalist; I do believe adoption is the better option since the world is overpopulated and not much people are doing anything about it instead of having more babies, but I can't force people to get an abortion or not. Why else is it called pro-choice?

There was a post on the prolife subreddit awhile ago about how someone thinks that abortion clinics are the equivalent to N\^zi concentration camps (by the way it always also a cringe Joker meme, of course it was bad). I don't get it...? They're not sent to hours and days of labor with no food or water and then shot.

I have a feeling pro-lifers are going to argue with that, saying ""well the murder part is the same"". I personally don't believe abortion is murder (hence why I'm pro-choice all the way), but maybe even if you did believe it, is comparing it to a massive genocide that [claimed the lives of about six million Jews](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/documenting-numbers-of-victims-of-the-holocaust-and-nazi-persecution) and traumatized more even okay?

[Not to mention that H\^tler and the N\^zis didn't just murder Jews, they also murdered millions of Soviet citizens and prisoners, hundreds to thousands of LGBTQ+ people, criminal offenders and asocials, and much more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

I don't care if you think abortion is murder or not. Comparing abortions to the Holocaust, something that traumatized millions and killed millions more, is not okay. If you think that abortions are the new Holocaust, shut up. I can't even describe how messed up you sound.

""But that child could've cured cancer and ended WWIII!"" Anyone can, stop guilt tripping people.

How do you feel about males having the freedom to choose?,"Obviously males can't control whether or not you carry the fetus to term, but if the woman chooses to have the baby without the father's consent, he ought to be free to choose to not pay child support. 9 times out of 10 that's really what young fathers want to avoid. Because males don't get pregnant that's the only cost we incur.

I'm 100% pro-choice so why does the concept of male reproductive rights still seem so fringe amongst these communities?

I understand it's technically possible to sign away parental rights, but in most US states males require a *judge's* consent to do so, once again taking away the father's freedom to choose for himself. If that judge is also male, it's virtually guaranteed he will force the male to pay the woman for 18 years. I also understand that occasionally women don't demand child support from males but that's certainly not the norm. I'm only talking about the US btw.

Freedom to choose doesn't mean freedom from responsibility. If a woman choose to not get an abortion, and the male asked her to and was willing to pay for half, he should not be legally liable to pay 18 years of child support.",t2_15eh44,1621774888,prochoice

The way that I see it is that abortion is pretty much just self defense,"Okay so let me explain. If someone is infringing on your body in a harmful way you have the right to stop it in any way possible. If someone has a knife to your throat or is raping you then you can kill them if that’s what it takes to get them to stop. Now even though people understand this concept they don’t accept that abortion is the same sort of thing because of the fact that the fetus is “innocent” and the person trying to stab you and rape you are not “innocent” however if you kill someone for trying to stab you, you aren’t killing them because they are “not innocent” you are killing them because you are trying to protect your body. For example It is illegal to kill your rapist a week after they rape u even though they are “a bad person” you are only able to kill them if it means protecting your body. 

SO basically to sum it up. Abortion is the same as self defense. Someone is infringing on your body and you are allowed to do whatever to stop  them. The reason people do not understand this is because they don’t understand that self defense is not about whether the person is innocent or not and is about defending your body.",t2_596vhsje,1621725723,prochoice

I'm a badass capable of doing anything I choose to set my mind to.......but motherhood is not a project I'm interested in taking on.","The anti-choice movement acts like women who ""turn desperately to abortion"" just haven't been empowered enough and given the right support to keep their babies and enjoy motherhood, and it makes me roll my eyes so hard. Apparently we need to be told we are ""strong enough"" to keep our unplanned pregnancies and blah blah fucking blah.

The problem is not that I am ""not strong enough"" to cope with adversity. I graduated law school and passed the bar just 5 months after my father died and while working a part time job. I have dealt with many difficult situations in my life.

**I just don't WANT to be a mother.**

Simple as that. 

I'm childfree but I don't look down on Motherhood and mothers. It is a lot of work and basically like having a full time unpaid job with no sick leave or vacation no matter how much you need a break. I have a lot of respect for those who commit to it and do it well. But it is not for me. There is nothing Anti-choicers could offer me that would make me change my mind. Free childcare and parenting classes and maternity leave won't change my mind because I don't want to be a mother. You could offer me a $250k cheque and a guarantee my career would not suffer to keep an unplanned pregnancy and I'd STILL get an abortion because that is how little pregnancy and motherhood appeals to me. I don't wish children harm, but I don't particularly enjoy being around children, and would go out of my mind having to live with a child in my home and be responsible for it 24/7. It is not for me. I'm not the type who will be fulfilled by staying home with a child getting into Montessori and implementing #montessoritoddler at home. My best friend is like that right now and loves it, and good for her. She is happy being a mom and I'm happy she loves being a mom. I would be miserable being a mom, and my best friend understands that. She openly tells people ""I love my daughter and have no regrets but is so much harder than I expected, don't do it unless you are 100% sure you are ready to make a lot of sacrifices in every other aspect of your life"".

The after effects of having conceived with a fake or ‘conditional’ pro-lifer,"this is going to be *long* because I’m tired of being quiet on it being told I made the wrong/right choice. And funnily enough, I feel like would be an understanding place. I’m not even sure if this is allowed, but I thought it was worth a shot at communicating with others.

So before I start, let me preface by saying I’ve never sided with one side of the argument over the other. I think both sides can be rational, but I’ve never felt strongly on it. I just knew what choice I would make if I ever got pregnant unintentionally, but would never impose that on others. Although this entire experience has definitely made me a little resentful of anyone claiming to be pro-life... But I’m trying to clear the blanket vision I have.

But one point I always saw from the pro-choice side was “It’s immoral until its convenient for them.” And I thought that was such a garbage argument, because nobody is capable of that level of hypocrisy... and then I met one :) we’re starting from the beginning.

Let’s call this guy John. John was very conservative, and had a lot of strong opinions on things that I didn’t, including being pro-life. Which is perfectly fine with me. He seemed nice and respectful, so it really didn’t bother me. I talked with him for about 3-4 months, but we never made plans to meet until the end, mostly because we both worked 6 days a week, 12 hour shifts and lived 1 1/2 apart. But finally our schedule matched and we planned to meet.

Side note : I never initiated or encouraged sexual conversation. He would make snide comments sometimes but I would just laugh it off and carry on with something else. The week we planned to meet was a rough one for both of us and I was under guise that we would relax and talk more, because I told him how much I hated talking through text, but he also hated speaking on the phone. I never had intentions of showing up to sleep with him. Maybe that was my bad. Hookups and casual sex were just... never my thing. I hate it. Anyways.

I show up, and as soon as we get the greetings out of the way, he starts pouring drinks. I’m still not exactly sure what it was. He didn’t let me see the bottles. I’ve always been very good at knowing when my limit to alcohol is. I blacked out once and never wanted to do it again, so by no means am I expert, but I usually know myself well enough to cut if off.

I’m only 2 drinks in, and I’m already feeling like garbage.. A type of awful I’ve never felt from drinking so little before. I tell him I’m done and he pours me another ‘just in case’ but I felt so bad I just remember sitting it down and not touching it. At this point he’s just finished one. He tells me he’s going to order a pizza, and I sit on the edge of the bed and start playing on my phone to try and bring myself back down... But everything after that (about 7pm) to around 3:30am is totally and utterly blank. I woke up, he’s gone, my phone is dead, and there’s still my untouched drink on the bedside table. I get up and plug my phone in, and find he sent me text around 8:30pm saying the alcohol caused him to have a panic attack and he went home.

I still felt so sick I ended up crawling back in bed and falling asleep for 3 more hours. I was still too dizzy to drive. After I get home, I asked him what the hell happened. He says he doesn’t remember. He was too drunk. At the time I didn’t question it because I really didn’t want to explore the territory that conversation probably would’ve led to. He tells me we just kept talking and that’s all he remember. I wanted to question how he could not remember what happened, but be sober enough not only to drive himself home, but send me a lengthy text telling me why he left and that the room was paid for up until the morning, but I didn’t and I kept talking to him like nothing happened. I also feel like it’s important to note I woke up fully dressed and tucked into bed. There was no inclination that I anything had happened.

Well, a month goes by, we’ve planned to meet up on Halloween, but something comes up and he cancels. Okay. Cool. Another week passes and I realize I haven’t been feeling the greatest and I’ve definitely slowed down at work. And then it occurs to me I’m late. I take a test just as a precautionary, fully expecting it to be negative...

No. Very clear positive. Three different tests. I immediately call him and once again ask him what happened that night but he still swears he can’t remember. I tell him well there’s three positive tests sitting on my bathroom sink that might help paint it a little better for the both of us.. He asked if I’d slept with anyone else. Hard no. I barely had time to keep up with him, let alone anyone else. He tells me ‘Well I don’t want kids.” and tell him neither do I, but that’s kind of not an option at the moment. He goes really quiet. And then tells me he’ll pay for half. I get really confused for a second, but then he tells me to hang up the phone, call the nearest clinic, get a quote, and make an appointment and he’ll cover half. I was in such shock at the moment I just said “okay” and hung up the phone.

I never called a clinic. I never even looked for one. I spend the next week in complete silence, only telling a close friend of mine, and trying to figure out what the hell I’m about to do. Because all of sudden, this guy who was preaching baby murder and pro-life last week, is telling someone not only do they need to go get the very thing they claimed to be so against, but also telling her she has to help cover the costs, and endure it by herself.

At the end of the week he texts me asking about the situation. I’m still extremely distraught and tell him i don’t know. He tells me ‘well if you decide not to terminate, forget my name and face. And if you try to come for child support I’ll go for full custody’ Yes. That is almost word for word. I still have all of our text messages, and a few screenshots of the pro-life posts before he got some brains and deleted them.

Well. I’m now 34 weeks along. A little girl. She has a name... and while I don’t regret my choice, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t resentful. I’ve struggled with my health this entire pregnancy. This week I was put on bed rest after being out of work for a week due to my declining and health, but I wasn’t put on bed rest until all my tests came back and I kept getting sent home from work because I wasn’t able to do the tasks they wanted me to do. I don’t have family, and I haven’t reached out to the dad, because that’s not a level of stress I can handle right now, nor do I think he’d give any sort of a fuck. Luckily my job offers a pretty lengthy maternity leave that’s fully paid that I can start at any time, but the company has been dragging their feet on approving it and keep sending the paperwork back to my doctor. And even when it doesn’t get approved, my first paycheck will only be half of what it should be because they have a 7 day payment wait period after the initial approval.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So... now I’m at risk of losing everything. I wish I was exaggerating. I have 1 half day worked on my upcoming check, and it was my ‘bills’ check. My car is nearly paid off, and I’ve never made a late payment.. bc if it’s 2 days late it’s automatically on a repo list. I’ve called them and tried to explain the situation but there’s essentially nothing they can do unless I go in and ‘alter’ my contract, which I can’t do because the dealership I got it from is a 3 and a half hour drive away. I don’t have the gas money for that, nor do I think it’s a good idea to drive that far by myself at 34 weeks pregnant. My apartment is very strict with late payments, so there’s the impending threat of eviction if I make my rent too late, my internet and phone are being shut off in a few days, which is going to make communicating with my doctors impossible. I’m supposed to be checking my blood pressure every single day, multiple times a day, because it’s suddenly very high, but I can’t afford to purchase an at home cuff so I just have to wait until my next appointments and hope for the best. They fear preeclampsia. I don't have money to eat. Which is extra terrible because one of the issues we're having is, is she isn't growing like she should. She's small.

Even if I get my leave approved asap, the next paycheck wont be enough to cover all of this, since it’s only half. I don’t get assistance from the government because technically, I make too much. I have plenty of income to support me and her, but then with the added expense of trying to get all the things I need for her (i still don’t have nearly everything i need in that aspect either...), and my restricted ability to work, I feel... extremely stressed and angry. Not only by my finical situation, but by the fact that I’ve had to endure this completely by myself, cover every bit of the cost, because some guy thinks his morals only apply to other people, and as soon as it affects him, he had no issues willing to break those morals, and trying to decline any responsibility.

My mind wanders to adoption sometimes, but then I immediately remind myself that that wouldn’t solve anything.. I’m still carrying her. I’m still sick because I’m carrying her. The only way to avoid this would’ve been to terminate, which was not an option for me at all. Despite the sketchy circumstances of which she was conceived, I still love her, and look forward to meeting her, but right now it’s extremely hard, and I’m terrified of failing her.

I hold no anger towards pro-lifers as a whole, but it’s left a sour taste in my mouth knowing such hypocrisy does exist, but I also realize it exists everywhere, and I feel incredibly stupid I had to find out in this way. I know my choice is not the choice everyone here would've made, but.... I didn't think it was possible to be this bad.",t2_4b0lb1zk,1621641538,prochoice

I just don’t get it. If you think a baby is a baby at 7 months why are you okay with someone else saying partial birth is okay?

If you think it is wrong at 9 weeks why is it okay to let someone else do it at 10?

What I believe is irrelevant to this post all I know is that I believe it is awful for anyone to have an abortion so much as a day after I think it’s okay. What’s to stop someone from saying “this defenseless newborn isn’t really a person yet so I can just toss him in the dumpster?”

As a teenager who doesn't get upset about stuff it makes me so scared knowing that if I got pregnant I'd need to be considered mature before getting an abortion when the whole need for an abortion is because I'm not mature. The whole fact that people might be able to legally force beliefs on you is terrifying.

What do you think about men who claim to 'grieve' that their partner got an abortion?,"There's a recent post on the pro life sub about a man who says that when he was a teenager, he got his girlfriend pregnant. He told her he wanted to keep it, but she got an abortion and told him it was a miscarriage. He says that this made him extremely depressed and he ended up turning to alcohol to cope with his grief.

What are y'alls opinions on this? I don't want to downplay his grief, because I know it can be extremely hard emotionally to lose a pregnancy to miscarriage, so I suppose it makes sense that a man would grieve if his partner got an abortion against his wishes. But at the same time, the post made me deeply uncomfortable to read. This guy seemed to feel he had a scary level of entitlement to his ex girlfriend's body. He just immediately assumed that she was going to carry the pregnancy to term, and started planning how he would be able to financially support her and the baby without asking what her feelings were on it.

My feeling is that situations like this are the result of men being raised to believe they have a certain entitlement to womens' bodies. This guy inseminated his girlfriend and then just expected her to be willing to gestate his offspring. I always find it slightly hypocritical when pro life men get upset about their partners having abortions. They're usually the ones saying women should close their legs if they don't want to be pregnant- well, surely they should take it upon themselves not to inseminate women if they aren't prepared for the possibility of her not wanting to give birth to the baby?",t2_8lje7nkm,1621543956,prochoice
Confession- I'd rather die than be pregnant,"Trigger warning 

I am really scared and suicidal. My mental health has been worse since this week's news cycle. I feel silly that I'm this worked up, I never wanted kids. I've always been horrified at the thought of being pregnant. All I heard growing up from women in my life how hellish pregnancy was for them and how painful being a woman, wife, and mother is.   


I am an adult American woman, disabled, have chronic illness and several friends who I've judged for having abortions. I'm fairly pro life but I just keep thinking ""what if I end up pregnant like my other female friends?"" (Some of them who were raped or in violent situations and had an abortion)  


But today I also stand with women and young girls as the bills go to the supreme court. Why? Because Pro birthers don't care. They don't care about the death penalty. They don't care that the US has no maternity leave. They don't care unless women and girls are fufilling their roles as mothers and baby makers for America.  


You can be dying, screaming for a right to have complete control of your body, but they don't care. They don't care if you dont have access to birth control. They dont care if you or I are raped. They only care if they can get a baby from you while bleeding and screaming on an operating table. 

I feel like I'm being overdramatic but deep down I know I am not. I am absolutely terrified to have been born a female. And I am terrified to be an American today because all my rights are being debated and I am not there to speak.",t2_c0qlsx9u,1621536461,prochoice

The movie Unplanned really tries to emotionally manipulate the audience,"I don’t remember if I made a similar or the same post before on here but I gotta say:

Unplanned actively engages in a black and white view of it all, and presents PP as the worst of the worst. Above that they use a Catholic organization (even though many catholic organizations from my experience in being a now ex Catholic tend to be very selfish and only help other Catholics and not donate to any other organization that isn’t Catholic). It’s sorta crazy how they apply the story of this chick, Abby who got accidental pregnancy and never touch on rape, I don’t even think for one second rape pregnancy was even uttered. And this is how I feel this movie tries to make the audience forget about, and then basically show graphic (and highly scientifically inaccurate) imagery. They even showed abortion for one chick, and we literally didn’t even touch up on her after the abortion, only before, and actively try to make it sound as painful as possible. While they may have a FEW facts here and there the main thing is that they actively try to touch on your emotional heart strings but under it all it literally says “if we give women a choice then the main option would be abortion so we shouldn’t.” 

And the fact is, I think in the movie the main character was PC..? But then had like ZERO PC ideals besides “well women should have a choice”. The main character from my memory never even presented keeping the baby, that means the main character was pro abortion, not PC. PCS should and do present both options and leave it up to the chick. This is just such a heavily biased movie, i absolutely hate it. It genuinely manipulates and lies to its audience just so they can side with them emotionally..",t2_52dga8il,1621431927,prochoice

I just need to rant (Tik Tok account @TheDeathscorts),"If you don’t know, there is a Tik Tok account of a clinic escort for an independent abortion clinic in Omaha, Nebraska. At this clinic, the escorts are allowed to interact (verbally) with the protesters. In fact,I don’t know about this account because it was in a post in this sub several months ago. I’ve been through their account, and it’s pretty disgusting.

There are people on ladders shouting at these women. There was on video of a man yelling at a car leaving the parking lot saying that the woman was a “horrible person”. There is always a same group of protesters. They show pictures of aborted fetuses, and in one Tik Tok, a woman with a child in her car drove in, and asked the protester to hide the graphic picture of the fetus because it was upsetting her child, but the protester held it closer. The tactics they use are disgusting. There is a someone in scrubs claiming to be a nurse and another person saying he is the doctor (he has a PhD in physics, so he isn’t technically impersonating at “doctor”), saying that they have to do an emergency ultrasound at the Crisis Pregnancy Center, even though the abortion clinic does them. One of the protesters has made a vest that looks almost identical to the actual vests the clinic uses. They have a booth saying that the patient has to “check in”. When a car pulls up and the protesters say they work there, the actual escorts say that they don’t actually work there. The protesters yell, “We can help you!” The protesters direct the woman to the CPC down the road. When the escort goes to the CPC with a protester (the protester claimed that a medical professional worked there), the escort found out the CPC *wasn’t even open.* They also block the driveway, which, but the way, is illegal. They have had to call the cops before to get them off the road. The escorts use a megaphone to make noise over the protesters.

If you watch their Tik Toks, the escort basically treats the protesters as toddlers. The protesters have a ladder, and the escort tells them to get off the ladder. The escorts tell the protesters that they were not going to yell that day. On one occasion, during the Winter and there was snow on the ground, a car came into the clinic to ask for directions, and the protesters basically started yelling at them to not have an abortion (even though they were not there for one), and the escort told the protesters that they were not even there for an abortion.

I think @TheDeathscorts on Tik Tok bring awareness to these “pro-lifers” and how horrible they act, claiming they “save lives,” even though the escort that has the account says that no woman has actually not had an abortion because of them. Just wanted to tell you guys the stories.

My due date was yesterday...,"I was given a due date of May 17th 2021. 

At the time I was married but seperated and going through a divorce. After 15 years of being ""infertile"" I got pregnant the very first time I had sex w a new partner after my husband and I separated. The guy and I weren't even officially dating yet. He was in college with no job or money. My job offered no health insurance. I was denied government assistance. Florida law could have  forced me to wait until I gave birth to finalize divorce making my ex husband the legal father until we filed the paperwork and completed a dna test. Or I could have lied during divorce hearing and risked prison for 5 years. My newborns first days would have literally been a custody battle with someone not even related or aware I was pregnant. Most of my friends abandoned me after divorce, people took his side. My mom committed suicide in 2014 and my dad said ""you owe me money, dont think just because you got pregnant you dont and dont expect any help from me."" The guy (now boyfriend) begged and pleaded for me to keep it but I was so miserable I wanted to kill myself. I got so sick and suicidal. So I got the abortion. I went septic 7 days later. I almost died and 9 months later I am still suffering physical and mental complications. 

But the only thing that got me through all that was me sobbing on the phone with my best friend 7 months after the abortion as I am shitting blood and puking, down to 95lbs from being so sick and malnourished... ""if there is a God he is punishing me for what I did!"" And my friend said ""There is a God and he is just telling you to keep the next one... and it will be perfect.""

Do I fall more in the pro life or pro choice camp?,"1) I believe there is a difference between killing someone and not saving them

2) I am a Muslim and I believe that after 120 days is the hard line as after this point the fetus has a soul. Therefore, it would be murder after this point for the most part unless in exceptional circumstances.

""By 120 days from conception,[8] the scholars of all schools unanimously agree that ensoulment has taken place. This is based on a tradition in which the Prophet ﷺ mentions that the angel breathes the soul into the fetus by 120 days. However, Muslim scholars do not necessarily equate ensoulment with the completion of embryogenesis (i.e., takhalluq). Some scholars, such as the thirteenth century Ibn az-Zamlakâni (d. 727H, may Allah bestow mercy on him), maintained that embryogenesis is almost completed, according to the prophetic traditions, by the fortieth or forty-second day of conception[9] (54-56 days of gestational age). The soul would then descend in a body ready to receive it, just as it departs from it when it is not suitable to harbor it. Allah says in the Qur'an, “Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.” [al-Mu’minoon (23): 12-14]

The Arabic article thumma (then), which refers to succession with delay, is used in the above verses to separate between the stages of embryogenesis and the “development into another creation.” This is what has been reported by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and believed widely to be a reference to the ensoulment phase.[10] In addition, in the verse above, the formation of bones and their enclosure with flesh is mentioned between the first stages of development and the reference to ensoulment.

Aborting the pregnancy becomes categorically forbidden at this point, as the embryo is now a fully sanctified human life. Islamically speaking, this would be murder—unless a physician determines that continuing the pregnancy would truly endanger the mother’s life. Only in this case can the pregnancy be terminated after 120 days. The logic behind this is an agreed upon legal maxim in Islamic law: certainty should not be overridden by doubt. In other words, a potential life (that of the infant) should not threaten a stable life (that of the mother). Although both are technically alive, the survival of the mother takes precedence because her life is evidently established, while survival of the fetus within her is relatively more doubtful. Hence, doubt is trumped by certainty, and the lesser harm is endured to avoid the greater loss. Jurists also support this from another angle; the mother is the origin of the infant, so even if they have equal possibility of surviving, as long as the fetus is part of her and dependent on her, you don’t cut the root to save the branch. When forced to choose, the branch should be sacrificed to save the root""

Source: https://yaqeeninstitute.org/omar-suleiman/islam-and-the-abortion-debate

To summarize:

""During the first 40 days after conception, the majority permitted abortion only when the two spouses mutually agreed, and for clearly legitimate reasons (such as rape, and the physical or mental inability to raise children).""

""After the first 40 days to 120 days it is only permitted  when a pressing need is present (such as rape, or an extreme fetal deformity incompatible with life). After 120 days is when it would be straight up murder unless the mother's life is in peril.""

Note economic reasons are not acceptable to have an abortion and if the mother wants an abortion but not the father then an abortion is not allowed (unless the mother's life is threatened) and the child can go to the father or something.

So am I more in the pro choice or pro life camp lol?

Medically Necessary Clause?,"The news about the SCOTUS situation is definitely upsetting. I have a few questions that I was wondering if anyone here may know the answer to. 

Would this bill, if passed, ban all abortions unless they are deemed necessary to save the life of the mother?

If so, what will be stopping compassionate and decent doctors from simply stating that for any woman with any autoimmune, chronic, or mental illness, that the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother? Technically any pregnancy could have deadly complications at any moment for any reason. It's only increased in the case of autoimmune/chronic/mental illness, in addition to driving up to suicide rates. 

Most anyone can easily get a mental illness diagnosis, even if they just spout off the right symptoms to a doctor. I think this would be the perfect loophole for essentially negating the bill - after all, doctors are the ones who decide if something is needed to save the life of the mother. 

Could we work on a coalition of doctors and make a list of doctors that are willing to be decent, compassionate people, and seen any abortion necessary to save the life of the mother in a roundabout way?",t2_a8c7j2gt,1621362223,prochoice

Why I think Pro-lifers are guilty of creating pregnancy inspo-porn,"Inspiration porn is a term in which stories of disabled people persevering or achieving things are held up as inspiring because of their disability, which some disabled people feel is condescending. Even more relevant to this topic is the inspirational disabled people are the most visible in society, creating false impressions of what particular conditions look like. 
And when it comes to difficult pregnancies prolifers seem particularly fond of portraying only the ""inspirational pregnancies"". The ones where women minimize their pain and there is always a good outcome, no matter the typical odds in that situation.

Consider the story of Saint Gianna Beretta Molla. She was sainted due to the fact she died rather than have an abortion in 1962. Her pregnancy, fortunately, resulted in a (still) living daughter. What I find curious about her story however is that there must be other Catholic women who have in some way sacrificed their life (or at least risked it) to continue a pregnancy. Indeed, plenty of pregnant people I know seem willing to put up with a lot of hardships to ensure the best for their future children. It seems expected by society.

Not long before Molla's time that may have been there the only choice. But Molla's the only one I know of who has been sainted. And I can't help but think that's because she had a living daughter. Most threats to a pregnant person mean death for a fetus. Stories like hers are rare. 
Yet we don't hear as much about the others. And the people who died for dead babies aren't held up as famous heroes. Alongside Molla, there should be several other saints. But there aren't.

It's frustrating to hear prolifers talk positively of people who persevere through difficult pregnancies when they actively minimize the harmful effects of pregnancy and are trying to deny them the choice of whether to go through that pregnancy to begin with. 

An honest pro-life movement should talk about pre-and post-natal depression, back problems, vaginal tearing, bleeding in excessive amounts, and even just not feeling happy about a pregnancy (whether just at the start or for the whole time). But the pro-life movement seems determined to create an alternative reality where pregnancy is always the best thing ever unless your ""selfish"".

But the feds have dissed me
They ignore and dismiss me
The pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic

If the Shoe Fits...,"...Then it's accurate, in this case, the ""anti-choice"" description.  I came across this ""gem"" from a prolifer recently, practically giving us this order:

 ***""Don't Call Us Anti-Choice, Ever""***  

*Don't call it anti-choice, more than 99% of people who get abortions chose to have sex.  You knew the risk and you made the choice.  So don't F\*\*\*\*\*g say you had no choice but to get an abortion.  Less than 1% of abortions are caused by rape.  We're not anti-choice, we're anti-murder because you got unlucky.  It doesn't f\*\*\*\*\*g matter how small the fetus is.  By killing it, you are preventing them from living a life.  If you have an unwanted pregnancy, that sucks, don't be someone who punishes others for their own misfortune. The baby doesn't deserve to die because you are upset with what happened. ""*

My response:  Not sorry, but in my book the **anti-choice** label fits anyone who wants to force women to stay pregnant and give birth against their will through the use of abortion-ban legislation.  And I'll use the term whenever **I** decide it applies.

*I switched to being pro-choice before I left my religion.* I felt a lot of empathy for women who would be forced to bear a child after sexual intercourse (while the man wouldn't), and there were so many cases where abortion made more sense (genetic diseases, rape, incest, medical complications, extreme poverty, overpopulation, abusive households, etc.) And then there were the kids being thrown in foster homes....the list of reasons to accept abortion just went on and on the more I learned about it, and the science of when consciousness begins and when fetuses can feel pain was the final nail in the coffin for me. The pro-life arguments just seemed way too idealistic and dogmatic.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on, recently I visited r/prolife for the first time. I don't think about abortion much unlike people on this sub, but I visited and **I made a topic asking them about aborting a child with Down Syndrome to see if I had missed a good pro-life argument.** Since eugenics and even abortion have a history of being misused by tyrants, I expected to hear some compelling arguments I hadn't thought of that might make me rethink my position (or at least historical examples I hadn't heard.) Or some complicated and detailed philosophical argument.

But nope, there were no specific historical examples, and it was just the familiar platitudes. There was a lot of name-calling and ""murdering babies is wrong."" *Only one guy linked to a study.*

What really shocked me were the incredible levels of ignorance about *basic philosophical concepts* on that side. No one seemed to look up any unfamiliar terms I used to understand the opposing argument before jumping on their ready-made and accusatory talking points.

I honestly had forgotten how dogmatic and yet passionate most of these people can be. I wasn't hearing nearly as much nuance as I expected, and just a lot of arguments as to why you should never abort a fetus because ""No one has the right to take the life of another."" They take considerable amounts of time to inform themselves about their own position, and yet they don't ever seem to ask the more fundamental questions about their beliefs, or to read more broadly into the history of things they ostensibly oppose like eugenics.

&amp;#x200B;

**The main take away:**

***I realized most pro-lifers still subscribe to objective morality.*** Most were obviously religious, (although religion isn't necessary for someone to be that dogmatic. Someone could also be pro-choice and claim that abortion is ""objectively moral"" while being just as dogmatic.)

I was surprised at how many people didn't seem to even understand subjective morality and who just tended to think arguments that aren't predicated on objective morality are just psychopathic. (Or made in bad faith.)

And it blew me away how many people seemed to think that imagined inalienable human rights and an individual's right to be born were more important principles than utilitarianism. Obviously, I know that people think that way...but it's stunning that after years of people debating abortion so many pro-lifers are still extremely idealistic to the point of not admitting just how pragmatic abortion really is in a multitude of circumstances.

It's more like there's a bot net of computers that are running the same program in a coordinated DDOS attack to limit your resources when you're trying to make a reasoned argument.

Question from a philosophy student," Hello, I recently got interested in how people develop their own opinions over time since so much of the world seems polarized these days. It's fascinating how small choices here and there push you to one side or the other, anyway I had a question and wanted to come to ask since this is the place for anything pro-life. I've been thinking a lot about philosophy and women's rights over the years since even in the modern day we seem to get pushed to the side, especially with abortion. I wanted to ask if a 16-year-old wanted to adopt a child, should they be allowed to adopt a child? What about a 15-year-old? Or a 14-year-old? If they are pregnant and not just going to adopt a child, how does this change your view on it? At least in the US, a lot of women die giving birth because the current system isn't great, so early on before anything develops and the child is a clump of cells, at what point does it go from being a lump of chemicals to a human? If both the mother and the child will die during birth, is it morally just to have an abortion and try to save someone? What about if the pregnancy was caused by rape?

I don't care about your ""accountability"" because children are not a punishment 

Children ARE, living, breathing, human beings with thoughts, feelings, hopes and dreams of their own.

And it is completely baffling to be that Pro-Lifers will say ""Children Are A Gift"" but also, ""If she didn't want kids, she shouldn't have had sex. Now she had to deal with the consequences.""

Like, are babies a BLESSING or a CURSE??? Pick ONE!

If a baby is going to be brought into this world, I want them to be in the home of someone who wanted them and loves them and is going to care for them to the BEST of their abilities 

Not some 17 year old who has no job and no school and now has to raise a kid

"Just learned something about my beautiful, precious late grandmother and now I’m crying... *more inside*","And I wish I could hug her, tell her how strongly pro-choice I’ve become.... I never really discussed issues such as this one with her before but now I wish I had after hearing what my grandpa put her through..... he’s Staunchly pro-life and even against birth control... but when he married her he pretended to be all for birth control. He took her life away. She was forced to get married to him at only 16 years old and then forced to give birth to a total of 4 children all before the age of 25.... My grandma’s first two pregnancies were wanted though. After my mom and uncle were born, she wanted to stop. She never wanted more than 2 children. My asshole grandpa secretly wanted 6 children. So he deceived her. My grandma made him promise her to be careful and wear a condom... she wanted to wear one too but he wouldn’t allow her... he made the excuse of “oh no, it’s more uncomfortable for a woman to wear one... I want you to feel comfy. I promise to be careful and wear one for us.” He lied... he pretended to put one on. Next thing my grandma knew she had a 3rd pregnancy that was unwanted... she cried and told my grandpa she thought he was being careful..,, he on the other hand was happy and acted like it was no big deal and wouldn’t allow her to abort. Again the same thing happened with a 4th pregnancy that was unwanted.... finally after that my grandpa decided to stop because of the anguish in her eyes. I think she died never knowing how much my grandpa deceived her and now I’m crying. I love my aunt (my grandma’s 3rd pregnancy) and my other uncle (my grandma’s 4th) but my God..... oh and my grandpa is also anti lgbt and my grandma’s 4th child that he forced her to have ended up being gay and my grandpa doesn’t approve of my grandma’s 3rd child’s lifestyle so guess God works in mysterious ways and punished him for forcing my grandma to pop out more children she didn’t want...... good!

Response to anti-abortion arguments on the basis of potentiality?,"I’ll give the example that spawned this post:

One of the more common Pro-Life arguments that I have heard is, if a conceived human fetus is left to its natural processes, it will develop into a baby independent of the womb. Generally this is rebutted by saying that the potentiality for value is not the same as having intrinsic value at a given moment, in the same way that a seed is not equivalent to a tree. 

The pro life person then brings up whether it is morally acceptable to kill a person in a coma, given that they at that moment do not have sentience. The pro choice person says no, and this is generally because the person in the coma was sentient before they entered the coma, and has the potential to be sentient again after the coma. The pro life person then says that they agree, and that the fetus also has potential, therefore raising a hypocrisy charge.

Are there any rebuttals to arguments on the basis of a fetus’ potentiality, especially those that do not neglect the rights of a non-sentient adult?",t2_4e6gpnxo,1621174306,prochoice

Pro-life = Pro-inaction,"Has anyone else noticed a similar theme that it is not actually about ""saving fetuses"" and more about promoting and trying to force women's inaction when it comes to pregnancy?

Good example of this is most dislike plan B, for some insane reason they think it is stopping implantation which it does not but even if it did, pregnancy does not start till implantation in any case. It is not an abortion.

Yet they are against the woman taking even the smallest action if it could result in the zef dying.
Ie inaction bias/omission bias.

Many have no issue with women taking no action even if it causes death of the zef ie refusing a shot to stop the woman's immune system from attacking the fetus or not getting a cercage by choice.

Has anyone else noticed this and want to add to more innaction bias you have noticed from pro-lifers?
Have any of you noticed them ever favor action in terms of pregnancy to save the fetus?

I asked a Q in AD but none really answered in good faith. I wanted to know if they think a woman should be allowed to refuse an emergency C section if it meant the fetus would die. Since often emergency C sections are due to fetal distress. The woman does have s right to refuse one.
So either they have such a strong inaction bias they are just pro-inaction and would let fetus die or they would force a literal serious surgery on the woman.",t2_5vlvig8t,1621164893,prochoice

**What if they are like 14 and they want to keep the child? Do you think of 14 year old should raise a child?**

'Pregnancy can't be that bad because women used to have lots of kids',"This is such a bullshit argument I've seen over and over again from PL that is heavily tied into their conservatism and wanting to go back to the 'good old days' (you know, when women were basically slaves to men and had no role outside housewife and mother).

Let's just take the US as an example. Given that until the 1960s and beyond, a) birth control didn't exist b) marital rape wasn't a crime and c) abortion was illegal, women essentially had zero choice in whether they had children or not. Even if some women DID want 10 children, it still wasn't a choice because there was nothing they could have done to not have children.

I've seen PL express the view, in various ways, that women nowadays are just 'weak' because women used to birth lots of children in the past. That's right ladies, they think we're just avoiding our 'natural role' that women throughout history have happily succumbed to.

It is just unbelievably naive to think that all women used to have 10 kids because they wanted to. Heck, this was before modern medicine, so childbirth was far more dangerous than it is now. You can bet anything you like that if birth control and abortion were available back then, women would have behaved exactly as they do today.",t2_7vjuchsg,1621077459,prochoice

It’s always about control,"I recently got my birth control taken out after it expired and didn’t replace it with something else, so back to condoms for now. My (now ex) bf who claimed to be pro-life, tried to get me to have unprotected sex with him, TWICE, after I made it clear we needed to use condoms and have told him multiple times that I am absolutely not interested in having kids anytime soon. Like I’m talking he tried pushing himself inside me before I could say anything. I told him to stop and that he needs to put on a condom.  Although he did what I asked, 10 minutes later he asked if he could have a few pumps raw. I said absolutely not. The whole time he was whining about how it didn’t feEl aS gOoD with a condom.

Previously, we had an argument when I told him that I’d abort a pregnancy if it happened, and he told me how wrong and evil it is to kill a bAbY and how he’d lose some respect for me if I chose to do that. I went off on him over that and said okay well theres no point in a relationship together if you don’t even respect your own girlfriend as a person with dreams and aspirations over a non-sentient clump of cells, he did eventually apologize and said he wouldn’t like it but he would respect my choice. He also said he wasn’t sure if he could handle being in the room while I was having hypothetical abortion. I knew I should have ended it muchhhhhh sooner than I did. 

When I went to break up with him today, part of the reason being that he was pushing my very clear boundaries around sex (among many other reasons), he suddenly claimed to not know that that could lead to a baby even if he didn’t ejaculate inside me. He made excuses about how he thought it would be okay and all the ways he justified it in his own head and even claimed that he thought I’d enjoy it. Right.

I told him he was selfish for putting my body and health on the line, AGAINST MY WILL, all for his pleasure. Funny when it’s about getting his own dick wet, who cares about any potentially aborted babies? Who cares about his girlfriend who has to deal with a possible pregnancy physically and emotionally without his support because he’s too much of a baby to deal with his own irresponsible actions?

I’m convinced the medication didn’t do anything for me. They had me take it 10 minutes beforehand, and I felt everything. It was so painful I almost yelled. When it was over, one of them asked if it was as bad as I thought it would be. I said it was actually worse than I thought. I asked if the meds would kick in soon and was told they already should’ve.

"I think we've all heard ""If men could get pregnant..."" how attitudes towards abortion would be completely different. But imagine if pregnancy had no ties to sex.","Imagine if pregnancy was something that just naturally happened every so often to women, like menstruation.

 Regardless of whether you've even had sex, [female humans just spontaneously produced a viable foetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis) about once every few years on average.

There was no way to predict when or even intentionally cause it.

Pregnancy would be prevented with birth control, and abortions would be so commonplace and de-stigmatised that medication to induce termination of pregnancy would be as easily accessible as tampons. Women would nonchalantly say ""Ergh, pregnant again"" with an eye roll. ""That's so unfair,"" her friend would say. ""You only terminated one a month ago!""

Even though nothing about foetuses or gestation has changed in any sense– except for the constant possibility of parthenogenesis–  the ""pro-life"" movement would have zero chance of gaining any popularity in such a world.

Pro-life arguments tend to have the same implication hidden behind them; you had sex, so you are morally obligated to carry the pregnancy to term. The simple fact that reproduction has been de-coupled from sex means that this could not be a thing. 

They could no longer ""blame"" a foetus' existence on anyone or anything.

Their assertion that foetus' are people would be instantly dismissed as irrelevant, even meaningless. It's still a foreign presence *inside* of another person who has a life already. The assertion that abortion is murder would be self-evidently nonsense.

Comment from r/politicalcompassmemes,"I kind of almost believe it unironically.

Like I understand abortion if its early on (4-5 months or less), and in the case of significant birth defects. However, why not just birth the baby, and give it away? I understand the argument that if you cant afford the time and money to raise a child, that child will likely end up in a life of crime of something.

What I don't understand about the abortion crowd, is why the option of, giving the baby to someone who wants it, is not even a possible option to them. The only option if you don't want a baby, is killing it. Seems kind of psychopathic. I mean, strictly from an efficiency standpoint, its a complete waste of resources to grow a baby, and then kill it. How much extra food did the mother eat during that time, those wasted resources are a contribution to climate change.

You can donate (tax wrote off), or sell the baby you a family who wants it, or you can put them in an orphanage which teaches the children how to perform manual labor. We are murdering all these children we could be putting to work. Would could end private prisons. Have the abortion orphans make license plates. We don't need to work them to death or anything, but 4 hours a day of work seems like a good idea. Have 4 hours of schooling, 4 hours of labor. Seems reasonable to me. Having them enter a life of work, seems way more humane than killing them outright.

How Anti-Abortion Activists Are Harmful To Society.


    Abortion is an extremely controversial and complicated issue. Being pro-life is harmful to women everywhere, due to the fact that it forces views on women who can’t afford to take care of a kid, it puts more children in the foster care system, and it causes unsafe abortions. There are many different reasons why one would get an abortion, one being that they are living in poverty. Another being that they don’t want to raise a child in a bad environment. Some women get abortions just because they don’t want kids. Every one of these reasons is valid, and we shouldn’t shame women for making choices that are best for them and their future.

    If abortion was made illegal, that would leave many women with the choice to put their kid in the foster care system. Statistics show that there are approximately 400,000 children in the foster care system right now. With the thousands of kids with no permanent homes, “In 2019, more than 17,000 young people aged out of foster care without permanent families. Research has shown that those who leave care without being linked to forever families have a higher likelihood than youth in the general population to experience homelessness, unemployment, and incarceration as adults.” On top of that, many foster care homes are abusive towards their foster kids, but the children have no place else to go. “But in surveys going back for decades, from 25 percent to as high as 40 percent of former foster children report having been abused or neglected in care.” Claims Marcia Lowry. With this many children in the system, and so many children being abused, nobody should want to put a child through that for 18 years.

    

Another way that anti-abortion is harmful to society is because banning abortions doesn’t stop them from happening. If abortions were banned, women would simply find more unsafe ways to do it. At home abortions very often the cause of the death in some women, they can be dangerous and extremely deadly. In 1966, Romania banned abortions, “As a last resort, many Romanian women turned to home and back-alley abortions, and by 1989, an estimated 10,000 women had died as a result of unsafe procedures.” Without access to proper birth control and healthcare, such as companies like Planned Parenthood, abortion would become more common if anything. With no birth control, there would be higher pregnancy rates, which means a higher demand for safe abortions. “And abortion rates are actually four times higher in low-income countries where abortion is prohibited than in high-income countries where it is broadly legal.” Coming from NBC News.

Another issue with anti-abortion activists is that they dont take into consideration rape or incest cases. If a woman was raped and grew pregnant with her rapists child, it’s safe to assume that she wouldn’t exactly want to carry that child for 9 months and then proceed to raise it for 18 years. “Georgia passed a bill banning abortions after six weeks and includes the exceptions, but requires an official police report alleging the crimes (research shows 3 out of every 4 sexual assaults are not reported, and out of every 1,000 rapes only five perpetrators are convicted).” says USA Today. With statistics showing that in the United States, 1 in 5 women are raped, that’s 18% percent of women who are in the US. Women make up about 50.8% percent of the US population. To put it into perspective, the population of the United States is 328.2 Million people, if about half of them are women, 164,100,000 women are in the US, With 18% of those women being raped, there is a total of around 29,538,000 women who are raped. 1% of those women grow pregnant with their rapists child, which makes 295,380 women. That’s still a lot, making abortion necessary for those numbers. Keep in mind, these are only the rapes that get reported. So the argument about how only 1% of women grow pregnant with their rapists kids, is accurate, however many people dont actually realize how big those numbers are.

While many anti-abortion activists could use an argument something along the lines of “The fetus can feel pain.” However, studies have shown that many fetuses cannot feel pain until they reach at least 20 weeks. According to the CDC, in 2017 92.2% of abortions were performed before 13 weeks. 6.9% were performed from 14-20 weeks, and 1% or less were performed after 20 weeks, and those were medical situations. It can be harmful to women by making them think that they are being inhumane, when in reality, they’re obtaining the abortion to do whats best for them.

While this is still a heavly debated topic in society today, anti-abortion activists still harm many women while attempting to get their point across. It’s good to think that people know what’s best for their own bodies, because by taking away the right to choose, many children will end up hurt, as will women. The child could potentially end up in an abusive foster care home, and thinking that their biological parents didn’t want them, when that simply isn’t the case. Many fetuses will end up brutally hurt because the carrier of them couldn’t gain access to a safe, medical abortion. By raising a child in a poor environment, whether that means poverty, abusive homes, or likely to end up in trouble with the law, it’s something nobody wants to put a child through, which is why it should be up to the carrier of the fetus what they do with it or not.

Prolifers are gullible,"Reading a post where a prolifer cries about being banned from a med student sub. They lie to r/prolife and tell them that it is because someone had an elective abortion due to an IUD and the banned person shammed them. If you look at the post, the med student had her fallopian tube removed as it was an ectopic pregnancy and it was rupturing during surgery. 


Small quote from the med student who needed surgery:


&gt; I felt fine right up until I agreed to the surgery and ultimately when I started to feel lightheaded that is what ultimately convinced me that I needed to have the surgery. (Never had back pain) I was being operated on within 30 minutes. My fallopian tube was in the process of rupturing while they where preforming surgery.


Here is the banned student’s original comment:


https://imgur.com/gallery/2pqXSMg


And their post in the sub that prolifers go:


&gt; I responded to a post from someone who had an elective abortion because their IUD failed, and they were attempting to indict the medical system for failing to take care of them when they had side effects from mifepristone, the abortion pill. I said I was sorry for their situation and sorry for the life of the baby that was lost that would never be able to live a life like ours. When I was told it was just a clump of cells, I responded that we are all just a clump of cells; one of us is just much younger than the other. Apparently, this will get you banned.

&gt;I was somewhat expecting this to happen, given that I am also a medical student and the indoctrination is very real. We are explicitly conditioned to think any opposition to any form of abortion is unethical, bad and oppression. However, you also expect medical professionals to have the mental and emotional capacity to consider that maybe our practices are harming patients (including the ones who exist but we can’t see), not helping them. Instead of facing this reality and responding with an argument, permanent removal for this disagreement is apparently the appropriate response.

&gt;I once participated in a live abortion debate with other medical students, and they had never even heard our arguments against abortion before. It is disappointing that this happened, but it is also encouraging to think that the only way they have to defeat our positions is to silence us. If your response to “there could be someone sitting in the chair next to you today who lives life like you do and has touched the lives of countless people if abortion was not allowed” is to shut down the conversation, I find it difficult to believe the pro-choice side is supposed to be the one that cares more about people than the pro-life side.

&gt;Although this behavior is infuriating at times, this quote helps me remember to stay calm and keep going: “Most of the evil in this world does not come from evil people. It comes from people who consider themselves good.” People who support abortion consider themselves good, despite the evil practice they advocate for. We need to keep showing them the mirror and hope one day they will come to terms with the reality of their actions.

&gt;Anyway, all this is to say: keep fighting. Show compassion and make it the center of everything you say and do. Our friends on the other side need to ban us and silence us in order to justify their positions and behavior. They never hear the other side because they are insulated from it. However, the truth is powerful, and never let yourself be bullied into lying to yourself or to others.",t2_bzzcam2b,1620642274,prochoice
Conflating pregnancy care with infant care,"(I posted this in the debate sub last week. Thought it was worth sharing here as well.)

This argument conflates pregnancy as ordinary care that one provides to their ZEF much in the same manner that giving a bottle or changing a diaper is care one provides to their infant.

The problem with this argument is that it conflates a *symbiotic* (specifically a parasitic-symbiotic) relationship with that of *interdependency.*

I am going to define the differences between these three things:

* Symbiotic (parasitic-symbiotic) relationships
* Interdependency relationships
* Parts of a body and their relationship to that of a whole body

Humans are an interdependent species. We rely upon one another to have our needs met.

This does not involve a symbiotic-parasitic relationship nor are they the same.

Parasitism is defined [here](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-symbiosis.html) as:

* **parasitism** \- one species lives on, in or with a host species

It goes on further to say "" In [parasitism](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-parasitism.html), one organism benefits from the relationship at the expense of the other. The parasitic organism may live inside another organism's body (endoparasitism) or on its surface (ectoparasitism). The host species often weakens and sometimes dies, but in most cases, the parasite needs it to stay alive so it can keep feeding on it. ""

Now, this obviously isn't what a ZEF is as they are of the same species as us. But here we can see that this is not the same thing as an interdependent relationship.

Interdependent is [defined](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/interdependent) as:

* mutually [dependent](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dependent); depending on each other.

Now, infants and toddlers do have more dependency upon the older members of their group. That is not to say though that their parents do not have some sort of need being met by their young. They depend on them to provide the satisfaction of loving and caring for another human. They bring them happiness and joy. And while their young are far more dependent on them, *they are not living within their parent, weakening them* (ie causing things like morning sickness or requiring harmful, painful, exhausting labor and delivery with 6 weeks recovery time) *at the expense of their parent.*

Birth defines a crucial biological change. Once the ZEF is born, it is no longer biologically bound to a single organism host and it becomes interdependent upon other members of its species, not solely their host, further defining relationship differences and boundaries.

So, to recap:

* Living within (parasitism) vs living among (interdependency)
* Care is provided exclusively from the host (parasitism) vs care can be provided from the collective group (interdependency)
* Benefits are provided to the ZEF in a manner that weakens their mother (parasitism) vs benefits are not provided to an infant in a manner that weakens the mother (interdependency)

The ZEF needs to not be living *within* its host, *benefitting exclusively* off its host in a manner that weakens them, with no ability for contribution to be provided by the collective, before we can consider pregnancy to be the same type of care provided to young as that of interdependent relationships.

These are the differences between the two types of ""care"" provided to a zef vs an infant. To classify them as the same requires ignoring key differences and loosely defining the relationships.

To further support the case of highlighting key differences between a symbiotic relationship and an interdependent one, we need to not just define the *similarities* between a parasite and a ZEF, but also their *differences*. Because as I explained before, they are not, in fact, parasites as they are of the same species.

ZEFs are not just topologically contained *within* their mother. They are hooked *into* them, intertwined with them so as to act more as a part of a whole.

Parts of a whole body are intertwined on a:

* Homeostatic level
* Metabolic level
* Functional level
* Topological (continuity) level
* Immunological level

It is this type of relationship between parts of a body that define the whole. When these elements are lost, they are no longer considered to be a part of a whole organism's body.

I wrote about this previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/j0mld2/parthood_view_of_pregnancy_makes_more_sense_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Because of this, not only is the relationship of a ZEF further separated from interdependency through the understanding of parasitism, it is further separated from it by understanding that the relationship of a ZEF is more part-like with that of its mother's body. Meaning that for all intents and purposes, the mother's body recognizes a ZEF more as of its body than recognizing it as that of a parasite. It is literally a *part* of her body, *not merely just contained within it in a parasitic manner.* Individual members of a species that function merely interdependently **do not** share those attributes.

ZEFs are not the same as that of a born infant and thus should not be treated as such. We cannot ignore the differences between a ZEF and an infant whilst advocating for the benefits of their similarities.",t2_6gi7y,1620630466,prochoice

A different approach to pro-choice activism: Lifetime ethics advocacy,"An account on Twitter posted the following thread and I thought it was worth sharing.

***

The abortion access movement needs to focus on things like bodily autonomy and damage from pregnancy, more than anything else. But I don’t see those issues taking hold, especially with groups meant to represent us. Even saying pregnancy hurts women is still taboo. 

So I’m thinking we should begin a “school of thought” that spotlights women’s physical and emotional well-being related to reproduction, rather than taking traditional approaches such as fetal development, financial security, or abortions that are necessary to prevent children from suffering debilitating illness. Those topics matter, but women’s bodies are at stake, so women’s bodies should be central to the discussion.

This would need a name and a symbol so that it can be recognized and proponents can communicate. I’ve come up with Lifetime Ethics Advocacy, and a purple circle for a symbol. 🟣 A circle representing the cycle of female disposability, and purple because it’s pretty. 

Some other subjects that would be relevant to a woman-centered pro-choice movement:

-human rights 

-human needs such as freedom and dignity 

-difference between work vs one’s body parts being used

-the precedent for not forcibly using bodies, such as criminalization of rape, forced experimentation, and the Constitutional amendment against slavery 

-emotional effects throughout and after such use

-fear inflicted by the knowledge that contraception could fail and they could be forced through traumatic violation

-effects on romantic relationships

-that girls considered “precious lives” before birth are no longer so upon fertility 

-the experiences of the four percent from the Turnaway Study who wished they could have aborted

-treating ZEFs as persons would require such things as investigating miscarriages 

-birth trauma 

Feel free to add your own ideas. Women’s freedom is a team effort!

***

I think this is a great idea. There’s a community of people on social media who emphasize these ideas as central to the need for abortion access, but they aren’t getting much attention outside that circle. A formal, organized movement would shift them to the forefront of the conversation.

Texas SB8: you should be angry about this.,"https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2384482

There's the text of the bill.

This bill will ban abortion after 6 weeks, when cardiac activity can be seen on ultrasound.  But instead of just saying that it's illegal, they say that anybody (literally *anybody*) can sue the physician.

But not just the physician.  They can sue anybody who is involved in helping the abortion happen.  Funding groups.  Groups that help with travel and childcare and other logistics.  The nurses at the clinic.  The volunteer clinic escorts.  The clinic *janitor*.

---

The bill is also poorly-written in two ways:

First, it allows abortions to be performed if an ultrasound was performed before six weeks, even if the abortion is done much later than that.  Not that this is likely to come up, but it's telling that the law is so poorly written.

Second, it specifically bans use of this law to sue people (""women"") who have had abortions in violation of this law.

&gt; This subchapter may not be construed to ... authorize the initiation of a cause of action against or the prosecution of a woman on whom an abortion is performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced in violation of this subchapter;

For which a plain-text reading would suggest that a physician who is a woman who had such an abortion could then not be prosecuted for performing such abortions.

Being pro-choice isn't necessarily just pro-abortion,"One thing I've come across a lot in this argument is people saying ""how can you be pro-choice but against abortion (for convenience)?"" And to that I say ""Well, I don't agree with getting an abortion just because you don't fancy the hard work that comes with being a parent. HOWEVER, I would NEVER try to take that choice away from you. My views mean that I MYSELF ONLY would not get an abortion without a valid reason. BUT, I believe that other people should also be allowed that choice. I don't believe in forcing people to give birth. I have the right to make decisions about my body, not someone else's. This makes me pro-choice, but against abortion without a valid reason for MYSELF ONLY.

Being pro-choice isn't about whether or not you support abortion. It's about whether or not you support someone's ability to CHOOSE to get an abortion.

Lets discuss “my body my choice”,"When pro-choice people use the phrase “My Body My Choice”, does it have limits? 

Many people are familiar with this phrase regarding to the growth of the fetus and the effect it has on the woman and therefore, it is her choice whether or not to choose an abortion. But how far does the “my body my choice” idea go? If the woman decides to keep the fetus and give birth, however, she is also doing drugs or participating in behavior that could cause harm to the fetus and ultimately lead to abnormalities after birth. Do you still support that it is her body her choice?

I should have been aborted..,"My mother came off of the streets. She was addicted to various drugs and had a heavy background of mental health issues. Eventually, she wound up pregnant. She did not want me. When I was born, my mother threatened to kill me, saying that I didn’t have a right to live and that I was an invasion to her body. 

I was then taken in by my grandparents, which was great, until I was around 10 or 11 when my grandmother died and my grandfather fell into a heavy depression and started neglecting me. He died by the time I was 15 and I was taken into care by my aunt, who took all of the inheritance from my grandparents home, sold my dog, and used me for labor until I wasn’t of use to her anymore and she tried to put me into foster care. No foster homes would take me in as I was turning 16, so she gave me away to a woman who physically and verbally abused me until I moved out at 16 with no job and was forced to live on my own with no family left to support me. 

I wish I was aborted. If I was aborted, I wouldn’t have gone through years of loss, neglect, abandonment, abuse, and other trauma. But here I am, 17 and living alone, faced with the reality that I am unwanted in this world. 
 
Would you rather have a child go through years of trauma and attempt to commit suicide, or kill it when it’s a fetus so it doesn’t have to go through that pain?

"Can we stop with the whole ""never get an abortion"" thing?","You don't have to ""want"" and abortion. You don't have to ever plan on getting one. But ***please*** can we stop with the whole ""most prochoicer would never get an abortion"" and the :""i'd personally never be able to get an abortion"" because it places a lot of stigma on abortion itself and the people who've had them. 

When you feel the need to point out how most prochoicers or yourself wouldn't get an abortion, you're saying abortion is bad, it's something only ***those*** people do. Some only others do. Antichoicers see ya'll saying that and instantly it feeds into their Us vs. Them mentality, and if you'd ""never get an abortion"" they, in their minds, think they can easily sway you.  

&amp;#x200B;

It also feeds into the idea that abortion isn't a medical procedure that's necessary, sure we know that they are. But when antichoicers just read about people who actually made the choice to get an abortion, never the people who would have, or did die without an abortion for their very much wanted pregnancy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going out of your way to make sure others know ""Hey, I'd never do **that**!"" makes others think that thing, is bad. People who say they don't smoke, often end up saying it in a not too pleasant way, it comes off the same way, especially online. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not saying people who say that mean it in that way, but i know that's how prolifers especially read it. There is really not need to tell people if you would or wouldn't have an abortion ***given the choice***, there is no reason whatsoever to tell people you'd ""never"" get one, it just feeds into their ""see its not really necessary!"" bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Abortion is a word that talks about a wide array of procedures, and reasons for those procedures. I know we often talk about ""choice"" but sometimes that ""choice"" is taken from you, and you still need an abortion you do not want. They don't care. They see that abortion no different than one done by choice, no matter what they claim.  We need to stick together and not squash out the Us vs. Them mentality that often comes out when people start feeling the need to say they'd ""never get an abortion"". The more people who run around saying that, the more antichoicers think abortions really aren't needed since so many ""Would never get one"", and that's not cool.",t2_asxiwl7p,1620137752,prochoice

if a woman gets pregnant, she gets to make the choice to keep it or not. If she doesn't want to keep it, she shouldn't have to. it's her uterus, and she owes it to no one. 


she is a conscious human being, with feelings, and decisions to make. the fetus is not, it's not gonna know shit about fuck.

I am so sick of the way the effects of pregnancy are consistently ignored and undermined by PL,"It just makes me so incredibly angry the way they call pregnancy an 'inconvenience' or 'a discomfort'. There are so, so many injuries and health complications that can occur as a result of pregnancy, things that can affect your body for the rest of your fucking \*life\*. Even the most seemingly healthy and easy of pregnancies can quickly turn south in the delivery room. There are so many birth horror stories on the internet. 

And women are just expected to put up with this shit. The fact that people roll their eyes when you suggest pregnancy should require a woman's ongoing consent tells you everything you need to know about their view of women. Pregnant women who \*want\* to be pregnant and have a baby complain about the sickness and the pain, and people think it's acceptable to make a woman go through with it \*against her will\*?

It is absolutely, undoubtedly a result of people having it drilled into their heads that pregnancy is just what women are supposed to do. That's not even a fucking reach, it's the truth, and people won't admit it. It is just ridiculous that we give people so much sympathy for having illnesses and injuries that are not nearly as bad as pregnancy, yet when a woman complains about pregnancy people just go 'oh, but the precious baby! Childbirth is a miracle!' 

The fact that many people don't even think rape victims should be allowed to abort just proves that they're living in some fantasy land. Anyone who thinks it is \*remotely acceptable\* to make a woman endure pregnancy and childbirth that she had absolutely zero control over in the first place needs locking up in a mental institution. Like, I get the argument that if a woman chose to have sex, the she 'consented' to the pregnancy. It makes no logical sense and still doesn't justify removing women's human rights, but I get it. But you must be seriously far gone to genuinely believe that it would be murder for a woman to pop a pill and shed her uterine lining to remove an embryo that was created inside her entirely as a result of a man's non-consensual actions. 

Anyone who doesn't take 'I do want to be pregnant' as a good enough reason to have an abortion has been completely and utterly brainwashed into hating women.",t2_8lje7nkm,1620057100,prochoice

I told my parents I’m pro choice and I’m terrified,"
This is going to be an extremely personal post. 

TW: Sexual Assault

For context: I’ve had these terrifying dreams that I had been raped. It’s not a dream of it happening, but it’s of the aftermath. They’re repetitive. The more dreams I have, the more I learn about the sexual assault case. In the first one, I didn’t know what happened. It was just a normal dream. In the last one, I had learned that I had been raped in some sort of office, in a room in all velvet, by some old CEO. I was begging my conservative parents for an abortion, but I couldn’t get one. 

That dream was the one that made me rethink my prolife stance. I couldn’t confidently say I was prolife. I couldn’t confidently say I didn’t believe in abortion anymore. Now, I’m pro choice, simply because I don’t know every situation of every person who gets an abortion.

Here I am, tonight. I was in a political debate with my dad. My mom’s end-all be-all argument is “I really hope you don’t stand for abortion.” I couldn’t avoid the question, so I told her about the dream. 

I had told her about it in the past, where she had been comforting, kind, and understanding why I wanted the abortion in the dream. She said “It wasn’t fair,” so she understood, saying that it’s normal to have dreams where you wake up pregnant.

This time, she told me I sounded like a snowflake. She said she thought I was truly ill (i.e. mentally ill.) 

I don’t know what to do. My parents are disgusted with me. They think I’m a baby murderer. I don’t know what to do. 

How do I get through this? How can we agree to disagree?

I know it’s a big issue. I know some people will think I’m a baby murderer. I just don’t know what to do.

How I de-indoctrinated myself from a childhood and early adulthood worth of far right (forced birther especially) brainwashing,"So... It's kinda hard to figure out how to start... I (21, closeted MtF) was raised by Orthodox Christian parents, and especially rabid ones at that. You know, the whole anti-vaxx, anti video game, Dr. Blaylock and Breitbard/Infowars/etc... worshiping, religious, Trump loving, childhood controlling, ultra LGBTQ-phobic, anti-whatever, emotionally/academically/physically abusive ""tiger parent"" deal... My childhood sucked for the most part. For years they just spilled conspiracy theories and religious beliefs (aka religious and right wing self-loathing and self guilt tripping) and so on on me... I'm gonna spare you all the full story cause writing any more of that in detail is just a massive triggerfest and I really don't wanna ruin myself before an exam that I have tomorrow...

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd been sorta secretly keeping my pro-choice feelings hidden from even myself, but never let that actually come out and continued to convince myself that I was a forced birther, bla bla bla... Well the universe has it's funny ways of teaching lessons and saving people from far-right cults. I left Christianity for my own devious witchy/occult path in January. That was the first step. I just wanted some freedom and so on. But then whatever made me do that slammed me even harder by putting me into the position of being a victim of far-right discriminatory bullcrap. My personal years-suppressed issues with gender dysphoria had overblown to the point I finally accepted that I am a transgender woman. The discrimination and utter hate I received when I came out to my mom as a trans lesbian made me think: ""Wait a second, there's nothing wrong or invalid with me being a transgender woman, yet the conservatives hate me. What else could they have freaking lied to me about?"". Then it just blew up and after reading a few pro-choice articles and plenty of thinking I realized that the whole pro-life thing was yet another load of horrendous hateful and abusive dogcrap, along with pretty much \*everything\* political I had previously thought was true. I had to re-educate myself from ground zero (yeah, no ""leftist re-education camps"", as the forced birthers call them, were required, but rather it just took common sense and a few ContraPoints educational videos).

Needless to say, I feel so liberated and far more true to myself now that I am not a brainwashed bot anymore. It's scary looking back at my childhood (honestly one huge mess of lies and self-loathing), as I am generally a very hard person to brainwash in most regards.

I said that even if you consent to a risky activity, you are allowed to receive medical treatment for anything that happens to you, because consent to the risk of something is not the same as consenting to the thing itself. 

He then said that actually, he thinks if someone chooses to engage in a risky activity, they should not be allowed to receive medical care because what happened to them was 'their fault'.

this is a sad case and she definitely could have been evitated, she could have gotten help but she didn't, which we can't blame her, she was malnourished, she was depressed, she gave birth to her daughter in her bathroom and she was only 18, in Ohio abortion is illegal (and since she was anorexic, she didn't notice she was pregnant till she was almost 8 months on it), she was given control pills by her doctor and her parents were very abusive (her mother told her that if everything was the truth, she would ruin her life, she told her that everything was like that because of her fault + she was why she started with her eating disorder) and basically--- she wasn't ready, and still, she got a felony charge and years of probation because she ""killed a child and tried to burn it (this was disproven in the trial, the baby was born dead and she didn't try to burn it like one of the detectives tried to make it seem) and then buried it"".

and yet still prolifers are blaming her, telling her that she is murder and deserves prison, I understand that what she did was wrong but she doesn't deserve the hate she gets from the people, she was scared, she was a victim.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m pro-life BECAUSE I’m liberal

One of the major values on the liberal side is social justice and equality. I strongly believe that people of all races, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, ages, and sizes should be given the same basic human rights. It’s for this reason that I am pro-life.

I find it ironic that liberals often claim to support full equality and yet, on the other hand, they also support one of the worst forms of discrimination in the form of abortion.

**How is abortion discrimination?** Because it says that a living human being is not worthy of life unless it possesses certain cognitive capabilities or unless it reaches a certain size or unless it is outside of the womb. **This is ableism. This is sizeism. This is discrimination based on geographic location.** This is no better than racism or xenophobia or any other form of bigotry.

So next time you find yourself in an argument with a pro-choice liberal, try pointing out that abortion is just another form of discrimination.",t2_70dbs8bs,1619712559,prochoice
"“But is it though...””Abortion or no abortion, either way the baby is not in a good option....”","If a woman gets pregnant and later on has an abortion pro life people say she is killing a human being and that it’s wrong. 

But what if the woman gets pregnant and then later on gives it up for adoption. 

Pro lifers say that is the right thing to do.

But is it though? There are millions of kids🧒 👦 👧 already in the foster care system. Many of them end up homeless, uneducated, pregnant themselves, in and out of foster homes until they age out of the system, a ward of the state, sexually or physically abused by either adoptive or foster parents. Foster care is terrible. The system is over-run, over worked, and underpaid. I would know, because I have a friend (Joseph) who is a social worker, and places kids with foster families. He often complains about how demeaning and horrible his job is. Everyday countless people dump their unwanted kids and it’s almost impossible to place them all. And many older kids often have breakdowns and mental issues from being in the system for so long. It’s really sad. 

A man I was reading about was in and out of foster care his whole life, sexually abused and physically abused. Long story short he tried to kill his foster system. All that rage and aggression from being in the system for so long he tried to take it out on the first female he could. 
Unfortunately he ended up snapping and committing rape and murder and he killed an innocent young woman in Parkland City, Kansas. He is now serving life in prison with no possibility of parole, and that beautiful young lady is gone and her family is in complete mourning.

If that man had been aborted, that beautiful young woman wouldn’t have had to die the way she did. 

Pro lifers: “but she should just keep the baby 🍼 it’s the right thing to do.”

But is it though?? That child is going to grow up unloved and unwanted. Making a child grow up with someone who would never ever love and support them....you are a causing more harm on that child’s psyche than ever. My mother took care of an elderly woman (Susan) who had three kids (back in her day her parents pretty much pushed her into marrying young. And her husband “made her” have kids; she wanted to be independent and not have kids ever) 
She told her sons and daughter what an inconvenience they were, they were a mistake, their father made her have them. She never loved or cared for her kids and she made sure they knew that she was only there to fulfill her motherly duties but nothing more. 
One of her kids tried committing suicide, the other kid ran away as soon as they turned 18, and the other kid checks in on her time to time but he doesn’t love his mother and actually can’t wait till she dies so he can get his hands on the insurance money. His words....

Pro lifers: Punishing a baby because the woman was raped is wrong. She should just keep it, it’s the right thing to do.

Is it though? That child will always be a constant reminder of what happened to her. That child will want to know where they came from, who their father is, etc. 
Even if a woman goes through with the pregnancy and does give it up for adoption there is no guarantee that child won’t find her and want “answers”.
She will have to relive every single sickening detail of what happened to her. And tell that kid “everything” And depending on genetics 🧬 she’ll have to see her rapist’s face and tell (them) what happened. And if a woman decides to keep the child and “raise them” the man that raped her has full rights to the child and can even take her to court for visitations and/or joint custody. Can you imagine having to deal with your rapist like that. Can you imagine what that kind of trauma that does to a woman? Let alone a child? Many children who were conceived via rape or incest (after finding out that that is how they came into existence) end up raping someone themselves or committing suicide because the psyche of knowing that that is how they were conceived is just too much too handle. 

My point that I’m trying to make is either way, the child is not in a good option. Abortion or not. 

Abortion is a personal choice and it should be left up to the parents. You don’t have to like it or support it but one should think 🤔 about the circumstances and take it as a case by case basis and not insert their own opinions into it. Just because one would go that certain way doesn’t mean everyone is going to follow that way. 

Personally, (and this is what I personally think) they are better off not being on the earth 🌏 than they are being in the foster care system or being with someone who doesn’t want them or love them to begin with. Or being told the truth about the unfortunate circumstances of how they came to be...",t2_abgpmnhs,1619711964,prochoice

One reason pro life arguments bother me so much is the complete disregard for consent I see and how that affects me (and I assume others),"I have experienced situations twice in my life where my consent was disregarded. I can honestly say it is the most horrible and terrifying feeling I have encountered in my life. The knowledge that a person or persons don't consider your decisions, choices, wants or needs in any way. That you can refuse and they will ignore you. A complete feeling of powerlessness and despair. And in my case neither was anywhere close to the length of time a pregnant person would have their consent violated if forced to remain pregnant.

Any time I see a pro-life person absolutely disregard the pregnant person's consent that just says to me that they don't know what a truly horrifying thing that is or they just don't care. And I'm not sure I know which is worse. It gets to me more than anything else they say, probably because of my own experiences.

And sometimes I think about if they got their way and abortion was banned, the message that would send to me and anyone who feels similarly would be ""it's legally ok for your consent to violated"" and just how devastating that would be.

"When pro-lifers claim we don’t want women to have options, but rather that we want to force them to have an abortion...","I remember reading a comment yesterday from a pro-lifer claiming that pro-choicers don’t even provide women with options other than to have an abortion. As in, we force women who are unsure if they want to carry until term or terminate the pregnancy, to just have an abortion. 

If my friend is pregnant and is very very nervous, and completely unsure if they would like to terminate the pregnancy or not, I would 100% recommend them to have an abortion. Pregnancy and childbirth are not walks in the park, or things you can just “try out” as if they’re hobbies. That’s 9 months of gestation that WILL take a toll on the human body, not to mention how damaging it can be to one‘s emotional health if they’re being forced to gestate. I would ask them to think about if they’re ready to have a child, to study pregnancy and see if they’re okay with going through it, to speak with their doctor about how it will affect their health overall. I would advise them that if they’re very unsure at all, and do not feel comfortable in the slightest to carry until term, they should have an abortion. 

Pregnancy is only a beautiful and amazing process to someone who is happy with being pregnant. It’s only a beautiful and fascinating experience if one intentionally got pregnant, or is overall happy with carrying until term. The decision is entirely up to them. 

In reality, what some pro-lifers want us to do is convince or coerce women to carry until term. They don’t like that we offer abortion as an option, so when they say we offer abortion as the only option, what they mean is they want us to coerce women into having children. After all, there are only two options: carry until term and give birth, or terminate the pregnancy. Pro-choicers say women should ultimately speak with a medical professional and decide for themselves which of the two options is best for them; pro-lifers say there should only be one option, and women should be convinced, coerced, or forced into that option. 

Ultimately, pro-lifers want to convince and coerce women who are afraid of, uncomfortable with, or unsure of carrying until term and childbirth, to be okay with all of it. Those that can’t be convinced, will simply be forced to gestate against their will.",t2_5pzwj0fx,1619542411,prochoice

A lot of pro-lifers are Christian, I'm not anymore so correct me if I'm wrong but I think that Christians believe aborted fetuses go to heaven. Why would you not want them to go to heaven? Especially considering the alternative. If the pro-lifer is atheist and believes we all just disappear into nothing like I do, then the fetus won't be able to care that it's dead like the rest of us won't. If you believe in reincarnation, can't the fetus's soul just... go into another fetus? I'm not too familiar with other religions' belief on aborted fetuses. And I know atheists don't all believe our souls just go poof when we oof but I can't think of anything else I can remember an atheist saying they believe after death, or even anything else an atheist could believe.

How pro lifers try and control the debate,"This has probably been pointed out a lot, but I just wanted to talk about something most pro lifers do online and IRL when discussing abortion.

Ultimately, the abortion debate comes down to one question: is government restriction of abortion justified?

However, pro lifers try and frame the debate around a very different question: Is an embryo/fetus a person/alive?

They try and 'trap' you by controlling the debate to make it seem as though if you answer yes to that question, the debate is over and they've won. However, this doesn't work because they \*already\* think abortion is wrong, and they're just working backwards to justify it. In their minds, if fetuses are people, that means abortion is wrong, which means it should be illegal. But there's a whole bunch of steps to get from 'fetuses are people' to 'abortion should be illegal'. Pro lifers either ignore those steps, or do their best to make it seem as though they aren't there. Because those steps are where the real debate is to be had.

It's why you'll often see them use statements such as 'life begins at conception', 'abortion is killing' or 'fetuses are babies' as arguments. They aren't actually arguments at all. 'Abortion is wrong because life begins at conception' isn't an argument.

For me, the key thing is the difference between believing something is wrong and believing it should be illegal. I know plenty of people who think abortion is wrong and wouldn't ever get one themselves, but they don't support making it illegal. Which kind of blows a massive hole in PL's 'life begins at conception therefore abortion should be illegal' thing.",t2_8lje7nkm,1619359116,prochoice
A “true” Christian should be pro-choice(?),"I’ve been thinking about how some people say that it’s wrong to undergo abortion because it’s against their religion and the Bible. However, if I recall correctly, the Bible has many messages about love in it, including something like “love your neighbour as you love yourself”. 

In my opinion love is respectful and unconditional - that being said, if you love your “neighbour” and they want to do something you do not approve of, is it respectful to take away their right to choose? As a loving person, you can offer advice, your point of view, support, but you can never take away their choice. If you don’t love them no matter their choice, your love was never real, as it was conditional to your personal beliefs. 

( This would apply to anything that stereotypically some Christians do not approve of, including LGBTQ+ rights.)

Also, if I recall correctly, the Bible says “do not judge or else you will be judged” - which again makes me think that Christians, according to the Bible, should not have a say in what other people do, no matter how much they disapprove of it. 

This leaves me with the conclusion, that Christians, even according to the Bible, should be pro-choice.

I do not know too much about the Bible, so I am curious about what you have to say about this - am I interpreting these verses wrongly? Are there any other verses that would contradict what these say? Do you agree/disagree with me? Let’s discuss!",t2_a89ai125,1619355998,prochoice

And the “first off, we don’t kill them” thing they say is stupid. You’re not actually helping anyone. You’re not helping the ZEF, because how’s removing something that’s completely unaware and has no idea what existence even is, and is unwanted, not helpful? You’re not helping the mother/AFAB person, you’re simply insisting that they endure pain. You’re not helping yourself, because it’s got nothing to do with you.

That person will have to carry it for nine whole months, knowing it was conceived from rape, giving birth will just be more traumatic. 

now i like how when i bring this up, anti-choices are like ""oh, yeah i care about the person raped, however, the 'baby' matters and they shouldn't be 'killed' just because they were raped"" or say ""oh that's an exception, they should be able to get an abortion.""

now how would you feel about a child? a literal fucking child, a grown child that got pregnant from rape. i like how when i bring that up they go silent. or they're like ""oh that's an exception, they should be able to get an abortion.""


now what's the difference between a pregnancy that was conceived in rape and one that was conceived in consensual sex? NOTHING. 


so if you go around basically saying people who had sex consensually shouldn't get abortions but people who've been raped should, you're an idiot. if you say that rape victims should have to give birth, literally fuck you. just fuck you. shame on you.

"I think I finally figured out just what it is about ""pro-lifers"" that pisses me off so much","This is going to be a long, personal and probably swear word heavy rant, just a forewarning.

I've been pro-choice for as long as I can remember, I could never quite wrap my head around people that wanted to take away reproductive rights from people based on their own feelings and moral compass. I could understand why the idea of abortion might upset them on a surface level, but I always viewed it as a ""necessary evil"". Not everyone wants children, and no everyone wants to inflict potential permanent damage to their body for the sake of giving birth to unwanted child (and that's a whole 'nother can of worms right there on the morality of forcing someone to give birth). Our own lives often depend upon the unfortunate suffering of others after all, we need to eat life in order to live ourselves, much of what we own and use in the Western world was produced by those in less ideal living conditions, etc. But I digress.

Out of everyone who's pretty much on the extreme opposite end of me politically, ""pro-lifers"" have always been the ones to piss me off the most. I often believed it was simply because of their holier than thou attitude, and their hatred of women/AFABs. But I think I've finally figured out just what it is about ""pro-life"" people that gets under my skin the most, and as I often suspected but could never quite place, it is for personal reasons.

I don't remember how but I recently stumbled across a post of someone ranting about their relative getting an abortion. I didn't read the whole thing, but I read enough that something in me ""snapped"" so to speak and I realised ""oh right, this is why I dislike so called 'pro-lifers' so much"". In short, their lack of utter empathy. I've heard so many stories from ""pro-lifers"" vilifying people, even those close to them such as friends or family, for having abortions, doesn't matter the reasons why, they don't give a shit. Yet they cry over their ""unborn relative"" or whatever being ""murdered""? Are you fucking shitting me?

I (an only child) grew up with an abusive mother, one who often told me how much she wish she had an abortion. She only ""loved"" me when it was convenient for her, I wasn't convenient for her otherwise, her love was very much, and still is, conditional. She's always been the kind of person who ""loves"" animals, and the reason I put that in quotations is because she's the kind of ""animal lover"" who doesn't actually care about animals, she just likes the ""feelgood"" feeling of acting like she cares.

A few years back, she let her cat become pregnant by letting her outside when she wasn't neutered. Nearly a year later, she still has the kittens and none of them have been neutered. One is female, the rest are male. Female kitten gets constantly harassed by the males, I keep telling her she needs to neuter those cats, but it's always excuse after excuse as to why she can't, usually money related, but she seems to be able to afford fancy cat food and beds just fine. Obviously, female kitten ends up impregnated by her brothers. Pretty much everyone is telling her to have the kittens aborted, even the vets, there's already too many cats in one house, and there's a chance the kittens could have issues from being inbred. She doesn't care, she can't abort them because ""they're living things"". So the kittens are born, one dies within 2 weeks and then she promptly gives up the mother cat and the rest of the kittens to an animal shelter because ""she can't deal with any more heartbreak"".

I just couldn't, I remember how pissed I was over that. One of her older cats got cancer and she basically just let her die, she let this 8 month old cat get impregnated by her brothers, and suddenly it's only the kittens she cares about? If she actually gave a flying fuck about the cats and their wellbeing, they would have been neutered and otherwise properly cared for years back. She pretty much just gives them beds, water, and dry food left out for weeks and that's really the extent of the care she gives them, she rarely even gives them any attention.

And it's the same with so many ""pro-lifers"". They just don't seem to give a flying fuck about the actual living, breathing people around them, only those convenient for them to ""care"" about because the unborn don't have wants, emotional needs or really anything that makes actual people... Well, actual people.

Imagine how much their ""empathetic"" asses could achieve if they put all their energy into helping foster kids, the homeless, those in needs, even just being supportive of their friends and family, even when they make choices they don't always agree with. But nope, it's all about feeling good for them, never about actually doing good, never about actually trying to help people, just feeling proud of themselves for dictating to people what to do with their own bodies is good enough for them, they don't need to think any further than that. ""Babies"" being ""murdered"" makes them feel bad, so therefore people that do that must be bad. Period.

“Foetuses Are People And Abortion Is Murder”: All Pro-Life reasoning is the same circular logic...,"I've just been thinking about this for a while recently, and I feel like I need to post a rant just to confirm that I’m surely not the only one who thinks ""Abortion is murder"" and ""Foetuses are people"" aren't just wrong... but meaningless.

I always get so frustrated trying to ""debate"" pro-life adherents or when I'm watching or reading others in pro-choice/pro-life debates because they refuse to acknowledge it when I argue that these assertions wouldn't change my view on abortion either way... even if they are true.

These only make sense as foundational arguments for banning or strictly limiting access to abortion if you already accept that abortion is wrong. i.e. It's circular reasoning.

""Abortion is murder"" doesn't necessarily say anything about abortion on a moral level (unless you already believe it's wrong); it just *trivialises murder*.  
Even if I accept it's true, all it does is shift the question from ""Is *abortion* wrong?"" to ""Is murder *always* wrong?""

""Foetuses are people"" doesn't say anything about foetuses being in need of legal protection as a protected class; it just waters down the meaning of ""personhood"" to the point of irrelevancy in nearly any legal or moral argument.

You could use the same shitpost-level logic but in reverse to make all sort of gibberish propositions:

""*Yes, I stabbed her through the heart, killing her in cold blood, your honour. But I beg your forgiveness and understanding. After all, it's no worse than getting an abortion.""*

It's almost like ""Abortion is murder"" and ""Foetuses are people"" only make sense as arguments if you start out already believing abortion is wrong and need to work backwards to find justification for it, but they're still considered Gospel in the pro-life sub.

It actually makes the pro-life/pro-choice debate all the more frustrating because it seems so many can't help but play into the pro-life philosophy framing of the debate. It's a complete waste of time to counter-argue that ""Abortion is not murder"" (even though, ya know, it isn't) because it just plays into their framing of the issue. The response should be, ""So what? All that would prove is murder is okay sometimes.""

A philosophy has to actually be applicable in some sense in order to be useful as part of a worldview. It doesn't make sense to debate whether foetuses are people, because there's nothing I can practically do with that information without opening up a whole host of other moral issues. 

A foetus is a person? Great. But they are still living inside of another person's body, *and there's simply no way around that!*",t2_7mqkxsuq,1619201590,prochoice

"Pro lifer are simply people who can’t accept that not everyone shares their personal morals, it’s not about abortion.","If they truly believe “abortion is murder” in the same sense that stabbing an individual is murder then why aren’t they doing everything they physically can to stop it? Why are they simply being internet trolls and shouting “abortion is murder” outside clinics, why aren’t they running in and physically stopping the abortion? 
*because they know that would be an overreaction, as they know abortion isn’t murder in the same way a stabbing a person to death would be murder* 
Because For them it’s about forcing their personal morals on everyone else, they cannot accept that other may have different personal morals. 

It’s okay to believe abortion is morally wrong, just as murder is morally wrong, but when enough people don’t believe abortion is morally wrong you should just accept that not everyone shares your personal morals and move on. In the same way you shouldn’t berate a whole religion because it’s not your own. 

Pro-lifers are a bunch of children throwing their toys out the pram because others don’t share their ideology. I doubt that abortion ever effects them, I doubt they cry or feel sad when they hear about an abortion, like you would if you hear about someone being murdered on the news. Because it’s not about the act of abortion it’s about the roll it plays in their ideology.

Pathological psychology of prolifers; Prolifers have very little empathy or sympathy for women who want or get abortions,"Just wanted to make a post exploring this topic.
It is pretty common knowledge that a lot of prolifers seem to not understand how pregnancy affects women or may affect certain women more negatively than others.Also how blocking abortion would affect women in general.

I wanted to explore two pathological psychological traits. The two I wanted to look at are deficits or lack of empathy and sympathy. These are both components of ASPD (antisocial personality disorder) and NPD (narcisistic personality disorder).
Empathy means understanding what the person is going through and being able to understand the situation from their perspective. It is essentially perspective taking. Sympathy means being able to experience the feelings of another.

Anyways now we got definitions out of the way, prolifers are incapable of empathy (perspective taking) of how blocking abortion will affect women, many openly stating things similar to ""it would affect them how it affects any criminal that can't commit a crime"".
They literally can not think or understand the impacts on the woman; financially, socially, medically, psychologically.

Secondly they do not experience any sympathy for women who have or want abortions. They do not feel bad for any suffering the woman may be going through. Even often if women state they had medical issues during the pregnancy or literally could not afford a baby.

Thirdly many display callousness toward women who want or had abortion. 
Ie not caring if women are hurt as long as the prolifer gets what they want, a living fetus/banned abortion.
Callousness is also a trait of psychopathy/ASPD.
This also includes not feeling remorse for the suffering of women or deaths due to abortion being banned.
Many outright say that they prefer if the woman dies as well from the abortion and that it would serve them right.

Lastly prolifers engage in dehumanization of women who want or had abortions. They see them as ""less than human"" and behaving in an animalistic and savage way. This is apparent by the way many repeatedly refer to them as ""killers"", ""murderers"", ""sinners"" etc.
Animalistic dehumanisation which implies a group is evil or less than human is used as a psychological war tactic to get soldiers to masacre people without questioning authority. Systematic devaluation of the victim provides a measure of psychological justification for brutal treatment of the 
victim and has been the constant accompaniment of massacres, pogroms, and wars.

The pro-life movement = egotism masquerading as altruism,"Pro-lifers love to tell us they cannot mind their own business and leave pregnant people alone to make their own decisions because they’re just so gosh-darned altruistic.  They say they’re compelled to intrude on others‘ personal lives only because they care so much about protecting “precious innocent unborn babies.”  They’re not selfish like pro-choice people, they say.  They can’t sit idly by and let people “murder their babies.”

But don’t be fooled.  What’s really going on with pro-life is pure egotism, and it’s pretty easy to see through their attempts to make it look like altruism instead.

Examples:

— They think “what if your mother had aborted you?!” is a stunning gotcha question that will change people’s minds.  Why?  Because they have an overinflated sense of their own importance, and the idea of the world existing just fine without them ever having been born is too much for them to contemplate.  Most of them are also religious and believe their existence is essential to the fabric of the universe, predetermined by a supreme being.

— They consider themselves the ultimate authorities on morality and therefore think it’s obvious that everyone else should be required to do as they say.  They‘ve decided women‘s bodies are public commodities to be used for a “greater good” they’ve come up with and then act shocked that any women would reject that notion.

— They are dripping with judgment and eager to punish anyone who doesn’t share their values or follow their rules.  They don’t show any compassion or empathy for people who‘ve ever deviated from their rules; instead they’re positively gleeful anytime they see someone have to “face the consequences” of breaking them.     

— They expect to receive credit and praise for doing absolutely nothing.  Well, okay - some of them are willing to pray a rosary or yell “murderer!” at women outside clinics.  Most of them are also willing to vote for any politician who claims they’re “pro-life,” no matter how incompetent and corrupt they may be otherwise.  But that’s the extent of it - otherwise they believe that simply saying “I want to protect the unborn” is enough to make them a good, ethical, altruistic person.  They don’t see any need to actually get their hands dirty, or to understand and connect with people who are not like them. They don’t care about anyone’s happiness or quality of life — not even the children they “saved,” after they’re born.  They are not interested in building a better world for anyone.  They just want their rules to be followed, goddamnit, because they are superior to the rest of us, they are the authorities, and what they want is the only thing that matters.

Let's protect access to abortion in TX,"[Six anti-abortion bills are moving through the Texas state legislature, including one that would essentially ban abortion in Texas if it becomes law.](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/07/texas-house-abortion/) I've seen a bunch of posts about the bills on this subreddit, and I'm glad people are paying attention.

**Texas abortion funds need our help.** The organizations that fight abortion bans in court are well-funded, but it's small abortion funds who are out on the front lines helping Texans pay for their procedures ($700-$2500+) and get to their clinic appointments. When restrictive laws pass, their work gets more complicated and more expensive. These groups depend on individual donations, but the big annual fundraiser for abortion funds (Fund-A-Thon) ends on April 30 and most Texas funds are still several thousand dollars short of their goals.

**r/ Prochoicers, you can help turn this around by raising money for a Texas abortion fund**. Fundraising can be as simple as getting five friends to contribute $10 each, sharing a donation request on your social media pages, or asking your loved ones to chip in for a birthday/special occasion fundraiser. If you can't fundraise, please donate using one of the links below—together we can make a huge difference.

# How to Fundraise for Fund-a-Thon

1. **Pick an organization** from the list below or choose [from more than 70 other funds in the US](https://fundathon.nnaf.org/)
2. **Make a fundraising page:** click “Become A Fundraiser” and either join as an individual (usually easiest) or join an existing team. If you have friends who are fundraising with you, you can choose to “create a team” and then send everyone a link so that they can make their own page - *I really want to make a fundraising team for this subreddit, so comment if you’re down &amp; I’ll send you a link!*
3. **Set a goal for how much money you want to raise.** Here are some suggestions: $250 covers gas and a hotel room for someone who has to stay overnight between appointments—$520 covers a round-trip flight for an abortion at a clinic out of state—$700 covers the cost of a consultation, ultrasound, and first-trimester abortion in Austin— $2500 covers the cost of an abortion near the gestational limit. *Remember, anything you raise makes a big difference.*
4. **Be the first to pitch in.** If you have any money to spare, even just a few dollars, make the first donation to your own fundraising page. Donating to your own fundraiser kicks things off and shows that you’re committed to the cause.
5. **Ask for donations from as many people in your network as you can.** People are more likely to donate if you ask them individually and let them know why this cause is important to you. I'll put some sample requests in the comments to make it easier. After a friend donates, shower them with thank-yous and ask them to share the fundraising request with their networks to get more matching donations.

# TX Abortion &amp; Practical Support Funds

Abortion funds help people pay for their abortion procedures. Some funds provide practical support (help with getting to the clinic, like arranging travel or paying for gas, bus/plane tickets, hotel stays, etc). Here's a list of suggested organizations that you can fundraise for in just a few clicks.

[**LILITH FUND**](https://fund.nnaf.org/campaign/lilith-fund-2021/c323448)

Most people who cite Christianity as a cause for being pro life probably haven't read the Bible completely,"I suggest everyone to read the X Rated Bible. It's available online.

The following passage is quoted from Chapter IX of the aforementioned book:

Moreover there is no mention of abortion in the bible anywhere. 

&gt;**If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the womans husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe**

This is the sole Biblical mention of abortion, and as one can decipher from the text, it really is an argument against a man injuring a pregnant woman and inducing a miscarriage, nothing more.

It is important to note that abortion was only considered to be a serious offense if it resulted in the death o f the mother. This was the prevailing view for many centuries, even in the early Church.

It was Tertullian (A.D. 160—230) who first gave rise to the notion that the Bible specifically prohibits abortion, and his authority for his view of abortion being a crime was this very text quoted above. Tertullian then proceeded to expound his doctrine that the fetus became animated only after forty days if it was a male and after eighty days if it was a female. This was a moot point since there was no wav to determine the sex o f the fetus until after birth. And it should be noted that “animation” or “quickening” was not the same as viability. In the former case, it was when the soul entered the fetus; in the latter case, it was the point at which the fetus could survive outside the womb. 

Jerome, who translated this text from Exodus into Latin from the original Hebrew, perpetuated this error although he should have known better. The subject was then bandied about among the early Church fathers who expressed many different points of view on when the fetus became animated, whether there was a difference between therapeutic abortion as opposed to abortion for convenience and whether it was the mother or the abortionist who was guilty of a crime. 

The turning point came in 1869 with Pope Pius IX's pronouncement that abortion was always a grave moral offense and that anyone guilty of being associated with this crime was to be excommunicated. Since Pius IX had already enunciated the doctrine of papal infallibility, his fiat on abortion carried great weight.

Pius IX had also decreed in 1854 that Mary was free from original sin “in the first instant o f her conception” and the idea soon gained currency that a soul was formed at the moment o f conception and that while contraception merely prevented the formation o f a new soul, abortion actually destroyed an already-formed soul, a belief held today not only by Roman Catholics, but also by many fundamentalists and orthodox Jews. This position views all abortions as murder and allows no exceptions.",t2_5gylg0g,1619084813,prochoice

Abortion would be a less controversial topic if parenting weren’t overglorified.,"Parenting and pregnancy are overglorified as hell in today’s society.

Bullshit! Some people don’t want to have kids, and unwanted pregnancy results in divorce, financial instability, and the rest of your life doomed. The nine months of pregnancy are full of pain, headaches, nausea, emotional breakdowns, and physical limitations.

&gt;""Many parents of children in non-IV-E foster care have financial resources to pay child support on behalf of their child. Since, unlike traditional child support cases, children in foster care have two absent parents, States can increase collections by pursuing child support from both parents. States also can increase child support collections through better management of the child support collection process. Management of the process should include collecting information on all parents of children in non-IV-E foster care, referring the parents to child support agencies, establishing support orders and actually collecting child support payments.

D-did I read this right? (Taken from r/prolife),"My sister had an abortion, and I don't think I could ever forgive her for it.

Hi, everyone. I'm a long-time lurker of this sub, but only created an account because I just need some place to vent and be comforted. I honestly can't stop crying. 

Yesterday I found out my sister had an abortion two years ago. I was sitting with my mother at the dinner table when we were talking about children. I told my mom about how I've always wanted kids and how I discussed this with my boyfriend (I'm 23, by the way). We then talked about my older sister, who is now 28 but was 26 at the time of her getting an abortion. I talked with my mom about how nice it would be if I had a niece or nephew, but of course that wasn't my decision to be made. My mom nodded and then said, ""Yeah..too bad \[sister\] got that abortion.""

That's when I stopped chewing on my food. I asked my mother what she was talking about. My mom explained to me that, two years ago, my sister found out she was pregnant  after she had missed her period. She has a boyfriend and takes birth control, but my mother said the birth control failed at the time. She then said that my sister discussed it with her boyfriend, and they both agreed she should get an abortion since she's a medical student and cannot afford to be pregnant. 

At first I was angry with my mom for even allowing her to get an abortion, but my mom said when my sister informed her, she pleaded and begged her not to do that. But my sister didn't listen, didn't care about killing her own child, and got an abortion anyway. I asked her why I wasn't told any of this, and my mom said she thought I knew. 

I felt like crying right then and there. I didn't know what to think of my sister. I was shaking. I went up to my room, closed the door, and started crying. After a while, I drove to my sister's place and demanded answers from her. 

She said she didn't want to tell me because she knew how I'd react. I  was so furious; my own niece/nephew was murdered and I wasn't made aware?? I tried my best to stay calm though. I asked my sister why she couldn't have put the baby up for adoption, since she's a med student and I understand she wouldn't have been able to take care of them. She said that she didn't want to go through with the pregnancy and didn't want it to affect her body. She talked about how she didn't want to walk around school with a ""huge belly"", and didn't want her classmates asking about her pregnancy. She mentioned that pregnancy and its ""effects"" would have ruined her grades or she would have had to switch to online classes to avoid being seen by her classmates.

That's when I lost it. I couldn't stop myself from screaming at her. I told my sister that she killed her own child for her own comfort, that pregnancy and its ""effects"" aren't severe enough to ruin her grades. I told her that she murdered her own child for her own convenience. I told her that my mom and I would have been 100% supportive if she had kept the baby, we would've taken her to every medical check-up, given her the best care, everything she could have asked for to make sure the pregnancy goes smoothly. I told her she could've explained to her professors that she was pregnant and to be a bit more lenient on her, since I understand that pregnancy is not easy. She told me that medical school is not easy and she needed all the time in the world to focus and keep her grades up, and that pregnancy would have ""deteriorated"" her mental health (as if pregnancy is some sort of mental illness). I told her she knows there's a chance of pregnancy when one has sex, so she should've known that one day she would get pregnant. But she said none of that matters because she just ""didn't want to go through with it"". 

I was so angry and upset. I gave my sister all the different ways she could have dealt with this, but she chose the evil way: murdering her child. She chose her comfort, her desires, over her own child. She chose to kill my niece/nephew. 

That's when I told my sister I'm never speaking to her again; I cannot speak with someone who murders an innocent life. I walked out the door and went back home. 

I believe modern society has ruined women. Instead of embracing their bodies, what their body can do, and embracing pregnancy, women are now taught to hate children, to loathe pregnancy and treat it like some sort of illness. Women are now taught to have reckless sex without accepting its consequences, and to murder babies for their own convenience or whenever they feel like it. Women are now taught that murdering children is ""empowering"" and that they don't even need a reason to do it. Pregnancy is such a beautiful and amazing thing, and it's sickening to me that some women murder their own children just because they don't like the idea of pregnancy. My sister may have not liked pregnancy, but why did she have to punish her own child for that? Does her child not have the right to live? Women are now taught to be selfish, cold-hearted baby killers.

My sister and I were on good terms before this; we had a normal relationship. I want to note that I'm not religious by any means; my entire family consists of atheists. But I don't see how religion would even be relevant since you don't need to believe in a god to know that murdering babies is wrong; you just need a heart and common sense. So before any lurking pro-choicers come at me and tell me I'm ""forcing religious views"", I'm not at all.

Anyways, I'm sorry if this post was so long. I just needed to vent and let it all out. I'm not sure how to move on from here. I'm still so shaken up after finding out my own sister is a baby killer. How do I deal with this? What can I do to move on? How do I feel better? Do I try to forgive my sister? Thank you.",t2_6k2gae65,1619036555,prochoice

I desperately need opinions.,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to be posting this but I desperately need some opinions. 

I just found out I’m pregnant. 

Back story: I’m 23 and in a healthy relationship. I’ve always loved raves &amp; festivals. I was dealing with a lot of things for 5 years and never really had a friend group. Now that I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years I have grown very close to his friend group. I have only been to a festival with my boyfriend once before Covid shut everything down. I have never actually experienced festivals/life. I didn’t drink until 2 years ago and I never partied in high school. 

I have never really experienced what most young people have in high school, college etc. 

I have all these plans to go to festivals and travel to different places with my boyfriend and our friends. I have my EDC Orlando ticket already bought and was planning to go this year as it falls on my birthday. 

On the other hand I have always felt that I could never go through with abortion myself. I am pro-choice but I feel that with myself I would regret it immensely and always have those “what if’s?”. I was told I couldn’t get pregnant and the fact that I did when it was unplanned is kind of a miracle in itself. I know I would be a great mom and that isn’t ideal but you’re never truly ready to be a parent and 23 isn’t super young. 


So basically what I’m trying to get at is do you really think my rave/party life would be over once the child is here? 
Are there any parents that still find time to get loose?
Is there anyway to make that work? Everyone is telling me my life will change and I won’t want to party anymore but I feel like my boyfriend and I will be still raving until we’re 50 LOL. I obviously know it’s going to change big time but does your life truly change in the fact that you can’t fit festivals or events or drinking nights in? Is it do-able? 

I know it sounds horrible that I’m seriously thinking of raves, but it’s a huge part of my boyfriend and I’s life and I’m stuck trying to decide. I really need some opinions. They will be greatly appreciated. 💖",t2_5a7ivju9,1618987412,prochoice

Help me see it your way,"Ok so most prochoice people I know tend to say that the baby is not a baby at fertilization.  I can understand the arguements that it is still a part of the mothers body, or at least I think I do.  However, I cant refute that the baby is teleologically going to be a baby.  And from the time of fertilization the chemical process begins to create the baby, right? I mean I am open for alternative explanations.  But what gets me is that it is all conjecture from both sides. Because both sides dont 100% know that the fertilized egg isnt a baby or that it is.  Which is why the debate continues.  If its not a baby then fuck lets go ham on making lives better.  But if it is a baby or even if there is a chance at all, wouldnt the logically safest plan be to just let it completely grow in the general case.  

If you say that you know it is not a baby you have to base it on criteria that you can agree is accurate and precise. But that criteria seems to always still be subjective and well not 100% when taking into account other explanations. I would say that the teleological argument still can defuse scientific explanation of consciousness that most prochoice people in my experience tend to agree with. Because i think that conciousness does not determine life.

Pro lifers and arguing from disgust,"Pro lifers love to talk about how 'gross' abortions are. They're constantly telling everyone how fetuses are 'torn limb from limb' in a disgusting, bloody act of barbarism. I've seen a lot of them express the sentiment that if people truly understood what an abortion looks like, they would be against it. There was a recent post in the PL sub saying that children should be taught about abortion procedures in sex ed (presumably only the icky surgical ones, not the medical ones which are pretty uneventful and wouldn't get their message across). They think if the children see videos of the procedure or pictures of aborted fetuses, they will know abortion is wrong.

First of all, I think it's pretty naive of them to assume that the only reason people are pro choice is because they don't know what an abortion looks like. Second, they're forgetting that almost every invasive medical procedure is gross as hell. Nobody wants to see videos of open heart surgery, but that doesn't mean it's immoral.

However, my biggest problem with this argument from disgust is that they completely forget that what the pregnant woman endures in childbirth is far worse. To me, it makes no sense to say 'abortion is bad because it's bloody and painful for the fetus' and then turn around and support forcing women to give birth to every pregnancy. By their own logic, forced birth should also be morally wrong. And I say that birth is worse because it lasts longer and the woman is actually Cognizant and aware of her suffering, unlike a fetus. It's debatable if fetuses can even feel pain at all in the womb.

I think it's disgusting that they feel so much sympathy for a nonsentient fetus being aborted, but none at all for a very much sentient woman giving birth against her will. If you point this out to them, they will usually say 'but pregnancy and childbirth are natural' or 'the woman had sex, so it's her fault, she's just facing the consequences of her actions'.

Fund Abortion Access in the Midwest!,"Hello Everyone- I am part of Midwest Access Coalition, a practical support organization assisting folks in accessing abortion care. We are currently fundraising to be able to provide uninterrupted support, and I wanted to share our [organization's fundraising page](https://fund.nnaf.org/campaign/practical-support-is-magic-2021/c325582). 

***We support folks traveling to, from, and within the Midwest access safe, legal abortion with support in several areas: travel coordination and costs, lodging, food, childcare, medicine, and emotional support.*** 

MAC has recognized since its inception that there is no choice if there is no access. 

* As Black, Indigenous, and people of color, we face disproportionate access to abortion care based on our ethnicities, incomes, zip codes and ancestries- that is not 'choice.' 
* Pregnant minors are forced to get consent from their parents or face a judge- that is not 'choice.' 
* Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Kentucky have two or less abortion providers- that is not 'choice.'
* When there are only four independent clinics in all of North America, an entire continent, that provide 3rd trimester abortion care-  that is not 'choice.'

All of these affect individuals trying to access abortion care in the United States, and force people into giving birth. 

***Since 2015, MAC has supported over 1,600 abortion seekers from 29 states plus international spaces- if we really lived in a world with 'choice', people would not need to seek out funding to achieve basic reproductive support.*** 

We live in a world that almost universally criminalizes true reproductive autonomy, while embracing misogyny and turns a blind eye to sexual abuse. Through practical support organization like MAC, abortion funds, local community partners, and our mutual aid networks, we can support those who would otherwise be cutoff from care. No one should ever be forced, at any stage in a pregnancy, to give birth.

"I am so fucking tired of the ""ordinary care"" argument","I just want to rant for a moment about how much I hate the ""gestation is ordinary care"" argument that  some PL'ers make. If you are unfamiliar with this argument, it basically means that because every human who is alive today was once a fetus that had to be gestated in their mother's uterus, that means gestation falls under the category of ""ordinary"" rather than ""extraordinary"" care. Many PL'ers are not on board with mandatory organ donation because they consider it ""extraordinary"" care; if you donate an organ you're going above and beyond and it should never be required of people to do - because requiring a donated organ is not the ""natural state"" of most humans. But once someone is pregnant, gestating that ZEF is ""ordinary care"" and thus they should be required to do it.

I hate this argument for several reasons. First and foremost, it further serves to trivialize the effects of pregnancy and childbirth. If preserving the life of a born person resulted in regular nausea and vomiting, loss of teeth or hair, moving around of organs, abdominal muscles separating, lifelong incontinence and/or back pain, pelvic organ prolapse, and either having your genitals torn or your abdomen sliced open, that would not be ordinary care and you'd be considered a hero if you were willing to do that for someone. But pregnant people are expected to suffer all of this like it's no big deal. Forced birthers think that a ZEF is entitled to inflict this suffering on the pregnant person because that is just its basic need. To me, anyone is justified in protecting their own body from these horrible outcomes, even if it means that someone else is denied ""basic care"" as a result.

The second reason I hate the ordinary care argument is that it feels like a combination of naturalistic fallacy and the misogynistic ""she had sex, so it's her fault the ZEF is dependent on her body!"". This also ties into the ""the uterus is the natural environment for the ZEF, it's the only place it can live so it belongs there!"" But my view as a pro-choicer is that ZEFs are not entitled to anyone's body. We are free to deny use of our bodies to anyone, even if they would die without it.",t2_59fxqf,1618501044,prochoice

You can't be a feminist and against abortion.,"I spent some time on the pro-life sub, mostly to entertain myself and partially to see what kind of logic  and scientific argument were being used.

So after analysing the page I found it boils down to two arguments for pro-lifers.

1 - Abortion is Murder

2 - it's against God's will.

These seem to be the only constant argument made on their page. So the reason for this post, is to engage in a discussion with either pro-life or pro-choice in regards to being a feminist while being anti-abortion.
Logically I believe the two to be contradictory in many ways.

One specific argument I saw on the pro-life page was in regards to complete female autonomy and the freedom women are deserving of which was then followed by the contradiction that abortion should be criminal and illegal.

The idea of complete autonomy is that you are the prime controller of all things that happen, reside, enter and go through your body.

I consider the idea of feminism to be female autonomy and equality of opportunity.

I find it contrary to feminism to ban abortion.

Feeling hopeless,"You probably know me from my previous post about sources for an essay, well now I'm feeling hopeless.

TW: suicidal thoughts, self harm, maybe more?

So, for some insight(?) I'm an autistic minor, who is abnormally sensitive, I've also had a bit of history with self harm and suicidal thoughts which hit in waves(?) Which my mom knows about. I'm maybe paranoid because I'm always scared that all gossip is about me since my peers seem focus and on nothing but drama as if it will actually matter when they're older. 

I dont see myself as normal, and I doubt myself and second guess myself a lot, for some reason when I think of killing myself I visualise cutting myself and other ways of self harm. I've been through a lot from losing my dad when I was younger to maybe being gaslighted by my older brother but Im never able to tell for sure, I'm not a very interesting person in my opinion, I keep to myself and am very quiet in public, I tend to see myself as ungrateful because I dont know how to appreciate anything I have because I'm not normal. I really have no faith in humanity, especially in the U.S. after hearing about all of the cruel people that exist all over the world, I've never truly known who I am, or understood myself, I only know and somewhat understand what others have told me.

I haven't presented yet and I may ask my teacher if I can opt out, or just fail it entirely since it is taking a toll on my mental health. Today I went back to school after being sick Monday and yesterday, and in my English class, I did everything normally and I heard to guys who are infatuated with Trump (dunno their party) talking about what I assume is me because one of them said ""she's pro-abortion"" and something about lib-tards (liberals), but I've never liked politics because I hate arguing and some people can be obsessive and extreme, so I dont even know a party that I would fit in. 


I don't know what caused my those thoughts to come in but they hit like a truck and I had to use my only normal people coping mechanisms, listening to music, scrolling through my phone and biting the inside of my mouth because it gives me something else to focus on when I cant use my phone or earbuds and I dont know other ways. I tried talking to my mom about my thoughts, whenever I do this I get scared about my future for some reason, I asked her ""How am I gonna get anywhere? What am I gonna do? I dont even know who I am"" I think about about how I dont have a job or that I'm supposed to be smart and not make mistakes, about some of the problems that go on in society and the fact that I likely won't be able to fix them. So anyway she responded by saying ""You are (age). Don't worry about it."" And ""Enjoy being young."" I don't know how to enjoy my youth, going outside is a health hazard and can require me to socialize which I hate doing, and I dont know what to do outside of school other than watch YouTube for the rest of the day. I had to keep myself from crying until I got home because crying in public, especially in high school is something that causes me to get pity, or even gossiped about and made out to be a snowflake baby, it makes me feel more like a burden than I already am.

Why am I writing this here? I feel like I have nowhere else to go, I feel like I have no one irl to talk to.

I have a question from a Pro-Life/Choicer,"Hi!

I also posted this on the Pro-Life subreddit and I'm not here or interested in debating. I just wanted to have opinions from both sides of the spectrum. 

Please no hate or anything, I just have a question.

So I have been on the Abortion Debate Subreddit, the only problem I've had is that Pro-choices are saying I'm Pro-choice and not Pro-Life.

I'm very confused. 

For now I have changed my flair on that subreddit to 'unsure' and 'Pro-Compromise'

The reason they are saying this is because I don't think Abortion should be banned just very limited and rare. But, I don't support Abortion, so I'm not sure how that would make me Pro-Choice and not Pro-Life.

Can anyone please explain this. 

Here are some beliefs I have, so you can have a better understanding:

I believe Life begins at conception.

I don't think abortion should be banned.

I don't think taxes should fund abortion.

Abortion should be prevented at all costs.

Abortion should be reserved for high-risk and rape victims. However, anyone that wants an abortion should be having a long discussion with someone (Not a money-hungry abortion doctor. My mother has had bad experiences with abortion doctors and she's Pro-Choice)

All teens should have parents permission (because of Sex-Trafficking). I'm on the fence with this one. 

Sex ED and birth control is fine. I don't care what anyone does in their sex life, as long as no one is hurt.

I value all life, even plants and animals. I would never eat or touch pork, turkey, beef, lamb, or chicken. (I do eat cheese and fish though). This can seem a bit contradicting. 

I believe that water and plant-life is sacred. I pray every night to the Earth. I don't worship it or anything, I just strongly value it as a Muslim .

And I'm Muslim. Happy Ramadan everyone!

So, if any Pro-Choices will (Respectfully) give me advice on what I should call myself.

Pro-lifers are discriminatory against Trans People,"When a pro-lifer asserts that they demand women stay pregnant, there's always the obvious assumption that they include anyone who was born female is a ""woman""--obviously, if you were trans or non-binary and got pregnant they would expect you to be forced to keep the fetus as well, no matter how badly this screws up your transition or physical health.

Taking testosterone means that there is a an extremely chance of miscarriage and lethal mutations. Therefore, it follows that if a society that outlaws abortion, if a trans man conceived he would have to be taken off testosterone and pumped on estrogen--forcefully so. 

I've seen pro-life people rightfully make exceptions for victims of sexual assault, incest, and people too young to care for children, but I've never, not once, seen them exclude trans men or non-binary people.",t2_7sz0qitx,1618420796,prochoice

Some people debate the point of viability because of the future possible existence of an artificial womb.

I hate how pro lifers act as if they have a monopoly on caring about human life,"Lurking on the PL sub, you so often see them describe their position with phrases such as 'I value human life'/ 'I understand that life is precious'. It's so fucking nauseating. As a pro choicer, I also value human life and think that it's precious, I just don't believe in torturing and abusing women to preserve it.

Here are just some of the ways I value human life:

\-Oppose the death penalty, and also excessive police brutality

\-Support social welfare systems that provide a better quality of life for everyone and better equip mothers to take care of their babies

\-Support healthcare that is free at the point of need

\-Donate to charities that help people facing crises such as war and starvation

\-Support environmentalist causes that protect the lives of humans as well as animals, for example by reducing pollution

What we say: 'My body, my choice'

What we mean: women should be able to choose not to carry pregnancies to term, because it is our bodies doing the gestating and birthing.

What PL thinks we mean: the baby is part of the woman's body/it's not an 'individual unique human'

--

What we say: 'Rape victims should always be allowed to abort'

What we mean: rape is violent abuse a woman's body, and forcing her to carry a resulting pregnancy to term is a continuation of that violent abuse.

What PL thinks we mean: babies conceived in rape are less valuable/don't deserve to live

--

What we say: 'pregnancy and birth should be consensual'

What we mean: pregnancy and birth are physically difficult for women, so if a woman decides she doesn't want to continue a pregnancy she should be allowed to abort

What PL thinks we mean: the baby has to ask the woman for consent

I will move away if TN passes the new Abortion Bill,"Abortion laws

They are looking at a bill that lets (alleged) father to say no to an abortion - with a catch of course, he can’t go back on his word. Even though he can’t go back on his word this is still a terrible idea.
A hard and touchy topic for everyone especially pro-lifers.
Before coming for my neck please watch the Handmaids tale and know that women’s rights to their own bodies are feared of being taken away.
Women should be able to get an abortion for whatever reason they choose because it is their body and dehumanizing to tell a woman what she can and can’t do with her body.
Men should not have a say so because it’s controlling and extremely dangerous. There are plenty of women in abusive relationships that have been brainwashed and/or are afraid to speak out. 
Scenario 1: The mother doesn’t want the child and is probably in the hospital seeking therapy because she was forced to carry a child she didn’t want to full term and since the father can’t have the mother he beats the child, which could kill it.
Rapists and abusers can easily control the woman because she doesn’t want him to harm the child and now she is stuck having to protect her child, it’s causing a lot more harm than good.
Scenario 2: The mother doesn’t want the child and is probably in the hospital seeking therapy because she was forced to carry a child she didn’t want to full term but can’t bring herself to leave her baby now has a heart full of love but can’t be there for the baby fully as she’s dealing with depression and body dysmorphia.
This has nothing to do with the father but the mother herself and why it’s unhealthy to force a woman to do something she doesn’t want to do and it’s extremely baffling why men still want to have children with a woman that says she doesn’t want to have it. It’s traumatizing and saddening the women have to beg for the rights to their own body. 
Six weeks isn’t enough time for a woman to tell if she’s pregnant when there are several things that could throw a woman’s period of track. Simple stress can throw off a woman’s period or taking birth control or emergency contraceptive could make her believe her period will be absent for a certain amount of time.
I can’t imagine being put in a position where I’m pregnant and want to keep but can’t because I have lost my home, job, or family that has made me feel incapable of providing for my child and not able to get an abortion because I’m passed six weeks or my partner wants to keep the baby.
I beg of you please don’t take away my rights. You can hate me all you want for having an abortion but it’s my body, not yours.",t2_8xq5ickr,1617869593,prochoice
Why I hate Live Action," Live Action is a pro-life organization. They always go too far like seemingly every pro-life organization. But honestly, this is the one pro-life organization that I think's the very definition of insane pro-life (most likely just as worse or even more worse than the pro-lifers in r/insaneprolife), even worse than going too far.

Just a fair warning that I'm on my computer writing this so I'm using the web browser TikTok, which its links aren't the same as mobile. It should work though since I used the copylink share thing but let me know if the links are broken and I'll fix them.

So some of pro-lifers I've seen are okay with abortions in the case of r\^pe/health conditions/etc. However, this organization doesn't seem to be fine with it. In fact, in one of the videos on their TikTok page, the organization says that abortions should still be illegal in r\^pe cases, because ""most abortions don't happen because of r\^pe, it's because women got pregnant at their own free will"" ([proof](https://www.tiktok.com/@liveactionorg/video/6925531873301024006?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6872515744716047878)).

A lot of arguments I've had with pro-lifers was ""r\^pe only happens one percent of the time in abortions, it should still be illegal because it doesn't deserve to pay for what the dad did!""

[This is the video where they got the reasoning from with the one percent.](https://www.tiktok.com/@liveactionorg/video/6925531873301024006?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6872515744716047878) (I already posted the video earlier in another link, but there's a repost lol.) **One percent of abortions definitely do not happen because of r\^pe.  It's definitely more than one percent. This would mean that they would've surveyed every single person who's gotten an abortion (safely or not) or known someone who has gotten an abortion and was willing to share their reasoning. Some people who got abortions aren't even alive anymore, so there's no way to know the actual percent and the one percent is most likely a false estimate! The one percent is false; it's only of the people surveyed.** I don't know the actual percent of people who got abortions because of r\^pe, but it's definitely more than one percent. Therefore the source they're using is false.

They also don't seem to care about the reason for abortion is. They just want it illegal. ([proof](https://www.tiktok.com/@liveactionorg/video/6927050240067505413?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6872515744716047878))

The problem with abortions being illegal is that women will get arrested for a miscarriage. Unless if she has proof that she had a miscarriage instead of an abortion in some way, then she'll go to jail for something she can't control. It's already happened in most Latin American countries, where abortion is restricted or completely illegal. [For example, a woman in El Salvador (where abortion is completely illegal) was sentenced to 30 years in prison for having a miscarriage.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/miscarriages-abortion-jail-el-salvador/)

The people running the LA account also seem to say ""wantedness does not define value"" when it comes to abortions (such as when women do not want to keep the pregnancy but there's other people who would want a baby from them if she were to keep the pregnancy). **How does that explain why there's so many kids left in foster cares or adopted just to be abused?**

Honestly, we don't need more people on this planet. Forcing people to keep pregnancies to overpopulate the earth is way too far. There's almost 8 billion people on the planet. Why does one person getting an abortion for any reason and/or not wanting kids make pro-lifers so mad? Like ""NOOO YOU CANT GET AN ABORTION THE POPULATION WILL DECREASE AND HUMANS WILL GO EXTINCT"".

Humans will not go extinct for a long time, even if we stopped reproducing. But if we keep reproducing then we won't have any more space to care for these kids.

Abortion can help stop the overpopulation and should just be normalized.

Don't mind me, had to rant about this stupid organization. I honestly really hope it gets shut down. Their merch is so cheesy and cringey too (such as shirts that say ""former fetus"").

Why the Supreme Court won't rule the Constitution prohibits abortion,"Found [this](https://dilanesper.substack.com/p/no-conservatives-are-not-going-to?fbclid=IwAR3DtLmOgFHbvfhnUWf6YUs97o0KULdNrzhe0PBRW6aHvj_JPEfxhzd1-Ns) interesting article on why concerns about the Courts using the 14th Amendment to ban abortion may be overhyped.   


""The argument that the 14th Amendment imposes a duty on state governments to protect fetuses is not a new argument. It has been kicking around law reviews and ultra-conservative discourse for decades. And yet no Supreme Court justice has adopted it. Not even Justice Thomas, who loves to write “lone wolf” opinions and to take up quixotic causes.

This isn’t because conservatives love the idea that blue states will keep abortion legal even if Roe is overturned. It’s because DeShaney’s holding is integral to any vision of limited government and a restrained regulatory state. Once the Constitution is interpreted to include a duty to protect life, the floodgates will be opened to extend this duty to serve all sorts of liberal goals, and the Supreme Court doesn’t have enough bandwidth to slap down all of them (and it would look absolutely unprincipled and do great damage to the conservative movement and itself if it held that the only life ever needs to be protected is fetal life and only from abortions, not, for instance, pollution).

And there’s a lesson in this. You can’t just pick up a legal argument that gets a bit of chatter and treat it as a serious threat. You actually have to know the subject matter, to know which arguments are attractive to courts and which ones aren’t. In short, you have to talk to experts who know these things. The people who spread this “they’re going to interpret the Constitution to ban all abortions” discourse make the mistake they do because they never actually talk to those experts and ask them about it...""",t2_6panv0t1,1617819296,prochoice
"""Its not the child's fault who its father is or how to was conceived""",Why are people so hell bent on putting women through the maximum possible trauma? I have been fortunate to have never experienced any time of sexual assault or even harassment in my short 19 years of life. But I am in college for psychology and social work and being pro choice and the subjects of rape and sexual harassment have always for some reason been very big subjects for me. I have seen and read about how traumatic sexual assault is and even though I haven't experienced it myself I am a very empathetic person. I despise forcing the hardships of pregnancy and childbirth on any women but in cases of rapes just makes it that much worse. People who have no care about the woman's mental or physical well being appalls me. They don't even care about if the baby is born what the effect of being unwanted has. People don't seem to know that many children are very impacted and hurt by knowing they were not wanted by their biological parents. No not every pregnancy is hard and physically mentally traumatic but some are and that's enough. Pregnancy is very glamorized and people talk about it like there is never the possibility of it going south. Some pregnancies can be pleasant and joyful but others not and no one should be forced to go through that type of physical and mental work especially in cases of rape when they are suffering enough already. I just can't believe the apathy of people when it comes to rape. When I go and get my PhDs and even before it is my passion to work and help those men and women and children who have been victims of domestic and sexual violence.

"Analogy I came up with, also just a rant i guess","I never post anywhere, though today I just had to, I came up with this silly analogy a while ago and I just had to let my thoughts out and share it, let me know what you think.

Sex=Junk food

Pregnancy=Tooth cavity

Abortion=Filling at dentist

I absolutely hate pro-birthers who say that “well maybe she shouldn’t have had sex, she knew the risk”. Well guess fucking what? SEX SHOULDN’T BE A CONSENT TO PREGNANCY! People are gonna have sex regardless. Just like how people are going to eat junk food because it’s simply pleasurable. Does that mean that people who enjoy junk food deserve to have their teeth rot away if they get cavities? No! That’s insane. Insane. That’s what pro-life people sound like.

Anyone who doesn’t want a pregnancy shouldn’t be forced to go through with it. Banning it will only lead to unsafe abortions. Just like how, in an absurd world where dentists could no longer perform fillings, people will still eat junk food because it’s good! It will only lead to unsafe tooth extractions at home, painful, dangerous, not a good idea. To simply put, practice safe sex, eat junk food in moderation lol. But still also keep abortions accessible because accidents still happen, I’ve never been pregnant before but it sounds like hell to be forced to wake up everyday knowing that I can’t do anything about it, if abortion wasn’t accessible where I live. 

One last thing I saw a while ago, if abortion was completely banned for ANY reason, even teen pregnancy included, how is it logical to force that teen have a child she doesn’t want? If you’re under 18 you can’t adopt, simply not able to raise a child because them themselves are children, same thing.

They just don’t understand,"I always see stupid PL posts saying “pro abortion people...” “next time a pro abortion talks to you...” “they’re just pro abortion” and so on. 

That’s not the case though?? 

Being pro-abortion is a completely different thing. All we want is for women to have a goddamn choice. Do they seriously find it that difficult to comprehend? Even though the word “choice” is there? 

It is literally in the name. It’s not something that’s implied. You don’t need to read between the lines. It is literally in your face. **CHOICE.** 

It’s like handing someone a water bottle labelled “water” and they’re trying to convince you it’s shredded paper. Where is their logic? 

Also, do they not understand that having a child is one of the choices?? We’re not running around attacking mothers for not getting abortions. Whereas they will verbally and emotionally abuse people who have had abortions. 

They always say to “yOu knoW YoU caN pUT iT up FOr aDOpTioN, riGHt?¿?” but never take into consideration the fact that they still want to force someone to carry for nine months and endure all the pain the comes with pregnancy and *then* spend hours in unimaginable pain for labour. 

Adoption isn’t a solution for that. You cannot undo childbirth. You can’t undo all the trauma you’ve forced someone through. 

They are so controlled by their feelings. 

Though I dislike the whole PL movement, there are specific people I simply cannot stand because their logic is so flawed. If you’re pro-life you’re pro-life. Simple as. You want there to be no abortions happening. 

If you’re “pro-life with exceptions” you are a massive hypocrite. What, so you hate all babies conceived through rape? You wanna murder those whose parents are related? If it’s incredibly sick you just wanna kill it? You’re basically saying there MUST be trauma involved for a woman to have control over her body. That is fuelling rape culture. You can try to defend yourself all you want, but you are saying that a woman must be in such a bad situation to justify an abortion. 

And those that say even if their baby was extremely unwell they’d still give it a chance to live - you’d seriously put something through so much pain simply because you want to? Do you know how selfish that is?? You genuinely think it’s okay to force something through excruciating pain because you wanna feel like some sort of hero? Says a lot about you. 

When I see the things they say I genuinely end up thinking “am I the braindead idiot? Is there something my mind simply cannot comprehend? Am I missing an important point?” but then remember that no, I simply want living people to have more rights than a bloody corpse. That’s not stupid, *right?* 

And they always assume we want to punish people. No we fucking don’t, Karen. We want a goddamn option to be there. We’re not trying to cause anyone any harm. 

Also they can’t stand when people have their own opinions lmao. God forbid someone has a brain and believes women should have rights!

"Response to ""Abortion is Murder""","This is, in my opinion, the best response to ""abortion is murder."" It keeps the focus on abortion vs murder and rather than just pointing out its incorrect also highlight's why it's simply a bad argument.

**To quote Philosophy Tube: ""Murder is wrong, therefore abortion is wrong. This argument doesn't work. There's a hidden, unstated assumption, abortion is a kind of murder. Murder means wrongful killing. So, this argument is actually assuming that abortion is wrong when that is the very thing that is in contention here.""**

**Basically, assuming abortion is wrong allows you to equate abortion to murder. This begs the question ""Why is abortion wrong?"" This may lead to the response ""Because abortion is murder."" This brings you back to assuming abortion is wrong and equal to murder. It's circular reasoning. It's a logical fallacy.**

This obviously isn't bulletproof as then their argument will turn to, ""it's killing innocents so it's wrong"" ""it's a woman's duty to care and she's neglecting so it's wrong"", but the above argument imo is the best way to counter ""abortion is murder"".

I just went on a bit of a rant...,"
.... in another sub. But it’s probably more appropriate here because I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and I’m quite disgusted with us. It’s almost 50 years after Roe yet here we are. 

I’m old enough to remember when it was a “compromise” to allow abortions in cases of incest and rape. And thinking about how fucked up that is, I’m hoping it doesn’t take us 30 years from now to see how fucked up it is to be forced to be an “organ loaner” and/or be forced to give your life for another. 

———

I’m disgusted with us as a society that in 2021, almost 50 years after Roe v Wade, the first question is still always, “is it ‘alive’?”

Who. 

Gives. 

A. 

Fuck. 

First question: “should we require mandatory organ donations?” We zippidy-do-da past that like it’s not even a factor and people wonder why “pro-life” is seen as “anti-women.” 

Then, the pro-choice side tries to pretend it’s not “alive” when they realize that the anti-choice side really doesn’t GAF about the lives of women, so pro-choicers try another POV.  That’s a philosophical debate which has gone from “the quickening” in 1621 to “heartbeat” in 2021.

This. 

Needs. 

To. 

Stop. 

The sexism and/or misogyny is infuriating. And yes, that includes “pro-life” women. *Forcing women to be pregnant when not wanted is the literal definition of objectification.* In this case, it’s an object to hold another human, as opposed to a human who has that capacity to do so if she chooses. 

The first question must be: “Do we want to force organ donations to save others’ lives?” 

If we as a society decided to do that, then so be it. But right now *we all have more rights over our organs after we are dead, than a woman has over her own uterus, vagina, breasts, brain, heart and every other bodily system effected by pregnancy (ie- every bodily system.)* All to save a life that apparently ~50% of The USA thinks is more important than the person carrying it. 

People believe in this objectification so strongly that they are willing to vote for pedophiles to keep honoring the false God of “human fetus.” And ironically, they think that they’re doing “God’s work.” Newsflash: babies go to heaven, if you believe in that sorta thing, so WIN/WIN! 


How many pro-lifers still have both kidneys? [Because you have not donated one, someone may die.]

How could anyone say with a straight face that sexism is not a factor when they literally choose potential life of fetus &gt; potential life of woman? I don’t even care if it was 2 in a million dead women. That

Pro-lifers total argument is: “you are killing a life.” But we need to back up and decide how everyone is going to be allowed to live that life. Mandatory   organ donation: yay or nay? Right now it’s “nay.” Why should that be any different with female reproductive organs?

Family had on Jesus of Nazareth earlier and as a pro choice Christian I couldn’t help but compare “pro life so called Christians” that think women who get abortions should be put to death to the Pharisees...,"Think about it... the Pharisees wanted to put Jesus to death despite the fact he was innocent only because THEY were offended by his preaching... sound familiar? These pro forced birth nut jobs want to put women who get abortions to death because THEY are offended by others personal choices. Getting an abortion literally doesn’t hurt them or anyone else. Much like Jesus wasn’t hurting anyone by preaching. And pro life so called Christians want to claim is pro choice Christians aren’t true to our faith... the Bible clearly says thou shall not judge. No where does it say thou shall not abort... so who’s really following Christ here? Anyway, I’m not one to push my faith but I don’t know where else to vent as a pro choice Christian.

Pro-lifer is arguing with me that HUMAN LIFE begins at conception...,"Now to keep things short, I, myself, have predominately pro-life views, however for a lot of circumstances I feel and think an abortion should be allowed and is sometimes the only viable option.

But this nincompoop is adamant that human life, like the entirety of what makes us human: breathing, eating, feeling, thinking, sleeping... etc, starts when two cells meet and fertilise?

They’ve thrown a bunch of nonsense, vague ‘medical textbook’ definitions of when human life begins. To sum it up, most of them say something along the lines of “human development begins at conception...” and that I agree with. What is going to eventually become HUMAN starts with an egg meeting a sperm, however, in no world does this mean that that fertilised egg is a human or possesses human life. 

They also went on to say that science says human life begins at conception? Which it does not,  no where in fact. The general consensus is that human life begins at 8 weeks once the foetus has developed, or at 16, when parts of the brain are coming along.

Now at these stages, it does look human, the foetus has a clear head, hands, legs, and is breathing at this stage and actively taking nutrients from its mother.

But there’s no way in my entire life id ever concede to human life beginning when two cells meet, that’s just ridiculous. An unfeeling, non conscious bit of cells isn’t human to me.

50% of these fertilisations end unsuccessful too, so is it also simply ‘evil’ or ‘murder’ if the fertilised egg is unsuccessful and comes out as a period without the mother ever knowing? 

It’s plain stupidity. This person has aggravated me because they’re too far in their own personal beliefs and lies that they think science says human life begins at conception.

I also presented them with the idea that human life beginning is more concerned with philosophy and religion than it is science. Like for example, Jewish believe that it begins at birth, Christians at conception, muslims when the heart forms.. and so on",t2_992nznfj,1617583117,prochoice

Having an abortion is no different than shooting a carjacker or someone breaking in your house,"This is the total hypocrisy of pro lifers.  Many of them will be pro 2A pro self defense yet think it's perfectly okay for the government to take away women's self defense rights.  I'm very pro 2A, I live in Chicago and have to make deliveries for a living.  We've had a massive increase in carjackings this year.  I have a CCW permit and carry a Glock 19 on my right hip at all times.  Carjackers don't care about your life or anything other than taking your hard earned property, and you have every right to defend it, and I have no problem doing so to protect my property, life, family and livelihood.  Having an abortion is not any different than shooting carjackers.  Both are extremely dangerous situations to your life. Pregnancy throughout history has been one of the top killers of women, giving women the absolute right to defend their lives against intruders- fetuses.  Fetuses have killed millions of women throughout history and every year over 300,000 women die due to pregnancy complications.  When it comes to self defense, the law at least in my state lets me stand my ground in my house and shoot home invaders breaking in because every year around 100 homeowners are killed in bulgeries.  The womb is a woman's private property like my house is, and if she feel threatened by a fetus in it, because it is her private property, she has every right to defend it and her self.  Anyone who is pro 2A/ Pro self defense but so called ""pro life"" is a total hypocrite.",t2_7vml04w,1617524487,prochoice

I'm kinda having a crisis...I am going to try to explain this with discretion for this person.,"ok people I want to preface this by saying i have always had prochoice views but i am conflicted atm and I need your advice about how I can get through this. Also this person did not want anyone else to know so I am going to try to use discretion.

Ok so this person i know (35f) recently found out she was pregnant, but its quite complicated. She has a boyfriend ( i say this lightly they somewhat had a falling out but are still friends &amp; do stuff), but she still does stuff w/ other men (including sex). I (14f) told her every time before she would fool around w/them to use protection, but she wasn't concerned because she has different health things which compromise her ability to have children. 

Anyway she found out she was pregnant and did not necessarily know who the father was (it sounds horrible). She told the people that she knew could be the father and the one person that isn't her ""bf"" said ""what are you going to do about it?"", but her ""bf"" was very consoling &amp; helpful (they have had quite a few issues the past with things like this). She wasn't sure who it was, but when she got an ultrasound she knew it wasn't her ""bf""'s she knew it was the other dudes. 

At this point she made her decision ( after a lot of thinking) that she was going to terminate her baby(only 5 weeks). This is mainly because she knew how much it would affect her, her daughter, and she did not want to totally lie to her ""bf"" (he only thought he was the dad bc she did not want to tell him she was  sleeping with other people). She also only wanted to bring the baby into a happy relationship. 

She mainly saw this situation as a sign that she needs to work things out more with her ""bf"", because of how well he reacted &amp; treated her. It also made her realize the good things about this. 

So then finally it reached me ( i am her daughter btw and I was with my dad all week bc of spring break), she wasn't going to tell me but she did. This is because with things that I did in the last year we have grown a lot of communication between each other. I wanted her to tell me the truth, and i already had an idea that she was pregnant. When she told me she was terminating I understood why but i was a little sad. This is because a baby is dying because of my mothers mistake. I was glad that she could have the option though because this is what I fight for ( i am a very active activist for these things), but things hit different when its close to home. I tried not to think about it but I am a lot. Its just weird. I understand the decision but im having trouble dealing with it. 

umm ok i basically need help dealing with this situation.  if ya'll have any questions lmk, sorry for the long post i just needed to explain everything... if your still here thanks for reading it all!

something i keep repeating to myself is

pro lifers hating on antinatalists,"For anyone who doesn't know, antinatalism is essentially the belief that reproducing is immoral because the child you create will suffer (any antinatalists feel free to correct me, all I really know about it is what I've seen on the subreddit). It's a pretty extreme view I guess, but I've looked on the sub a few times out of interest and honestly they bring up some good points, the main one being that they wish people wouldn't just have children for selfish reasons and that it's irresponsible to have a child if you know you aren't going to do your best to provide for it and bring it up well. 

Lately I've seen a bunch of posts on the PL sub shitting on antinatalists. First of all it bothers me that they conflate pro choice and antinatalist. While there are some similarities in the things we talk about, overall they are two separate beliefs. You can be pro choice without being antinatalist, and vice versa. Second, most of the posts they share are literally just antinatalists minding their own business lmao. They keep complaining about how 'depressing' the sub is and it's like, yeah it is a little, but just don't visit the sub if you know it's going to depress you? So many of the anti-antinatalist PL threads aren't even about abortion, they just talk about how depressed they think antinatalists are, saying antinatalists should kill themselves, and saying they're selfish for not wanting children.

Personally, I think PL's apparent hatred for antinatalism reveals the utter obsession so many of them with babies, and wanting everyone to have as many babies as possible. They violently reject anybody who says 'hey, maybe having babies isn't always a good thing'. One of the recent posts even calls birthing babies 'bringing the gift of human life to the world'. They all sound so weird honestly, like they're in some kind of baby worshipping cult. They so often say things like 'we don't care if you don't conceive children, just don't kill them' but it's pretty obvious many of them DO care which is why they're so pissed at antinatalism which isn't even inherently about abortion.",t2_7vjuchsg,1617472527,prochoice
Can I just say how much I actually dislike the entirety of the song Rockabye because of one line in it that turns the whole thing sour?,"I hate that they justify this single mother's everyday hardship and struggle with the line, ""she chose to **use her heart and keep him**.""

I dislike the implication that by choosing to complete an unplanned pregnancy at a difficult time as a single mother, she was choosing to use her heart because the direct implication here is that abortion, or even placing for adoption if you really think about it, is somehow heartless.

I was just hearing this song playing at Wawa and heard that line and was reminded of how much I always hated it.  I didn't get an abortion because I ""wasn't using my heart.""

Like why take what could have just been an uplifting story about a single mom making it for her son, and turn it into a back-handed dig at those who choose abortion?

Forced-birth groups are trying to get someone fired from her job. They’re actually contacting her employer because she also works at Planned Parenthood.,"According to birthers, an employee at St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, WA (doesn’t give the hospital address but you can find it with a Google search) is also an abortion doctor, which they discovered at their “prayer vigils.” So they called St. Joseph’s basically demanding that she be fired.

This isn’t just anti-choicers on the internet. This is actual anti-abortion groups like Students for Life, and the activist Kristan Hawkins. People who attempt to maintain a compassionate image for PR. They’re posting where this woman works and telling followers to mob the hospital’s HR.

Basically, women have been oppressed so much in our culture that controlling their bodies the way prolifers do isn’t even seen as misogynistic by much of society. Instead it’s seen as “normal,” like how women being most assault victims is “normal.” If our culture wouldn’t have systemic misogyny then prolife would rightfully be recognized as a predatory, misogynistic movement that systemically hurts and controls women.",t2_9lx2pvx6,1617280093,prochoice
How to choose the best standing desk for your home office? Here is Pro's tip,"More and more companies are using standing desks. They’re ditching office chairs in favor of a healthier alternative. These desks come in several types. It can be innovative with electric motors.

Some brands kept in basic motions there are standing desks that are manually adjusted. And lastly, some brands allow you to use your old desk along with a standing desk converter. And these desks would serve you well in your home office to

First, if you want to choose a great standing desk, you should define which is gold standard of a standing desk

[What’s the gold standard for standing desks](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Whats_the_gold_standard_for_standing_desks)?

With a lot of [reviews for standing desk](https://standingdesktopper.com/standing-desk/products-review/) brands, how do you know which one is credible? Some may review a brand since they’re getting something out of it aka sponsored. So you can expect nothing but good stuff. All the cons may be shaded.

And reviews of first-time users are genuine. But if it is their first standing desk, there’s a limitation there. They would not be able to compare it to other brands.

So can you still expect these reviews to give you the gold standard for standing desks? And is there such a thing as a gold standard for standing desks? And how can you say which brand is the best? 

Your cup of tea

The thing is, the gold standard for best standing desks is subjective. Some brands may indeed be hyped up. So with a lot of marketing and advertising, these brands may be quickly held up on a pedestal. So everyone may come in line to buy what the internet perceives as “ the best.” 

Or since it’s quite popular, they become the go-to desk of most users. A lot of users may have a good experience with the desk. Thus, everyone hopes to get the same experience.

In reality, your neighbor’s gold standard for a best standing desk might be different from yours. If person A has an elaborate workstation, his gold standard for standing desks will have to be the carrying capacity and larger desk area.

If you’re more into aesthetics, your gold standard might be a luxurious tabletop with curved edges and wood grain finish. 

So it all depends on your preferences and needs. 

One person may perceive an Autonomous standing desk as the overall best according to his experience. But you may find it lacking. And you may opt for a Steelcase standing desk instead. After all, the premium price definitely means higher quality right?

But that’s not really the case. A higher price does not automatically mean that a best standing desk can serve all your needs. Even a cheaper brand can be your best overall if it ticks all the stuff on your list. So branding a standing desk as the best overall is overrated. And it can be misleading too for most.

* [Does this mean that the best overall tag doesn’t have any bearing?](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Does_this_mean_that_the_best_overall_tag_doesnt_have_any_bearing)

Not necessarily. A best standing desk may become popular for two reasons. One, it’s just hyped up due to intense and strategic advertising and marketing. And two, people have positive experiences from using the desk. 

But it isn’t one size fits all, it has to meet your needs and wants in a desk. Some brands may fulfill the needs of the majority, hence the popularity. But you cannot say the same for unless you have tried the desk yourself. 

* [Return policy period](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Return_policy_period)  

   * [One year](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#One_year)

   * [Which is better, a one year return period or 6 months?](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Which_is_better_a_one_year_return_period_or_6_months)
* [Customer service](https://standingdesktopper.com/best-standing-desks/#Customer_service)

Another factor that most users are now considering as part of the gold standard in standing desks is the customer service of the brand. 

Buying a desk is just the start of your relationship with the brand. Should you have any problems, you would want the manufacturer to be able to address them asap. And that’s when you get the most value of your money. If your manufacturer is ghosting you, you won’t be able to fix the problem. Hence, you won’t be able to use the desk. So that’s going to be money down the drain.

For instance, some users complain about Autonomous taking so long to return the calls for a refund request. Some brands would take a month before they would be able to answer a single query or question. And other manufacturers don’t even do after-sales anymore. 

Aftersale is important because brands can get recommendations for good customer service. And you’d likely get a second desk or product from them should you be assisted properly right?

Among the bands, several manufacturers can stand out in terms of customer service. Steelcase, a premium brand, is known for its excellent customer service. 

You can get answers to your queries asap. So you’d instantly feel that the brand will be there for you even if you have already purchased an item. And should you have any problem with your desk in the future, the solution is just one phone call away. 

Fully also has great customer service. They’ll process your refund or replacement right away. And If you mistakenly ordered the wrong size, the brand can cover the shipping expenses and they can even pick up the desk. Though this may vary for some locations, this is what I have experienced. And I didn’t have to print the return label. It’s like being spoon-fed haha.

The gold standard for standing desks should satisfy your individual needs and requirements. That’s why not one size fits all. Also, it helps to do a lot of research. Albeit many sponsored reviews, there are still unbiased and objective reviews on the internet. You just have to do comprehensive research. 

And it’s best to buy from brands that have a sufficient return policy period. Because at the end of the day, you should get the best value from your money. That’s the gold standard.

Ok, hope you guys get it. Let’s start with the list in 2021

Pro-life propaganda is brainwashing me and ruining my sex life,"I don’t know where to talk about this 

I’m (20F) and I am in a serious relationship and have been for 6 months (serious for less than 4). We had only had sex once and that was the first and last time I have ever had sex and it was over 3 months ago. It gave me so much anxiety. I am on the pill and we used a condom. But I was still freaking out being pregnant because I had skipped my placebo pills so I didn’t know when a “period” was gonna come. And my periods were irregular and I had “pregnancy symptoms”. 

Anxiety got worse when I started to get loose stools (sorry TMI) thinking it was going to affect the pill because I take it perfectly and lose sleep over it. I see a therapist and she says that it’s just anxiety. I even went to the doctor to consider an alternative, but she didn’t recommend them because of my current anxiety/depression and my weight gain (that’s unrelated from the pill). 

The thing is I’m not afraid of sex, nor pregnancy, I became afraid of abortions. I was always pro choice growing up. But after watching some propaganda (think Kaitlin Bennett, those pro life people who hold those signs at the abortion clinics, and teen moms or women who almost had an abortion but changed their mind) I feel brainwashed. They’d always say things regarding taking responsibility for what you do and that imply that you are a bad person. 

I’m so scared to have sex now. Thinking if I should remain abstinent. It’s ruined my mental health. He doesn’t seem to mind but I know it’s gonna affect our relationship later on. I’m even scared of having sex during my placebo pills. Because there’s always the risk of me getting pregnant and I KNOW that terminating is my option at this moment because I am not ready financially to have a baby (another argument pro-lifers say is that you can never be ready to have a child). I feel traumatised thinking about walking in one of those clinics with those people with the signs telling me to go to hell.

Can a pregnant person sign away their parental right, ending the connection, thus making the discussion should a person have to give their body to another person, not “their child”.

Is there a better way to word my stance on abortion that people understand?,"I want to explain my stance and then try to explain the problems I’m running into, so bear with me! 

I am ultimately pro-choice. I believe a woman has the right to choose what’s best for her body. I believe it’s no one else’s business but her own. I am also a Christian. For me, that means I would never get an abortion myself. I am against it when it comes to my body. Again, it’s a woman’s own choice to make. I think Christians need to stop judging women because it’s not our right as human beings to judge one another. 

I try to explain my stance to others when asked, and I often get verbally attacked saying I can’t support women when part of my is still pro life (even though the small part is amongst myself). I know overall Christians are seen as judgemental or “holier than thou” and I’m extremely against that type of Christianity. I’m wondering if most people automatically put up a wall when they realize they’re talking to someone with Christian beliefs, and that may be the issue I’m running into. How can I explain my views in a better way that help people understand? I hate being tied in with the rest of the pro life side of things, because I truly am against how they treat human beings.

We argue for the lives of the fetus, but do we consider after they are born? It’s important to remember, that baby will be exposed to some dark parts of humanity before it’s even 13. They will deal with climate change, sexism, racism, homophobia, and everything else that children should not be subjected to. The fetus doesn’t have that misfortune. They live comfortably in the uterus until they are either born, miscarried, or aborted. A fetus doesn’t know what they will be subjected to when they are born, and so why do we advocate for them to be born into a world full of hatred. I’m not very old yet, and I was born into the housing market crash, global financial issues, climate issues, among other things. My great grandmother was born during the Great Depression.

How do you perceive pro-life people?,"Hi everyone, 

I am interested in having your feedback on how you perceive pro-life people. Let me explain. I became pro-life a few years ago and since then, my views haven't stopped evolving. At first, I was shocked at what I didn't know in terms of human development, so I was highly focused on that. But the more I go, and the more I realize how much I am passionate about helping women, and I truly believe that everyone has equal value. So when we say that an embryo has the same value has a grown-up woman, it goes the other way too. I do think that some pro-life people seem to not highlight this point enough, though.

So now that you have a bit more context, how do you see pro-lifers? Do you think it's possible that some (or even the majority) of them also want the best for women? And if so, what could they do to show it more? Is there any way, or any services that could bring us all to a mutual understanding and toward working together?",t2_5l11fk7x,1617077666,prochoice

\-Any variation of 'she put the baby there', 'she forced it to be dependent on her', often accompanied by an analogy that compares pregnancy to kidnapping

\-Saying the woman should have used birth control, not realising it isn't 100% effective

\-Claiming that pregnancy and childbirth are just an inconvenience and don't harm women in any way

\-Not knowing that a large number of fertilised eggs never implant in the uterus and become a pregnancy

\-Not knowing that IVF clinics discard the embyros they don't use

\-Saying that abortion is 'murdering a baby' and arguing that any abortion they deem morally acceptable, such as the removal of an ectopic pregnancy 'isn't actually an abortion' 

\-Saying that embyros/fetuses 'scream in pain' and 'feel afraid' during abortions

Does this analogy/explanation about an uncommon use of empathy (6th definition of empathy by Psychologist Daniel Batson) make sense?,"Daniel Batson's 6th definition of empathy is ""Imagining how one would think and feel in the other's place."" [It can be read about in depth on pages 18 and 19 of Batson's' ""Altruism in Humans.""](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=b4fJWzJRnPkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;ots=dNPANVT6wI&amp;sig=w9Vfa3fOx8Ui_9Y2v5YMcBUVkXU#v=onepage&amp;q=define&amp;f=false) but hopefully this post suffices.

Fetuses do not feel anything, and you wouldn't feel anything if you were a fetus. You also wouldn't know you exist.

This analogy may help demonstrate how one can still be empathetic according to psyschologist Daniel Batson. After presenting the analogy, I will compare it to a situation with a fetus.

Imagine if you had a color blind friend standing five feet to your left, and you wanted to look ""from their perspective."" It could mean standing five feet to the left and seeing everything in a color blind way (the perspective of). It could also mean standing five feet to the left and seeing as you normally see (what you see from that perspective).

So here, let's say ""the perspective of"" the fetus is like seeing things from that position in a world while color blind while ""what you see from that perspective"" is seeing things from that position while seeing as you normally see.

Just like you can garner how it feels to see from the position of the color blind person in two different ways, you can see from the position of the fetus in two different ways. Naturally, ""the perspective of"" is blank because the fetus (during most abortions) has no perspective itself. But ""what you see from that perspective"" is vivid, real, and meaningful. It also is not a projection onto the fetus any more than your standing five feet to your left to see what you see from the perspective of your color blind friend is a projection onto your color blind friend.

So when a prolifer puts themselves into the perspective of the fetus, to see what they can see from that perspective, they are not projecting, and they are empathizing in a real and meaningful way.

That is what Daniel Batson's 6th definition of empathy is about. Not projection. Not nothingness. A real and meaningful feeling garnered from placing oneself in the position, perspective of the fetus. With this understanding, a prolifers actions may be driven in an altruistic direction.",t2_gj0l2,1617027082,prochoice

Pro Life and Misogyny?,"Is it me or do pro lifers have a tendency of seeing women as objects?

I think women have every right to control their bodies yet pro lifers want to take that basic human right away. They seem to portray women as objects and gaslight them even when their pregnancy is the result of an assault, which is downright sick. Also anyone else notice that pro life communities are grossly against other basic human rights like LGBT rights and are openly racist? Some seriously sick people in the pro life community in my opinion-even though I have extremely low expectations for pro lifers, just as I do with racists, homophobes and transphobes, and “men’s rights activists,” all of those various hateful groups continue to shock me with their race to become the worst of the worst. In their circlejerks of hate they make a race to go to the bottom of the barrel. For example, racists not only deny the systemic racism that groups like African and Asian Americans routinely face but in their echo chambers they believe increasingly ridiculous things like “white genocide.” 

Pro lifers, in their circlejerks of misogyny increasingly view women as being objects, as their circlejerks create an increasing radicalization issue. It’s almost like a race for pro lifers to become as hateful and misogynistic as possible.

Religion Needs To F Off Real Quick,"I'm generally against religion in this time and age but accept its existence and its followers. What I don't accept and tolerate is it being involved in politics or real problems in general.

YouTube recommended me [this video](https://youtu.be/e2mYim4oPnk), of Pro-choice activists in Argentina celebrating after lawmakers approved a bill that could lead to the legalisation of abortion, under which people commented on how bad that is and that its against god and retarded shit like that.

Small rant about religion (not as important):

&gt;!I can't understand how religion is still a thing in todays modern society led by science and facts. Religion was created because humans needed a reason on why certain things behaved like they did. Thunder and shit was a sign that god was butt-hurt about something but now we know its related to some electrodynamic phenomena (I don't know as much about it to be able to explain it in detail) But now that science is actually describing (almost) everything we should get rid of religion because other than being a brake to humanity's evolution and development its useless.!&lt;

What I'm saying is that I think it's unacceptable that religion is regarded when making political decisions concerning abortion laws and the right of a woman to be able to decide what's good for her and what is not. 

Now I'm no woman nor a feminist but abortion is a topic one shouldn't be able to debate on: A foetus is not a person, the woman can decide over her own body, god doesn't exist and some ideology from an ancient useless book has no right to be involved in such decisions, and that's it.

I heard an argument against Pro Choice and I want to know your take on it because I cannot rebut it.,"I'm a 20 year old female and I've always been pro-choice. I thought that's a violinist argument was very compelling for pro choice. (Basicly, if your heart is hooked up to a nother person, if you separate yourself, which will cause the other person to die. Is this moral?) 

I heard another argument for pro life and it goes like this: if you force somebody to be dependent on you, then take that away, that is murder. For example, if you dangle someone off the edge of the cliff, you're forcing them to be dependent on you. If you then let go of them, they die. A better example, if you and your friend are mountain climbing and you know that there's a risk of that one of you may get seriously hurt(risk of pregnancy/sex), you two made a contract that if somebody gets hurt, they can rely on your bodily autonomy to keep them alive(getting pregnant) so, since that contract is made and your buddy is hurt and needs to be hooked up to your circulatory system, if you unplug yourself from him(abortion) that is murder because you did something where you knew there was a risk where your friend would have been dependent on you.

PL: Shut down Planned Parenthood across the country!!

Me: Why?

PL: Because they don’t care about the women! They are in it for the money!

Me: Have you been watching nothing but Unplanned for hours straight?

PL: So? It’s a true story! 

Me: You do realize they clearly have outward bias to Planned Parenthood they deliberately leave out certain parts?

PL: So what? It’s racist!

Me: Them establishing clinics to have those who are low income who just so happen to be people of color doesn’t seem racist to me.

PL: They didn’t let a black person through!

Me: Okay can you show me an article?

PL: There’s no article, I saw it on Facebook! How brave of them to bring out their testimony!

Me: You do know that can easily be a lie right? Considering how much y’all hate PP then it’s insanely likely it’s a made up story to add on to get more people to hate on them.

PL: People don’t lie! It’s a sin!

Me: Didn’t stop the director from making Unplanned though

PL: *officially triggered* You have NO right to say this! We are doing people a service ridding them of this place!

Me: So you are against trans people getting service?

PL: What?

Me: Planned Parenthood is known for its articles on queer identities and support for LGBTQ+ people, it’s also well known they do other forms of care and not just abortions.

PL:They still do abortions though!

Me: So? Why shut down an entire establishment when you can easily ban the abortion part of it all?

PL: They won’t give up easily though! These selfish people want to suck women’s wallet dry!

Me: Yeah you are all literally saying you want their entire establishment gone off the face of the Earth... I would be pissed if I was the owner.

PL: We are saving lives!

Me: You sound more selfish than anything?

PL: No, I’m *selfless*

Me: Selfish actually

PL: How?

Me: Considering you rather do nothing by law and rather shut down an establishment as a whole, you are disregarding their support for LGBT+ youth, other forms of care besides abortion, sex education, and also its education on sexual assault and rape. Planned Parenthood is not only providing abortion but also help teach better and safer sex to avoid accidental pregnancies. If Planned Parenthood was the “selfish” one then why are they providing methods to safer sex and teaching about consent? Wouldn’t that make abortions happen less often? Wouldn’t that mean..idk... that they care more about the customer rather than the money?

PL: ......

Me: ....?

PL: ITS STILL MURDER!

Me: *facepalm*

Pro-control


Why?

God being the apparent solution to every rape culture dilemma and shoving that shit downs people throat acting like your religion is the most correct thing in the universe.

Victim blaming, need I say more on this point?

Emotionally manipulating the person to keep the child, i.e. “You are murdering a child” “murderer”, “They are the future for society”, “they could be the one to help society better itself, why take that away”

(Connects with the last point but still) Acting like the fetus is some holy prodigy.

Using your own experience and expect it to be the same for the rest.

Slut-shaming, do I really have to explain why that can be controlling?



I’m sick and tired of hearing that they are “helping” when in reality it’s just for their own gain, it’s just to feed their ego of “giving life” and it’s disgusting how they silence the person who went through a possibly traumatic event and not say about THEIR womb , and THEIR body.

an argument ive seen alot,"alot of arguments i’ve seen from black conservatives is that you can’t be pro choice and pro black so I’m going to delve into the context behind the pro life movement in america. 

before the abolishment of slavery, abortion was legal until the “quickening” which was when a fetus started moving, and if an abortion was preformed afterwards it was a misdemeanor with reasoning usually being mothers safety.

a majority of the people who preformed abortions at this time were indigenous or black women. they had superior herbal knowledge over male doctors who would do invasive hurtful practices that were sometimes fatal. not to mention tools for abortion were invented on minority womens backs.

after the abolishment of slavery, the doctors felt threatened by these women because they were competition and started making racist and misogynistic smear campaigns against them. 

this is the western development of the pro life movement.

and on the topic that most PP’s are in low income areas, 60% of PP’s are in predominantly white areas? 

the idea that PP is racist just isn’t factually correct by any means. except the mainly smear campaigns discrediting Sanger (who was definitely a eugenist).

- Everyone has the same exposure to sexual education. (In third world countries, most people don’t even know how to read and write).

- Every birth control method is 100% effective. 

- All soon-to-be adopted kids will live a blissful life with a rich family. And there is a 100% adoption rate.

I'm pro-choice due to my mother even though she is firmly anti (NSFW-ish),"Details are a bit fuzzy.

I am the younger of two children. When my mom was pregnant with my brother, he stretched her uterus (again, a bit fuzzy), at least more than other mothers are stretched. When she was pregnant with me, I just made that way worse. Two kids were enough for her mentally, so she got her tubes tied some time after I was born. She later heard from a doctor that she made a good choice, because two kids were also enough physically. 

Later on I thought about it more. What if another woman had the same problem, but she didn't get her tubes tied and then she got pregnant again? How bad would it be? And I and presumably my brother were both C-sections. What if this hypothetical woman gave birth naturally? Would that make it worse? Would her or her baby even survive delivery?

'consequence-free sex',"It always makes me laugh when the 'babies are a blessing', 'miracle of childbirth' crowd turns around and comes up with phrases like 'consequence free sex' to demean people who use birth control. Their cause is supposed to be about 'protecting innocent babies' yet they have no problem admitting that they basically see babies as a punishment to their parents for daring to enjoy sexual intercourse. It ties into how they always insist that the fetus is 'innocent' as opposed to the dirty, dirty whore who committed the sin of consenting to sex without the desire to become a mother. 

It honestly makes me sad for them. When they say shit like that it just makes me think they probably have heavily internalised bitterness over the fact that they were raised in a culture that forbids BC and premarital sex, and that they probably secretly think of their own babies as just a 'consequence' for having sex as a fertile woman.

"""Consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy"" -My debate with a pro-lifer, what did I do wrong?","I was debating with a pro-lifer, and my argument was, ""consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy.""

I used the analogy, ""consent to crossing the street is not consent to getting hit by a car.""

My point, and I made it clear to him, that we cannot control external factors. Consent to one thing is not consent to another. You can consent to crossing the street but you cant consent to getting hit by a car, because you cannot control the car.

Just like you cannot control the external factors that is fertilization. Is this a clear argument, like, does it make sense?

Because he then went on to say that, ""consent to sex IS consent to pregnancy."" He argued that you can control fertilization, and/or getting someone pregnant. Which is absenting from sex. 

I rebutted that, and said, ""if consent to sex is consent to pregnancy than infertility wouldn't be a problem."" 

He even agreed with my other point, ""woman can get pregnant by rape, even if they don't consent to sex."" 

I cannot understand why he agreed when I used rape to demonstrate my argument, but everything else went over his head. 

Or maybe there is something I did wrong? Did I not make it clear enough or are there better ways to go about this argument? Haven't I demonstrated that consent to sex is NOT consent to pregnancy? 

Or maybe he is the one at fault? 

He also said my analogy for, ""consent to crossing the street is not consent to getting hit by a car."" Is wrong.  Because, ""getting hit by a car is a result to crossing the street."" So now he is arguing risks. 

So I rebutted that, ""Consent to sex is consent to the risks of an abortion. Your genetic material is now out of your control, what a woman does with it is her choice."" Or is that not a good rebuttal?

Step Into My Gilded Cage,"I got this response recently. I'm sure it's connected with the Men's Rights movement:

""my problem is the mother has the right to kill the child, and im pretty  sure she doesn't require the father's permission. she has all the  power, all the control. so i'm going to put the bulk of the  responsibility on the one with the entirety of the power. yes, the man  should be required to assist with finances, but by the same token the  woman should be required to at least have the child, and if were going  to have laws in place relieving her of that responsibility, then the man  should be able to choose whether he wants to support it or not. i don't ""want"" a child, but if i have sex and she becomes pregnant, i'm damn sure going to be supporting it, even if i can't be there for it  physically""

I refer to this as the Gilded Cage argument. Although it may not seem like it, I believe this person is anti-abortion. You wouldn't actually know it by his comments, here, but previous comments point to that. Furthermore, this person isn't really against child support. He seems to be aggrieved by it.

Assumptions this argument asks you to make:

* Women have all the power. How irksome!
* Men are responsible.
* Men have no way of avoiding being identified as the father.
* Men have no way of avoiding paying child support.
* Forcing women to endure the physical torture of carrying a fetus, enduring labor and birth, recovery, and caring for the child afterward are the same as the financial debt of child support payments.

If you look closely when this argument is brought up, you would think that this person is bringing up a grievance with the responsibility he faces. He isn't. He is an anti-abortionist. He is saying that it's a shitty situation and the least the woman can do is have the child. He is basically trying to get you to admit that he is trapped and he's fine with that, but women should be to. Step into this gilded cage.

If he was truly aggrieved, he would be pro-choice. Access to abortion would see less men paying child support. So, his grievance is false in this regard.

His problem isn't that women are having abortions. His problem is that women are choosing to have kids when men don't want them to. His argument garbles this fact. His problem is with the fact that women have a choice.

In fact, when I mentioned that removing access to abortion would require a larger system of making men responsible, making them submit to paternity tests, and more strict child support, he was fine with that.

This person isn't saying the system is unfair. He's welcoming you into a system. He's showing you the structure that you should submit to. Isn't it a nice cage where you are safely cared for because there is no possible way men can get out of child support if they choose to have sex with a woman.

Additionally, the argument asks you to accept that a woman's excruciating suffering in childbirth is the same as financial obligations. Here's the thing, I'm pretty sure we don't put men in debtors prisons for not paying child support. We don't remove their freedoms. Financial debt and financial obligations are in no way equal to the torture you are forcing women into during labor, birth, and recovery. One is torture. The other is debt. Those two are not comparable.

Finally, this person is trying to say the system is unjust. The injustice that affects him means that some other group of people should also suffer. That's not how justice works. He should demand reform of the system he's sees as unjust. He doesn't want to. He believes that the system he sees as unjust against his favor helps his argument to force women into birth. What he should really be focusing on is reforming the laws that affect him. Removing someone else's freedom and choice, doesn't help him in the least.",t2_65x13yco,1615489110,prochoice

Like, ""it could cure cancer"" yes, but it can become an equivalent to Hitler.
When a women's (mental) health is endangered by carrying out the baby, you're risking a (the women's) life just for your pro lifer thought of saving a baby, which isn't even ensured to live.
If a women really wants to abort but isn't allowed to, the living child will suffer under that.

An aborted child is better than an unloved child, which will kill themselves eventually.

 Many pro lifers view isn't long term thinking and causing problems in many cases.

If you think, that a 3 month old is a full human, you have every right to do so. But then don't abort. 

Leave people their own choices. Let's fight all (pro choices and pro lifers) together to legalise abortion worldwide. Only with the needed psychological help, a women has the possibility to know all aspects of abortion and of giving the birth. That way she can decide much better.

Questions:

Mentions of child sexual abuse and pedophilia warning

1. Should it be illegal to write about dark, disturbing, illegal, or taboo subjects? An example of content many pro-censorship people object to would be a book/novel detailing an inappropriate/abusive relationship between a young child and an adult (CSA and pedophilia).

2. Should it be illegal to search for, view, or possess animated/cartoon/computer-generated images involving violence/obscenity/illegal acts? Another example that many object to is loli/shotacon. Extremely important note: I’m not talking about editing a child’s face onto an image or deep fakes. I’m talking about animated or cartoon images of fictional or drawn or animated.

Random question: If someone is an adult (18+) but they still feel like they’re a young or younger child (like 10-14) but they’ve only ever been attracted to grown men (18 to 21+), is that person a pedophile?

A George Carlin classic.,"Why, why, why, why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to fuck in the first place, huh? Boy, these conservatives are really something, aren't they? They're all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don't want to know about you. They don't want to hear from you. No nothing. No neonatal care, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool, you're fucked.

Conservatives don't give a shit about you until you reach ""military age"". Then they think you are just fine. Just what they've been looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. Pro-life... pro-life... These people aren't pro-life, they're killing doctors! What kind of pro-life is that? What, they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it. They're not pro-life. You know what they are? They're anti-woman. Simple as it gets, anti-woman. They don't like them. They don't like women. They believe a woman's primary role is to function as a brood mare for the state.

Pro-life... You don't see many of these white anti-abortion women volunteering to have any black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses, do you? No, you don't see them adopting a whole lot of crack babies, do you? No, that might be something Christ would do. And, you won't see a lot of these pro-life people dousing themselves in kerosene and lighting themselves on fire. You know, morally committed religious people in South Vietnam knew how to stage a goddamn demonstration, didn't they?! They knew how to put on a fucking protest. Light yourself on FIRE!! C'mon, you moral crusaders, let's see a little smoke. To match that fire in your belly.

Here's another question I have: how come when it's us, it's an abortion, and when it's a chicken, it's an omelette? Are we so much better than chickens all of a sudden? When did this happen, that we passed chickens in goodness? Name six ways we're better than chickens... See, nobody can do it! You know why? 'Cuz chickens are decent people. You don't see chickens hanging around in drug gangs, do you? No, you don't see a chicken strapping some guy to a chair and hooking up his nuts to a car battery, do you? When's the last chicken you heard about came home from work and beat the shit out of his hen, huh? Doesn't happen. 'Cuz chickens are decent people.

But let's get back to this abortion shit. Now, is a fetus a human being? This seems to be the central question. Well, if a fetus is a human being, how come the census doesn't count them? If a fetus is a human being, how come when there's a miscarriage they don't have a funeral? If a fetus is a human being, how come people say ""we have two children and one on the way"" instead of saying ""we have three children?"" People say life begins at conception, I say life began about a billion years ago and it's a continuous process. Continuous, just keeps rolling along. Rolling, rolling, rolling along.

And say you know something? Listen, you can go back further than that. What about the carbon atoms? Hah? Human life could not exist without carbon. So is it just possible that maybe we shouldn't be burning all this coal? Just looking for a little consistency here in these anti-abortion arguments. See the really hardcore people will tell you life begins at fertilization. Fertilization, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. Which is usually a few moments after the man says ""Gee, honey, I was going to pull out but the phone rang and it startled me."" Fertilization.

But even after the egg is fertilized, it's still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins, and not every egg makes it that far. Eighty percent of a woman's fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has. They wind up on sanitary napkins, and yet they are fertilized eggs. So basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who's had more than more than one period is a serial killer! Consistency. Consistency. Hey, hey, if they really want to get serious, what about all the sperm that are wasted when the state executes a condemned man, one of these pro-life guys who's watching cums in his pants, huh? Here's a guy standing over there with his jockey shorts full of little Vinnies and Debbies, and nobody's saying a word to the guy. Not every ejaculation deserves a name.

Now, speaking of consistency, Catholics, which I was until I reached the age of reason, Catholics and other Christians are against abortions, and they're against homosexuals. Well who has less abortions than homosexuals?! Leave these fucking people alone, for Christ sake! Here is an entire class of people guaranteed never to have an abortion! And the Catholics and Christians are just tossing them aside! You'd think they'd make natural allies. Go look for consistency in religion. And speaking of my friends the Catholics, when John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and some of these other Cardinals and Bishops have experienced their first pregnancies and their first labor pains and they've raised a couple of children on minimum wage, then I'll be glad to hear what they have to say about abortion. I'm sure it'll be interesting. Enlightening, too. But, in the meantime what they ought to be doing is telling these priests who took a vow of chastity to keep their hands off the altar boys! Keep your hands to yourself, Father! You know? When Jesus said ""Suffer the little children come unto me"", that's not what he was talking about!

So you know what I tell these anti-abortion people? I say ""Hey. Hey. If you think a fetus is more important that a woman, try getting a fetus to wash the shit stains out of your underwear. For no pay and no pension."" I tell them ""Think of an abortion as term limits. That's all it is. Biological term limits.

Do you see any boundaries for bodily autonomy when it comes to abortion?,"First, let me preface, that my knowledge about reproductive science is pretty low, so this post might actually be moot.

Anyway, I have no moral reservations about ending pregnancy when the fetus is unviable and can't feel pain, as well as even when the fetus becomes viable baby. But when fetus becomes viable and the woman decides to end her pregnancy, it should be up to her, but at that point, her doctor should prioritize baby's autonomy and right to life. So if the baby is viable, but still before pregnancy is due, the woman has the right for premature birth.

I believe that first 4-4.5 months are totally OK, when the fetus is nonviable and can't feel pain. But what if there is some short time when fetus is nonviable, but can already feel pain, which makes me question wheter I should consider myself bodily autonomy absolutist.

How do you guys feel about sites using 'baby' when explaining fetal development?,"In my opinion it's just at the least, confusing. At worse, very shitty. 

I was looking into fetal development websites for my scientific curiosity, but then when they use 'baby' I got confused. ""Do they mean when the baby is born these developmental processes continue?"" Read on and realized it was still talking about the fetus. 

Yes, if you are pregnant and excited, I get you'll say 'baby', but this is supposed to be a scientific question. Also, calling it fetus doesn't take away how the speaker feels about it. You being pregnant willingly and wanting to carry it to term, you can still say 'the fetus will develop limbs at 4 weeks' or whatever.

Title: **Can anyone help me understand how a doctor can abort a 2nd or 3rd Trimester baby that is perfectly healthy?**

&gt; Obviously I’m disgusted by the women who post on the abortion subreddit about wanting to abort so late into their pregnancy. They may have found out late or their boyfriend cheated or  whatever their reason is to do something so selfish (yes I said selfish even though I may not use that word for a woman in the first tri)However, we gotta realize that these women wouldn’t follow through with an abortion if it wasn’t for the doctors who are willing to perform them. 

&gt; You know a lot of these doctors also perform later abortions on women who have WANTED pregnancies that desperately want a healthy baby. Often there is a severe issue which make them choose to the end the pregnancy. And then this same doctor is willing to kill a healthy baby next Tuesday because the mom was in denial about being pregnant? I’m sorry this is repugnant. Let me also say that there are plenty of pro choice doctors who perform abortions themselves who would never think of doing what these late term doctors do. 

&gt; The doctors who perform these late term abortions on perfectly healthy fetuses have something in their brains and hearts that most of us are missing thank God. The fact that most of society overwhelmingly would never think to do what you are doing for a living should lead you to do some deep introspection. I try to refrain from judging others without walking in their shoes but if I came face to face with a 2nd and 3rd abortion provider I wouldn’t hesitate to let them know that I wholeheartedly feel they are doing the Devil’s work.",t2_1uitsl44,1614416902,prochoice

Am I pro-choice?,"First off, I want to make it clear that I hate all of those anti-choice/anti-abortion people who fetishize a fetus but don’t give a fuck about it the moment it comes into the world and becomes an actual, born child/person. That annoys/angers me.

I also want to say that I support safe, legal, and accessible abortion and have tried to educate myself on this issue, considering I’m AFAB and somewhat to very liberal/democratic (although I’m against censorship and not anti-gun).

I fully support safe, legal, and accessible abortion, but I become more and more uncomfortable with it the later in a pregnancy.

The earliest point I become uncomfortable with it is about 14 weeks - the earliest point when a fetus may/could experience some pain. Here’s my source: https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/1/3

Luckily, 91.1% of all abortions performed in the United States in 2018 (according to the CDC) were performed before 14 weeks.

I become much more uncomfortable at about 17 to 20 weeks for multiple reasons. For one thing, almost all abortion procedures performed at 17 to 20 weeks (in the U.S. at least) are surgical. The procedure involves dismembering and decapitating the fetus - the doctor uses forceps to tear it into pieces to remove it. The fetus may or may not be alive during - it depends on whether it died before the procedure (either from a miscarriage/fetal death or from an injection to cause fetal death). But either way, it’s torn apart.

I saw a video of this procedure that appears to be real - I’d guess it’s about 18 to 20 weeks, and it looks a bit cruel, especially if that fetus was alive and/or could feel pain.

I’m most uncomfortable with late second and third trimester abortions. I know abortions after 20 weeks are 1% of abortions. But that’s 1% of abortions performed on fetuses that have a chance of survival.

Multiple babies born between 21 weeks and 0 days and 21 weeks and 6 days have survived - with minimal complications.

Apart from a handful of freelance blogs and one reputable news source located in Austin, Texas, another in Dallas, and one in Houston, TST has not received coverage for the announcement. While it is presumptuous to say that the media must cover all of TST's legal actions, this lawsuit will have profound ramifications for religious liberty and abortion rights. Given that TST received extensive media coverage for many previous announcements, the absence of coverage for the new lawsuit is conspicuous. 

The blackout suggests a lack of integrity by the media whose discomfort with the subject matter inhibits their capacity to report on a major story. Conservative publications do not want to report on the lawsuit because they would have to reconcile TST’s legitimate claim to religious liberty. Liberal publications are apprehensive because claims made in the lawsuit intertwine abortion access and Satanism.

It is the job of the journalist to bring newsworthy information to the public. TST's case against the state of Texas is the first of its kind: it will establish a legally-groundbreaking precedent not just for  TST’s religious abortion ritual, but also for the application of religious liberty protections. The media has publicly revealed their cowardice and lack of integrity by selectively choosing which legitimate  news stories the public should know.

Was Margaret Sanger a racist? Various links and sources disproving this,"[Abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3884362/)
PIP: Margaret Sanger, as a young public health nurse, witnessed the sickness, disease and poverty caused by unwanted pregnancies. She spent the rest of her life trying to alleviate these conditions by bringing birth control to America. During the early 20th century, the idea of making contraceptives generally available was revolutionary. Contraceptive usage was considered a distinguishing feature of the 'haves.' In recent years, some revisionist biographers have portrayed Sanger as a eugenicist and a racist. This view has been widely publicized by critics of reproductive rights who have attempted to discredit Sanger's work by discrediting her personally. The basic concept of the eugenics movement in the 1920s and 1930s was that a better breed of humans would be created if the 'fit' had more children and the 'unfit' had fewer. This concept influenced a broad spectrum of thought, but there was little consensus on the definitions of fit and unfit. In theory, the movement was not racist--its message intended to cross race barriers for the overall advancement of mankind. Most eugenicists agreed that birth control would be a detriment to the human race and were opposed to it. Charges that Sanger's motives for promoting birth control were eugenic are not supported. In part of her most important work, ""Pivot of Civilization,"" Sanger's dissent from eugenics was made clear. By examining extracts from her books, the author refutes the notion that Sanger was a eugenicist. Another unsupported argument raised by the anti-Sanger group was that Sanger, in her position as editor of ""Birth Contol Review,"" published eugenicists' views. It would be more accurate to say that the review covered a wide range of opinions and research; the eugenicists views were included because they conferred respectability. David Kennedy, author of ""Birth Control in America,"" does Sanger a grave injustice by falsely attributing to her the quotation: 'More children from the fit, less from the unfit--that is the chief issue of birth control.' This quotation should be attributed to the editors of ""American Medicine."" The only area Sanger is in agreement with the eugenicists is in her belief that severely retarded people should not bear children. Several authors, including Linda Gordon, argued that Sanger's interest in providing contraceptives to black Americans was motivated by racism. This notion is entirely misconstrued by distortions of language quoted by Sanger. Rather than wanting to exterminate the Negro population, Sanger wanted to cope with the fear of some blacks that birth control was the white man's way of reducing the black population.

Sanger’s legacy has been complicated by her support of eugenics, the idea that selective breeding for desired heritable characteristics could improve future generations of humans—an idea that was popular in the early 20th century (though it was later debunked). At the time Sanger began her work with birth control, eugenics was championed by well-known and respected scientists. It is unclear how extensively Sanger was involved in the eugenics movement, though she did believe that birth control could be used to prevent the breeding of unfit individuals. In addition, through the “Negro Project,” working closely with NAACP leader W.E.B. Du Bois, Sanger brought birth control to African American communities. As a consequence of these actions, critics have described Sanger as racist. However, as with her work in white communities, Sanger emphasized the importance of giving African Americans choices about parenthood and the number of children they wished to have. It is generally accepted that Sanger’s notions were no more racist than those found in society in general at the time.

[Love or Babies: Must Negro Mothers Choose](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=320905.xml)
By Margaret Sanger

Last year 40,000 Negro mothers and babies died in childbirth in this country.

They died, for the most part, as a result of inadequate medical attention, poor living conditions, improper diet and many other ills, which taken together made for mothers who were poor maternity risks from the start.

It is fair to suppose that most of the women who died were wives who loved their husbands--wives who were eager to live, to make homes and to raise their children. The answer to this love was 40,000 deaths. 40,000 deaths which might have been prevented had these births been planned instead of left to chance.

It has been argued occasionally that Negros do not need birth control. What is needed, it is said, are better living conditions, better working conditions, more medical services, improved diets and schools. Of course they are and by dint of the efforts of all those who believe in justice, these will be achieved.

But in the meantime, in the immediate here and now, Negro parents need birth control to help alleviate some of the needless suffering and heartbreak, to get firmly established on the road to health and better living. Even if the Negros lived in Utopia the need to plan their families would still be an urgent health and social measure.

I heard a story recently, a true story, about a Negro minister in one of the Southern states. He is a man of great faith and leadership. During the week he is a farmer, but on Sundays he preaches in two of the four churches of which he is pastor. He and his wife have had seventeen children. Only ten survived.

“We knew we were having too many children,” he told a visitor not long ago, “lots more than we could hope to raise and send to school. After the eighth one was born I went in to see the doctor. I asked him what we could do about it but he just grinned and said the only thing he knew for me to do was sleep in the barn!”

That story reminded me vividly of another story--one that happened thirty years ago in a lower Eastside New York tenement. I was working as a public health nurse at the time and one sticky mid-July day I was sent to care for a young mother who was near death from a criminal abortion. The crowded, airless rooms already held more children than her husband’s meager earnings could support and she had taken desperate measures to avoid the immediate birth of another baby.

It was weeks before we could be sure this mother would live to raise the children she already had, and when the doctor finally pronounced her out of danger, she pleaded with him to tell her what to do to prevent a repetition of this near tragedy.

“What are you trying to do,” the doctor laughingly asked her, “have your cake and eat it too? You’d better tell your husband Jake to sleep on the roof.”

Three months later I was called back to the same tenement, to the same patient for the same reason. Only this time, the young mother who had loved her husband and wanted to rear her children--died.

That death was the beginning of the birth control movement in this country. I paced the streets that night determined to find a better answer for women than “tell your husband to sleep on the roof.”

Why should this same heart-breaking story be repeated over and over endlessly? Why need there be such bitter anguish and misery--so cruel a price on the love of a man and his wife--the love that should be cherished and protected as the most beautiful of all human relationships?

Why should that young mother have been forced to sever one of the most meaningful marriage bonds because she and her husband could not afford to feed and clothe another child? Why should the Southern minister have been forced to choose between sacrificing the warmth and affection of his marriage or creating a life which he could not support?

What kind of reasoning is it that says such human tragedy cannot and should no be prevented?

Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam, the great Methodist leader and president of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America gave the answer in his address before the 25th annual dinner of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York this January. Bishop Oxnam said:

“The love of a man and a wife are sacred. Those who insist that there shall be no expression of that loved except for the purpose of procreation are not defenders of the family. They bring to the most sacred of all human relationships a blight of an asceticism that is blasphemous.”

Bishop Oxnam added that it is “the sacred right of every baby to be born with a descent chance for health, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

What then of the parents who have babies thoughtlessly, babies born only to die too soon, or to come into the world marked or deformed by disease, to be warped by bad environment? Do these parents not commit a crime against their own children?

I am deeply aware of the needless hazards to which Negro babies are subjected at birth in the United States at the present time. Last year 77 per cent of all white babies were born in hospitals, but less than half of the Negro mothers--43 per cent to be exact--were given hospital protection for themselves and their babies. Some day, if plans of such agencies as the U.S. Public Health Service are realized, there will not be a single section of the country without adequate hospital facilities for all. But until that day is here, Negro mothers should be given all possible protection against needless sacrifice through childbearing.

We may never achieve the goal of having every pregnancy end with the birth of a healthy, normal child, but certainly a vast majority of the 17,000 stillbirths which occur to Negro mothers each year could be prevented if every baby were planned. Mothers in poor physical condition, mothers who are suffering from chronic diseases, who are sustaining themselves on inadequate diets or performing work out of all proportion to their strength, should have the means to avoid childbearing until their own physical situation can be improved. It is wicked that such women should be expected to bear a baby every year or to deny the love of their husbands. The fact that such pregnancies so frequently end in miscarriage or still-birth makes this burden as pointless as it is cruel.

Then there is the matter of housing. Housing is haunting all America today, but to Negro America it is an old familiar story, made more acute by postwar conditions. The fact that 45 per cent of the Negro population lives in sub-standard housing, together with the fact that four-fifths of all Negro babies are born in states that have less than the national average income, helped to swell the total of 12,000 babies who died in 1945 before that were one year old and the other who failed to survive their first month of life.

The real answer, of course, is better housing. All America is now aware of this gnawing need. But until this housing takes shape in wood and stone and indoor plumbing, lets not make physical and emotional casualties of too many innocent children. Dr. Gunnar Myrdal, in his thoughtful study of the Negro America, An American Dilemma, points out that “poverty and slum conditions under which most city Negros live, encourages the formation of criminal gangs. . . . Negro children brough-up under such conditions have two strikes against them before they come of age.”

According to the Rev. James H. Robinson, pastor of Harlem’s Church of the Master, less than 35 per cent of all children in our overcrowded juvenile courts and orphan homes are really orphans. Most of them have one or both parents living but these parents are quite incapable of or indifferent to providing them with a wholesome home environment. Our children’s courts are filled with the inevitable victims of poor marriages and broken homes.

For those who argue for a high birth rate at any cost, the birth of these children makes a fine showing--there are thousands and thousands of them and their number is increasing. During the war years both the marriage rate and the birth rate reached all time highs. Only our current divorce rate threatens to top it.

Right now, one out of every four marriages is ending in divorce. By 1960 it is estimated there will be one divorce for every two marriages.

What then of the safety and security of the babies conceived and born before their parents had a chance to test their marriage and be sure it was on a firm and enduring foundation? No one can argue that both society at large and the individual children would have fared better had these parents waited until they were reasonably sure their marriages would last before undertaking the greatest of all human responsibilities, the creation of a new life.

Not long ago I was invited to visit a venereal disease clinic--a place of modern equipment, effective publicity and elaborate follow-up systems. Seven expectant mothers were sitting in the reception room that morning among the dozens of other patients who were awaiting treatment.

“They must be new patients,” I thought, “this is probably their first visit here. I hope they’ve come in time to protect their babies.”

I asked the very efficient nurse about it. Were these new patients who had learned of the clinic’s services after they had become pregnant?

“Oh, no,” the nurse replied, “they are all regular patients. Some of them have been under treatment for months.”

“But surely,” I said, “you give them advice on planned parenthood. You explain the risks a woman runs of infecting her baby, of having a stillborn or deformed child, if she and her husband aren’t in good physical condition themselves when they start to have a baby?”

“We don’t talk about birth control if that’s what you mean,” the nurse answered. “But we keep a very careful check and if the woman should stop her treatments too soon and have an infected baby, we are sure to catch it and bring the child in for treatments!”

In other words, this clinic doesn’t tell its patients how to postpone having a baby until it is safe for both the mother and the infant, but is eager to help her pick up the pieces after the damage is done and treat the infected child.

Each year there are 60,000 babies born in this country with congenial syphilis. With adequate medical attention many of these babies could grow up into healthy, normal, useful adults. But so far we don’t have anything like adequate medical facilities and the majority of these babies won’t get the treatment they need. Many of them will grow up unaware of what is the matter with them and will in turn hand on this blight to their children.

If, for the sake of a high birthrate, we are going to continue to deny planned parenthood information to married couples suffering from tuberculosis and venereal disease, let us set up the medical services to care for these children first and then have the babies.

Let’s stop talking about better housing and screened windows after the baby has died of a fly-bourne disease. Let’s screen the windows first and then bring the baby home.

I am tired of hearing people clamor for higher and ever higher birth rate because, they say, “America is capable of raising enough food to feed twice her present population.”

I don’t doubt it for a moment, but let’s till the soil and raise the food first and then have all the healthy, well-fed babies the country can hold.

This country echoes with the voices of juvenile court judges who say, “It is the parents, not the children who are delinquent.” Let us urge those who want and are interested in children to have as many as they desire, but let’s not force parenthood on men and women who regard the greatest of all human privileges with mortal fear or regard children with indifference or as nuisances.

Good parents are not created by chance and accident. Good parenthood is the result of deep love and thoughtful planning. It is closely allied with things of the spirit and the emotions as well as with physical functions. It should come only as the manifestation of the real and enduring love of a man and a woman--welcomed as the tangible evidence of this lasting bond.

For the child the security of love is even more important, for a child needs abiding love above all other things. True, he needs good housing, good food, good care and good schooling, but most of all he needs love and the assurance he is wanted, that his coming meant a valued and cherished addition to the family.

This is every baby’s birthright, the birthright planned parenthood seeks to give him, by making it possible for his parents to plan his arrival when they will themselves be healthy, when they will be able to give him at least the minimum essentials of good care and above all, welcome him with love because they really want him. Babies are too precious to be left to chance.

The Negro race has reached a place in its history when every possible effort should be made to have every Negro child count as a valuable contribution to the future of America. Negro parents, like all parents, must create the next generation from strength, not from weakness; from health, not from despair.

The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, with headquarters at 501 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N.Y., is endeavoring to aid all parents in planning the birth of their children so that the health and security of each child may be assured.

The Hannah Stone Maternal Health Center in Harlem is now engaged in a demonstration of planned parenthood as a measure of better health. The demonstration was begun after a city-wide survey revealed that maternal and infant deaths and stillbirth rates were twice, and in some cases, three times as high in Harlem as in any other part of Manhattan. To help lower these rates, the Maternal Health Center is taking an active part in the community health program. Its services are available to all married women whose incomes are not large enough to allow for the expense of private medicine. The bi-racial staff provides child spacing service; consultation on infertility, to help one out of every ten married couples who want children but find they do not have them; and marriage counselling, which is an increasingly important part of the planned parenthood program.

Seven states now include planned parenthood in their public health programs, making reliable medical help available to parents who seek to plan their families. In most other states clinics and maternal heath centers are operated by local planned parenthood groups. Their fees are made to fit the individual family’s ability to pay.

There is no longer need for doctors to tell husbands to “sleep in the barn.” Today’s wife needs no longer choose between her husband’s love and the health and security of her family. A better answer has been found. Our job now is to make that better answer--planned parenthood--known to all married couples who want and need it.",t2_n6epl,1614364595,prochoice

What can we do to fight the lack of education?,"The longer I debate abortion with pro-lifers, the more I realize that a lot of their believes are rooted in a severe lack of basic education when it comes to the human body and how everything works.

Sure, for some, it is willful ignorance. But for many, it seems to be a matter of actual complete misinformation.

Lately, I've come to the conclusion that many truly, honestly believe that there is no major difference at all between a ZEF and a newborn. And definitely no difference between a fetus shortly before birth and a newborn.

As a matter of fact, I've recently come to realize that many actually believe that a fetus that was perfectly fine and alive right before birth actually dies during delivery if it is a stillborn.

They think that something stopped that stillborn from being able to sustain life, rather than what actually happened: that it's life sustaining organ system function never kicked it. It's still alive the same exact way it was in the womb, but it is now disconnected from the mother's organ systems, and since its own didn't kick in, its life never started and its physical components will die as a result of lack of organ function capable of sustaining them.

They have absolutely no knowledge about what vital organ system function actually is. They have no idea that just because it can use oxygen, it doesn't mean it uses a respiratory system. That just becaue it can use nutrients, it doesn't mean it uses a digestive system. That just because it has a primitive circulatory system, it doesn't mean the circulatory system is the same as that of a liveborn newborn. Heck, they keep asking what this magical thing is that happens when a baby passes through the birth canal.

They don't comprehend that most of a person's body parts all use oxygen and nutrients and are living, but that doesn't mean they can sustain life.

I just had a discussion with another pro-lifer in which I mentioned that a human organism with no organ systems that work together harmoniously to independently provide all the functions necessary to sustain life is not the same as a human organism that does have such organ system functions. They're not equal, because one is a body that can sustain life, the other isn't.

And they came back with this:

*""you need to at the very least come up with a criteria that differntiates a child in the womb from a child out of the womb, which yours doesn't.""*

What do you even say to that? Where do you start? This person is convinced that there is no criteria that differentiates a child in the womb from a child out of the womb. This person thinks that since they both use oxygen and nutrients, they are identical.

I told them I clearly did point out the criteria: Vital organ system function.

Respiratory system

Digestive system

Circulatory system

To name three major ones.

We're going to have to give these people biology and medicine 101 classes to get through to them.

This is way more than a problem with personal believes. It's a matter of complete lack of basic education on how human bodies function.

What can we do to change this? Appeal to the education system?",t2_z4bdn6f,1614319866,prochoice

What about the mother?,"I am a birth mother. I had my daughter at age 17. My parents did not know I was pregnant until I was 8 months pregnant. Abortion was not an option. So I gave her up for adoption. Pro-lifers advocate for adoption like it's the easy thing to do. I could not tell you how much I cried and screamed during that time going through adoption. The amount of pain I felt. I cannot describe it. 

For weeks after I saw her for the last time, I laid in my bed and watched YouTube and cried. That's all I did. I was so broken. I still feel broken. It's only been a little over a year and there is still a giant void eating away at my heart. I constantly feel like I am missing something. But apparently this was the easy choice. Apparently this is better than abortion. Apparently suffering silently because nobody else in my life could even comprehend what I was going through was the right thing. Now let me say I do not regret it. I would never go back in time and get an abortion if I knew my daughter would come from that pregnancy. I am so happy I gave a family a beautiful baby girl. But I sacrificed all of my mental health for her. I sacrificed my soul for her to have a good life because I couldn't give it to her. 

About 6 months after she was born I got pregnant again. I was faced with 3 choices. 1. Have the baby and struggle to give it even the most basic of needs and not go to college. 2. Have the baby, give another child up for adoption. 3. Get an abortion. Even though every fiber of my being was telling me to have the baby and keep it to fill that void, I knew I couldn't. So I got an abortion. Wow that was a lot easier than carrying a baby for 9 months, going through 12 hours of labor just to be completely immobilized by grief and depressed. 

Pro-lifers don't know the struggle. I'm sorry but if a pro-lifers ever tells me to ""just give it up for adoption"" I will lose my shit at them. I have been through that hell and it is an actual hell. Sure I was sad when I got the abortion but it has not left a void in me. 

They do not care about the mother. They do not care about the truama a mother has to go through in either situation. Giving birth knowing that might be the only time you see your child is traumatic. Abortion can be traumatic and usually is. But who cares about the human being that will remember the traumatic part? It's all about the baby. Now, yes adoption is about the baby but there's a mother behind that baby.

Anatomy of Punishment Discussions on /r/prolife,"Every two or three months there's a post in /r/prolife about ""if abortion should be illegal, what should the punishment be?""

Here are four features you might see in these posts.  They’re in order of how often I find them, and they also build off of each other in the order I’ve presented them.

I wrote this because I had some stuff to get off of my chest, but also because I’ve been looking at these posts for about a decade now and things have *changed* and I want to save you all the trouble of keeping an eye on it yourselves.  Also, some people said very nice things about my writing on another subreddit and clearly it has gone to my head.

---

**1. A binary between ""the woman"" and ""the doctor.""**

Often this is so assumed that it's part of the question: ""what should the punishment be for the woman? How about the doctor?""

I dislike this for a lot of reasons.  First, it implies that women don't perform abortions and doctors don't get abortions, both of which are false.  This may seem insignificant, but anti-choice people routinely use that binary, once established, to discuss differences between ""the woman"" and ""the doctor.""  These differences generally involve ""the woman"" not really knowing what was going on, or being coerced, while ""the doctor"" had no excuse -- in other words, they strip ""the woman"" of her status as an informed moral agent.  They infantilize her.

Second, it implies that all people who get abortions are women.  Use those words and some ignorant transphobe will start saying it's ridiculous!  Men can't get abortions!  Impossible!  You'll be tempted to go down the transmen/nonbinary path, and you should point it out eventually, but when I'm feeling petty I draw it out a little more.  ""You're 100% sure that women and only women can get abortions?  Biologically impossible for anybody else?""  Then I remind them that girls exist.

Another reason I dislike it is that it feels like gender essentialism.  Even if people under 18 or trans people never needed abortions, I’d still dislike it.  Something about saying “the woman” and having it be automatically assumed that one is referring to the person who needs an abortion seems reductive to me.

Now, I say “the pregnant person,” which is still a little reductive.  Pregnant people perform abortions!  Pregnant people have other properties that being pregnant!  But at least “the pregnant person” is centering what’s relevant in this case: that they are pregnant.  It also includes the reminder that they’re a person, which I find important in these conversations.  I will sometimes start with “the pregnant person seeking/having an abortion” and then resort to “the pregnant person” for shorthand subsequently.

**2. A caricature of people performing and having abortions.**

This is the part that I’m most fascinated by.  For people who believe in fetal personhood, the only way that they can imagine performing an abortion is being psychopathic or otherwise callously malicious and homicidal.  The only way they can imagine having an abortion is being either callously infanticidal, or being ignorant or coerced.

I’m partly fascinated because I’ve taken care of these people as patients.  People in situations they didn’t think they’d have to confront, who are shocked and amazed to be treated with kindness and love.  Sometimes they’re “easy patients,” because their expectations for me and my team are so low.  All we have to do is not be callous psychopaths, after all.  Sometimes they’re challenging socially because they’re so pent-up with their self-hatred, or they’re busy judging the other patients, “I’m not like them” type stuff.  That’s tough for us.

I’m also fascinated because I think that this is the core of empathy and understanding the world: empathizing with others’ reasons for taking their actions.  I try to practice this kind of empathy, including with anti-choicers, and I think that’s improved my life.

Anyway, people using this reasoning are failing at empathy.  They use their moral and logical principles and follow it out to a conclusion, then stand by that conclusion (that an abortion can never be had or performed from a place of love) even when it is clearly contradicted by real-world evidence.

For example, I’ve seen it argued in these threads that people who have children and also have an abortion should lose custody of their children.  A child going from a stable home to the custody of the state is a very malignant intervention; it causes great harm to the child.  But for the people making this argument, it’s a logical conclusion: “the woman” has killed one child, why should she have custody of the other?

So this argument contains the theory that people who have abortions are more likely to kill their (born) children.  (You have to specify “born” if you’re talking with somebody who wants to use the word “children” to refer to fetuses, at least, if you want to make any progress.)  This theory is demonstrably false: most people having abortions have children, and there’s no epidemic of these people killing their children.  I’ve taken care of many women having abortions out of love for the children they already have.  And yet, the argument remains.

More recently, I saw somebody argue for my death by capital punishment.  Their reasoning was that, if I were incarcerated, I would pose too great a threat to other inmates.  This particular Redditor opined that maybe the other inmates would be safe, because I only want to prey on the helpless, but still, it was too great a risk to take.  Just stay on the safe side and execute me.

Now, there’s a lot to unpack here, including the “pro-life” hypocrisy.  It’s easy to laugh at the idea of me being a threat to other inmates, especially if you know me.  But what’s at the core here is what we’re discussing in this section: that they have only imagined *me* as how I might exist if I had *their* values, and the shortest step to imagining that is psychopathy.

I want to learn how to help them imagine me as a complex, caring human.  I hope that them thinking of physicians who perform abortions as full people instead of caricatures will do two things.  I hope it will help them have a fuller understanding of the world and a richer life experience.  I also hope it will make them less likely to shoot me or my friends someday.

**3. Dissonance between anti-choicers.**

A.k.a., “the Donald Trump moment.”  Remember when he was asked, “what should the punishment be?  And in his classic, Teflon way, he said, “well, there’s gotta be some kinda punishment.”  Pressed for details, “we’ll see, we’ll see.”

Then everybody reminded him that was unpopular, and he said, “okay, none for the woman.  Punish the doctor.”

You’ll get that in the comments in these threads.

There’s a terrorist inciter named Randall Terry who started a group called Operation Rescue in 1986.  Operation Rescue had a saying, ""If you believe abortion is murder, act like it's murder.""  This is a saying designed to make people shoot me, so I hesitate to share it.

This slogan was behind a lot of anti-abortion terrorism in the 1990s: firebombing clinics, assassinating doctors, that kind of thing.  There’s been less of this since 2000 or so, but not none -- the shooting of Dr. Tiller, the shooting at the Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, and last month’s shooting into a Knoxville abortion clinic… this is an ongoing issue.

However, on the public stage it has fallen into disfavor; anti-choice forces have gained ground with TRAP laws and waiting periods and piecewise restrictions.  Domestic terrorism has been less appreciated by the public since 9/11 (though that may be changing) and that may be way there’s somewhat less anti-abortion violence than in the 90s.  Instead, we see the “act like it’s murder” approach in these comment threads.

Some commenters will take the publicly-palatable, infantilizing, “the woman was coerced, show her mercy” approach, and others will take the “she was an accessory to murder, punish her accordingly” approach.  I’ve also sometimes seen a middle ground, “mandatory counseling” approach.  Re-education with Aunt Lydia, anyone?

**4. Some truly wild conspiracy theories.**

I think that this is best summed up by one /r/prolife contributor, speaking about our government,  “we won’t have justice and freedom until that cabal of Masonists is driven into the sea.”

Moloch may come up.  Moloch may once have been the name of a pre-Judaism semitic god referenced in Leviticus.  In the middle ages, this was interpreted as a bull-headed god to whom people sacrificed children, and the deity has been used as a synecdoche for sacrifice ever since.  This is a fine allegory that has been used to describe Hitler, factories, automobiles, and abortion (since the 1800s).  I have nothing against the allegory, and I understand why people who believe in fetal personhood may feel that many abortions constitute sacrifice of the fetus for the sake of the pregnant person’s non-existential well-being.

But something interesting has happened in the last decade or so, where a lot of people seem to be taking this well-established allegory literally and think that physicians performing abortions are literally doing a deal with a devil.  (I think that many of these people see Moloch as an incarnation of Satan.)  Again, this is one way of imagining how abortions work if you can’t imagine an abortion coming from a place of love and care: the physician is doing it in exchange for… something.  I’ve never been clear on what Moloch’s end of the bargain is.

Sometimes the other end of the bargain is adrenochrome.  Adrenochrome is a real chemical (oxidized adrenaline), and there is a conspiracy theory in which powerful people kill children to harvest their adrenochrome.  It became more prominent with the pizzagate/QAnon/pedophilia conspiracies around Hillary Clinton, and has now combined with the Planned Parenthood fetal-parts manufactured controversy to include adrenochrome harvesting from abortion.  There are a lot of holes in these theories, but we’re not here to point them out.  Like with Moloch, this is a way for people to imagine physicians performing abortions for a reason they can make sense of, rather than out of love, which would challenge their core beliefs.

These ideas typically involve large cover-ups and a wealthy elite class somehow benefiting, i.e from the adrenochrome.  The exact brand of this step of the conspiracy varies.  If they’re saying “globalists,” you should be aware that’s a reference to the anti-Semitic idea of a Jewish ruling world order.  If it’s “Masonists,” it’s a similar conspiracy theory but with Freemasons.  This step of the conspiracy is important to explain away questions like “why is it legal?” and “if adrenochrome makes you immortal or whatever, why not just synthesize it and mass-produce it?”

So if you get any of these vibes from somebody you’re talking to about abortion, remember that they’re more comfortable with having contradictions in their *observations* (that, despite no evidence, a cabal of globalists sacrifices children to Moloch for adrenochrome) than they are having contradictions in their *values* (that abortion is something that loving, kind people can choose to have or provide).  Tune your approach accordingly.

I hope this has brought you some insight.

I want to be clear: I think it is possible to build a cohesive worldview that includes a belief in fetal personhood.  I think it’s possible to do so in a way that doesn’t fall into any of the negative patterns I’ve outlined above.  I even have sympathy for people who, say, believe in fetal personhood but also want elected officials who don’t fly to Cancun when the going gets tough.  I just also think that most anti-choicers *do* fall into these traps of misogyny, failures of empathy, and fantastical thinking.

It’s not a baby it’s a fetus,"It is the start of a baby but right now it’s just an accumulation of cells and biological process with zero sentience. 

You kills bugs everyday. It’s no different. The fetus hasn’t become a baby yet and doesn’t know anything. If it dies it might feel a bit of pain but in the end it’s none the wiser. It doesn’t know or care about the life it never had it didn’t know or emotionally feel anything. It has no regrets or memories to reflect on.

When you know there’s a high chance that if you have the baby it will have a shitty life, or you will have a shitty life because of it, stop it from becoming a baby. Why bring a person into a life of suffering and possibly a slow and painful death of something like starvation when you can nip it in the bud and prevent that from happening in the first place? Before the fetus could ever know or comprehend what it’s missing by not growing into a baby and being born.

The person who does know what life they could be missing out on is the mother who knows what she could lose if a baby is born, or even what the baby could lose. 

What if they just lost nothing. The fetus can’t lose what it never had and the birth mom doesn’t lose whatever she’s risking by having a baby.

If Embryos Could Be Artificially Raised,"Apologies if this concept has been asked recently...

I was thinking of that idiot US politician that said that ectopic pregnancies could be just moved to the uterus and made viable. And then thought about what if that could actually happen, but that the fertilized embryo could be removed from the woman altogether and placed in an artificial womb, what would happen then?

Consider the bill being footed by the tax payer the same way it is for children that are given up to the foster care system...would that spark protests from PL folk? Or both PL and PC? I’m betting nobody would be FOR making taxes pay to gestate humans if there aren’t parents in the picture to take the brunt of it.

Sure you’d probably get a fair number of them adopted by the people who wait for brand new babies. 
But not all. There are so many unwanted pregnancies that if getting them removed was an option and abortion wasn’t, it seems like the foster care system would be flooded.

But if they also did genetic testing just like they do for wanted pregnancies and they come up as abnormal or incompatible with life, what would happen then? Would PL people fight for their right to live anyway, given that as embryos they are wards of the state and there’s no parent to blame, no hospital bills being used to punish the people that made them?

Personally, if it was my embryo, I would not want MY egg being raised into a living human against my will, regardless of whether or not it’s happening in my body or in an artificial environment. It’s my genetic material and that of someone whom I did not want to create more life with. Wouldn’t it be reasonable for me to decide whether this embryo is gestated and put out into the world, given that it’s my own material from my own body?

Pro choice thought experiment,"So I work with a lot of pro-life (I like to call them anti-freedom) conservative republican men, and as a progressive woman I know better than to talk to them about politics. However the other day the topic of pro choice/pro forced birth came up and I was so livid with my male coworker I left work after getting approval from my boss after I heard his thoughts on the matter. We went back and fourth about the usual arguments and basically he straight up told me women should not have sex if they can accept the consequences of becoming pregnant.  So I got to hypothetically thinking about a question I could ask these types of men that might help change their perspective or at least realize how asinine that argument is. Men clearly don’t value the lives of their individual sperm right? They murder millions of those little effers every day... they also don’t seem to really value the potential life of women’s eggs either, because I don’t see men going around trying fish out an egg from my uterus every time I’m ovulating/pmsing to save the egg from my period. It’s only when the two meet that they are given this holy pedestal that must be protected at all costs... So say hypothetically every woman on earth evolved a very special uterus that would expel eggs at extreme force when they orgasm with such precision it would shoot the egg into male testicles. Where there it would become fertilized and instantly the man would be aware of it because the introduction of the conception would block their ability to come. Let’s also hypnotically say that along with these precision sniper uteruses we have developed that the eggs also have evolved to be able to survive outside of a womb, and would be able to survive inside men as well. So I would ask them this, how would you feel about sex if every time you wanted to get your rocks off, you run the risk of potentially carrying around a 9 lb fetus in your balls for 9 months? would you like the option to not have to walk around with your nuts in a wheelbarrow like in South Park...or do you think the government should have the right to force you to turn yourself into a human wrecking ball? I’m really curious to see what they would say. I’m also curious if this is even a good question to ask at all...  I just get SO FRUSTRATED when talking to guys about this because they literally have no concept of what it’s like to be pregnant and how much of a big deal it is to be forced to give birth that I’m wondering if using such insane logic would get them to see how insane their logic for being anti-choice is....",t2_2uxdn8me,1613971189,prochoice

The scientific and medical ignorance of anti choicers makes my blood boil,"(For context I’m a medical student)

First and foremost I believe in body autonomy (same reason why tying down random people for organs to save a life is ethically wrong) which is why I’m pro choice. On top of that, the ignorance of the anti choice community is dangerous and astounding.

If terminating a pregnancy is inherently wrong, then is miscarriage or a stillbirth fucking manslaughter?! Do you have ANY idea of how common that is?! Sometimes people don’t even KNOW they’re pregnant and have a miscarriage and it’s a heavier period. The kind of guilt patients who undergo miscarriage and stillbirth internalize is directly related to the shit they spew, when the vast majority of the time it happens to defects that are not compatible with life in the future.

And then the whole heartbeat shit. The fetal heartbeat is literally a flap of tissue in a tube. And yet saving that is more important than an actual human being.

And don’t get me started on molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia, and how downright dangerous pregnancy can be. How people who are pregnant - and yes, sometimes in the second or third trimester - can be diagnosed with metastatic cancer or uncontrollable high blood pressure. So saving your life for a literal fetus is wrong?! Do they not understand that if the pregnant person dies so the fetus will not progress to being born?!?

I wouldn’t care so much if these people didn’t have power. But they do. I’m from Latin America, the way people die and discarded there, especially young (cis) girls, for a fucking embryo and fetus is heartbreaking.

I’m beyond eVeRyOnE hAs A dIfFeReNt OpInIoN and oh but it’s my religion like. If you PERSONALLY would not have an abortion I fully support that decision and want to help you through the pregnancy. I support people who want to be pregnant, that’s equally a part of reproductive justice. Having wanted pregnancies is a beautiful thing. Literally when my mother was pregnant with me it came as a surprise and she’s pro choice but wouldn’t want to have an abortion herself so she went through with the pregnancy (she also knew she eventually wanted a second child so it worked out). But as someone who was an accidental pregnancy guess what? You don’t get to control other people. My story doesn’t justify your bullshit beliefs 

And the religion argument lollll my dad went to an all boys catholic school in Latin America and came out pro choice it’s called being religious and not using your religious convictions to oppress other people.

Pro life relies on emotion,"Even when you can get them to admit that stripping women of their bodily integrity is wrong, they fall back on 'but it's her child! Her own flesh and blood!!' I feel like they hate abortion because in their eyes, the woman is 'murdering' her 'child' in the womb, which goes against society's expectation for women to be nurturing and motherly. It's also the same reason they don't talk about IVF- because women using IVF are 'fulfilling their role in society' by trying to become a mother. It doesn't matter if embyros are killed if the woman in question just wants to be a mother, amirite? 

It's no coincidence that many of them, especially PL women, come from rural, usually southern, areas where they have been raised with traditional values and taught that a woman's role is to make babies. It's honestly sad because I feel like a lot of PL women don't see themselves as anything more than walking baby incubators. I can imagine not wanting an abortion ever because I don't like it, but I can't imagine not even wanting that right for myself. I mean, if you're a woman you could be impregnated from rape at any time, and you're telling me you should be forced to gestate a fetus someone forced inside you??!! Seriously what the hell.

Also, it's laughable that they literally refuse to call the ZEF anything except baby or child. And when they show up at abortion clinics with posters, it's always a picture of a smiling toddler, because they know a zygote wouldn't generate the same emotions.",t2_7vjuchsg,1613912395,prochoice

What if the woman consents to the pregnancy?," I 100% believe that consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy.

But what if the woman DID consent to pregnancy? She was trying to get pregnant.

So I started thinking, what if she got pregnant but than decided that she no longer wanted to be pregnant? Withdrawing her consent to pregnancy - which I still completely support. I believe that consent can be withdrawn, that's just how consent works. 

Now I started comparing this withdrawal of consent to the withdrawal of consent for kidney donation or something like that (actually thought of this by remembering an episode from Grey's Anatomy lol). In the episode, from what I can remember, it was a multiple person kind of kidney transplant - they person a was giving to person b, person b to person c, etc. One of them backed out, which completely ruined the entire plan. That doesn't seem okay to me.

But isn't it kind of the same idea? A person consents to allow a part of their body to support another life, but than withdraws that consent. I feel like it's kind of hypocritical to respect a person's right to withdraw consent in one scenario but not another. 

Could someone please explain the difference to me? Is there some kind of document that an organ donor signs that makes it impossible to withdraw consent? There must be right? I know that Grey's Anatomy is not the most accurate thing ever lmao.

Poll on PC views,"So in speaking with another PC, a belief was brought up and I'm curious to get a more defined consensus on PC beliefs.

Do you believe that if someone chooses to continue pregnancy, that the NCP should be forced to be financially responsible against their will? 

The person I was speaking with seemed to think that most PC's believe they should. However, I've spoken to a lot that don't believe that. To further clarify, if the NCP decides they don't want to be financially responsible, there are many who believe that they should be able to sign away all rights (which would include visitation rights and communication and would basically act like the paternal parent is a stranger that has nothing to do with the child's life) to their child. If they later decided they wanted to be a part of their child's life, they wouldn't be able to just choose to because they no longer have that right.

How can I help someone who feels guilt about having had an abortion?,"Hi, everyone. 

My mom is the awesomest person I’ve ever met. She ended up having an abortion many years before I was born. She was in a marriage at the time that was controlling and in some ways abusive, so she was heavily pressured into this decision. From what I understand, it was just assumed by her then husband that this was what she was going to do. She didn’t have much support around her, and I hate the idea of her having to walk solo past a bunch of people holding up signs about how this decision was so evil and wrong. I didn’t assume that part, she mentioned it to me.

We’re not interested in this as a political thing, because we both think that there are a lot of problems going on in both parties. I do find it annoying that being pro choice tends to get one lumped in with one political party. Anyway, I say this because we know quite a few people who are more toward the conservative side, and some of the things they say (or even some things that are said by people in the general public) totally throw me and seem so callous in a way. 

Most of the people who share things like this are otherwise very nice people in day to day life. It really seems like they think they’re operating from a place of wanting to protect human life. I guess they see it as standing up for those who can’t stand up for themselves. 

Someone who’d had an abortion probably wouldn’t be comfortable talking about it after hearing/seeing something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x4ihwacqmgi61.jpg?width=220&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cdee92b7a21bb404cc5d0c9a5341d9ca531e216

I’ve heard my mom say that she still has a hard time dealing with guilt that she feels around having had the procedure. I feel in my gut that this picture isn’t totally right, but I can’t seem to pin down why. Meanwhile, I can’t imagine my silence (or the picture) helps with the guilt. So many people will say that abortion is murder. How can they say that and not also then have the belief (consciously or not) that someone who has an abortion would be a murderer. How much would you respect someone you think is a murderer? Probably not much, if at all. 

I can see how someone being convinced they’re a murderer could push them over the edge. I’ve never even been in the situation of having an abortion, but wow. It even makes me feel like shit. 

I mean, at a certain point in the pregnancy, a C-section would be more logical than an abortion in my opinion. But to say that every single abortion is some kind of murder doesn’t sit right with me.

Do they believe that those who have abortions should be tried for murder? 

I feel so at a loss when I see things like this that make the argument seem so much simpler than it really is, and my brain totally blanks on how I’m supposed to respond. 

I hate the idea of my mom seeing these things and then feeling worse about herself. What can I do to be helpful rather than just drawing a blank like I always do?",t2_9na80gjy,1613751732,prochoice

Need advice: I think abortion for disabilities is wrong but I feel compelled to support abortions anyway.,"I need advice. I feel like abortions for disability reasons is wrong. I understand if someone doesn't want to go through the pregnancy and I wouldn't tell them not to, but I still feel like it's wrong. People should be able to have the means to take care of disabled people for one thing which is why I support universal Health Care. I support a social democratic system similar to the Nordic countries for America. I wouldn't Force a woman to go through a pregnancy she doesn't want, but I just wish the mindset itself disappeared. The desire to terminate a pregnancy just because they are disabled.

How can I be pro-choice and still think that abortions for disabilities is bad?

And I don't just want to be told to support abortions or support a woman's right to choose because I do. I support a woman's right to choose, but I just still think it's wrong.",t2_1uitsl44,1613689918,prochoice

Stop asking 'would you agree with a woman getting an abortion for X reason',"Every so often, someone posts about a specific reason a woman might want an abortion and asks if we 'approve' of that reason or not. The most recent was about sex selective abortions. 

I'm so tired of it. Such questions would be better suited to r/abortiondebate instead. 

If you are pro choice, that means you believe every pregnant person should have the right to an abortion. So unless you generally concern yourself with the reasons why people undergo medical procedures, which would be weird and creepy as hell, you shouldn't give the slightest fuck why somebody wants an abortion.

The only reason anybody needs to get an abortion is that they are pregnant and don't want to be. I don't understand why this is such a hard concept for some people to grasp.

Have you had a medication abortion? PAID research study (RHODE ISLAND USA),"Researchers at the University of Ottawa would like to conduct 90-minute telephone interviews with anyone who has used mifepristone (also known as the abortion pill, medication abortion, or medical abortion) to end a pregnancy.

You are eligible if you: 

* Used mifepristone to have an abortion on or after January 1, 2015
* Were living in **Rhode Island** at the time
* Are sufficiently fluent in English or French to answer interview questions
* Have access to a telephone, Skype, or Zoom

During the interview, we will ask you series of questions about your background, your reproductive health history, and the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. We will also ask you to tell us about your experience obtaining an abortion with pills and we will ask you to tell us about ways in which you think that services could be improved.

All participants will receive a $40 gift certificate to [www.am](http://www.am/)[azon.com](http://azon.com/). Participation is both voluntary and confidential. Spots for this study are filled on a first come, first served basis.

Christian philosopher breaks down pro-life arguments,"[Here's](https://people.umass.edu/~lrb/files/bak05wheaP.pdf) an interesting and thoughtful piece by a Christian philosopher, Lynn Rudder Baker, that breaks down a lot of popular pro-life talking points about personhood. It's a good reminder too that Christianity and Christian philosophy is not inherently tied to a pro-life position.   


Lynne Rudder Baker shows that ""personhood begins at conception"" does not really make sense:  
"" I take the question “When does a human organism begin?” to be a biological question. This empirical question stands in contrast to the philosophical question “When does a human person begin?” (Empirical data are relevant to philosophical questions, without being conclusive.) One frequently heard answer to the biological question is that a human organism comes into existence at the time of fertilization of a human egg by a sperm. (But beware: There is not an exact moment of fertilization. Fertilization itself is a process that lasts twenty-plus hours.)  However, the view that a human organism comes into existence at—or at the end of—fertilization is logically untenable, because a fertilized egg may split and produce twins. If it is even physically possible for a fertilized egg to produce twins (whether it actually does so or not), a fertilized egg cannot be identical to an organism. As long as it is possible to twin, a zygote is not a human anything, but a cell cluster. In the case of twinning, as philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe explains: “Neither of the two humans that  eventually develop can be identified as the same human as the zygote, because they can’t both be so, as they are different humans from one another.” It is logically impossible for one organism to be identical to two organisms. And, of course, anything that is logically impossible is biologically impossible. In twinning, two (or more) twins come from a single fertilized egg. But neither of the twins is identical to that fertilized egg, on pain of contradiction...""  


If conception isn't the relevant factor to personhood, what is?   


"" What distinguishes person from other primary kinds (like planet or organism) is that persons have first-person perspectives. Just as a statue is not a piece of clay, say, plus some other part, so too a human person is not a human organism plus some other part. The defining characteristic of a person is a first-person perspective. Human persons are beings that have first person perspectives essentially and are constituted by human organisms (or bodies).  ""  


What does this mean for abortion?   


"" It is reasonable that, in any decision, whoever will bear the burden for the effects of the decision should have control over making it. The ultimate bearer of responsibility for having a baby is primarily the pregnant girl or woman, and to a lesser extent her sexual partner, her doctor, and other caregivers whom she may call upon for help. A new person does not come into existence until the fetus develops a rudimentary first person perspective, perhaps at birth, perhaps shortly before birth at the earliest.  Since fetal development is a gradual process, the closer the fetus comes to developing a rudimentary first-person perspective, the more cautious someone considering abortion should be. So, as long as we can be sure that there is no rudimentary first-person perspective—up through, say, the second trimester of pregnancy—the decision to abort should be in the hands of the pregnant girl or woman and her allies.""  


Obviously, this isn't the most radically pro-choice position, but Baker does keenly take apart a lot of the standard pro-life arguments. One further interesting thing she points out is that the ""life of the mother"" exception is not consistent with pro-life ""right to life"" arguments.   


""...if abortion were morally impermissible on the grounds that a fetus is a person—then morally speaking, there could be no exceptions to the prohibition of abortion in the case of anencephaly, or in the case of rape or incest, or in the case of saving the pregnant woman’s life. None of these considerations would be relevant to allowing abortion. (That most abortions have nothing to do with these extreme circumstances is irrelevant to the logical point.)

"If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, reproductive coercion should be a non-issue","
We all know the “consent to sex is consent to pregnancy” argument is utter bullshit, but let’s humor it for a second. If consent to sex really is consent to pregnancy, then there shouldn’t be anything wrong with reproductive coercion. According to anti-choice logic, any consensual sex - including sex where contraception is used - is consent to pregnancy and therefore obligates a person to carry to term. This already doesn’t carry logically because a person can’t legitimately consent to something while at the same time try to prevent it, but *whatever*.  

If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, sabotaging someone’s birth control should be a non-issue. According to anti-choicers, when an AFAB person consents to having sex, they’re agreeing to gestate and birth their partner’s ZEF in addition to taking on all the physical and mental risks of the process. To anti-choicers, the fact that the person used contraception is irrelevant so what does it matter if their partner decides to increase the chances of getting them pregnant? There shouldn’t be anything wrong with a man taking off a condom without a woman’s knowledge since, just by having sex, she’s already agreed to give birth. She’s already agreed to be pregnant so increasing the risk of pregnancy from 2% (98% effective with a condom) to about 20% (depending on where she is in her cycle) without her authority shouldn’t be an issue. 

Likewise, there shouldn’t be anything wrong with women poking holes in condoms because, just by agreeing to sex, the man has agreed to impregnate her. There’s nothing wrong with increasing the chances of something that your partner has already consented to, right? Stealthing, poking holes in condoms, flushing pills, discarding pills/patches, microwaving pills to mess up the chemical structure, lying about ovulation times, lying about taking birth control, lying about fertility - ANYTHING that can be done to render someone’s contraceptive methods ineffective should be acceptable if the act of sex alone is *truly* consent to pregnancy.

But it isn’t. Anti-choicers will continue to think otherwise, but they’re wrong. When I consent to sex, I’m consenting to sex and nothing more. Anti-choicers can cry all they want, if my birth control fails and I get pregnant, the only thing I’ll be consenting to is an abortion. Consent to sex is and will only ever be consent to the *risk* of pregnancy. If it were consent to pregnancy and childbirth itself, there wouldn’t be such a thing as reproductive coercion and it wouldn’t be considered a form of sexual abuse.",t2_2dlt6ebu,1613553495,prochoice
Pregnancy is hard,"I am a pro-choice future mom. After waiting until age 30 and a couple years of marriage, my husband and I decided we were ready to finally have kids. By choice. I am now about 30 weeks pregnant and I am in the hospital for complications. There's a very good likelihood I'll be here, in bed until I deliver.

Before being hospitalized my pregnancy was not the smoothest ride. I had bad morning sickness in the first trimester and was diagnosed with placenta previa in the second trimester and told to avoid exercise and sex.

This child is so wanted but this is not an easy or fun situation right now. I can't imagine being forced into this. I think pregnancy is glamorized so much in our society and people don't prepare you for the hardships that can come with it.

I'm working to mentally prepare myself for motherhood while dealing with the depressing reality of living in a hospital room for weeks, and only short visits with my husband due to covid restrictions. If I were younger or more immature and not in the headspace where I really desperately wanted my child, I might be having a mental health crisis. But I truly believe that because I was ready, had already had therapy for my own issues, and am excited to meet my son, that I am equipped to handle this hardship now.

"😇 Shower of thoughts: Inequality that favoritizes some people whilst discriminating, exploiting or abusing certain people based on gender, race, sex, sexuality or religion should not be upheld in any society.","There are other ways to reduce abortion without violating women.

🎯In such a society those issues should be addressed first so less or little unwanted pregnancies happen in the first place. Ie better birth control with less side effects, better education, far more support for expectant people, no sex shaming, free birth control, free education programs for parents after they had babies, job ready programs, free childcare classes, free preschool, free baby sitting sometimes per week, support for parents of disabled children, ie carer visits/nurse, help for people with disabilities that are pregnant or have new borns, welfare payments for expectant parents, payment for baby items to set up baby room, all education institutions must allow flexible study from distance or time off.

⚠️Either way, forcing women to stay pregnant prioritises the fetus and sets a precedence of rights for one person above that of the other which can not be consistently upheld in a equal society.
✅In society people should have equal rights. No person has rights to someone elses body, organs or blood.

Abortion Laws in Canada,"So fun fact: In Canada abortions are legal at any stage of pregnancy. We are the only country that allows this.

It makes them mentally uncomfortable the thought because they believe that the fetus has a right to the woman's body without having consent.

Sex is consent to the man only, if she gave consent to him. The fetus doesnt even exist yet to be given consent to! It also certainly does not ask for permission!
It has no consent!

They do realise this 
BUT

BUT this creates a huge amount of mental discomfort (cognitive dissonance) since not having consent is bad/very morally wrong.

Hence the prolifer is cognitively motivated to reduce their own mental discomfort of having a immoral belief (that the fetus has a right to literally use the woman's body and organs without consent), so they try to modify the actual meaning of consent mentally to get around it.

This is why they are soo motivated and endlessly say ""sex is consent"" ""if the woman has sex she is consenting to be pregnant, she is consenting to the fetus"".

Instead of just admitting that its wrong they try to brain wash themselves and others that engaging in one action with one person is consent to another person.

Which is just Ie rape ie assault. Ie insanity. 

They brain wash themselves to make themselves feel better about their own immoral beliefs

Quiotes by Conception=Life scientists..what,"Some quotes an anti choicer used at me. How can they say that life begins at conception when you're considered dead once your brain stops registering on an EEG and a fetss doesn't even register on an EEG until week 22+? 
Wtf is the truth. Are we alive even if we're brain dead but have a heart beat still? Is it murder to take somebody off of life support? Whys it not considered animal abuse to kill you dog via euthanasia?? Isnt it murder to kill inmates on death row?? 

Anyway, here are the quotes. Im so fed up. 

""It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception.""

Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth
Harvard University Medical School

""I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.""

Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni
Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania

""After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.""

Dr. Jerome LeJeune
Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes
""By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.""
Professor Hymie Gordon
Mayo Clinic

""The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter – the beginning is conception.""

Dr. Watson A. Bowes
University of Colorado Medical School

The American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in the Roe. vs. Wade opinion) that ""the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science. They deplored the “popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.”

“Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.”

Report, Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, 97th Congress, 1st Session 1981, 7.

""Biologically speaking, human development begins at fertilization.""
The Biology of Prenatal Develpment, National Geographic, 2006.

""Every baby begins life within the tiny globe of the mother's egg... It is beautifully translucent and fragile and it encompasses the vital links in which life is carried from one generation to the next. Within this tiny sphere great events take place. When one of the father's sperm cells, like the ones gathered here around the egg, succeeds in penetrating the egg and becomes united with it, a new life can begin.""
Geraldine Lux Flanagan, Beginning Life. New York: DK, 1996. p. 13.

""Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.""
E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3rd edition. Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975. p. vii.

""The term conception refers to the union of the male and female pronuclear elements of procreation from which a new living being develops.""
""The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.""
J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders, 1974. pp. 17, 23.

""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""
Clark Edward Corliss, Patten's Human Embryology: Elements of Clinical Development. New York: McGraw Hill, 1976. p. 30.

""The time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
Bruce M. Carlson, Patten's Foundations of Embryology, 6th edition.. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996. p. 3.

""Human embryos begin development following the fusion of definitive male and female gametes during fertilization... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
William J. Larsen, Essentials of Human Embryology. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998. pp. 1, 14.

""Human development begins at fertilization when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male. ""
Keith L. Moore, Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology, 9th edition. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier, 2008. Kindle Location 555.

""Development begins with fertilization, the process by which the male gamete, the sperm, and the female gamete, the oocyte, unite to give rise to a zygote.""
T.W. Sadler, Langman's Medical Embryology, 13th edition. Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer, 2015. p. 14.

""Human development begins at fertilization, approximately 14 days after the onset of the last menstrual period… when a sperm fuses with an oocyte to form a single cell, the zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""
Keith L. Moore, The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 10th edition. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier, 2016. Kindle Locations 739, 1094.

There is simply no doubt that even the early embryo is a human being. All its genetic coding and all its features are indisputably human. As to being, there is no doubt that it exists, is alive, is self-directed, and is not the the same being as the mother—and is therefore a unified whole.

Bernard N. Nathanson, M.D., The Hand of God (Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 1996), 131.

It is possible to give ‘human being’ a precise meaning. We can use it as equivalent to ‘member of the species Homo sapiens’. Whether a being is a member of a given species is something that can be determined scientifically, by an examination of the nature of the chromosomes in the cells of living organisms. In this sense there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being.

Can someone help me explain why this argument for abortion isn’t logical,"So I was having a discussion with my sister and her she has a friend from college. 

Her friends argument for abortion is that “my mom was originally pregnant with a boy before she was ready to have a baby, so that boy was aborted. Then a few years later the parents had me. If it wasn’t for abortion I wouldn’t exist. Why is my life less important than the unborn child?”

To me this sounds so stupid like how can you even make that argument, but I wasn’t able to cohesively put together a good response for why that has no logical basis.

"Former House Chaplain Enables Heresy, Uses Thomas Aquinas to Give Abortion Supporters Cover","  

“Thomas Aquinas says if your conscience says to do something the church says is a sin, you are bound to follow your conscience. That’s Thomas Aquinas! Thomas Aquinas says if your conscience says to do something the church says is a sin, you are bound to follow your conscience. That’s Thomas Aquinas!”… Father Pat Conroy, former chaplain for the U.S. House of Representatives, a Jesuit priest.

Three lessons from this article:

1. This priest is denying a Divine and Catholic dogma of the Catholic Church defined by Pope John Paul II in Evangelium Vitae in 1995. He is a material heretic and complicit in the murder of unborn babies.

2. To my knowledge this article is the only rebuke to this heretical priest that I have ever seen. Even this article soft pedals his horror and his Bishop never publicly rebuked him that I now of, which makes the Bishop complicit in mortal sin. 

3. Thomas Aquinas has done terrible damage to the unborn which continues until today. Aquinas described early gestation unborn babies as vegetables and animals which directly contradicts Sacred Scripture and he of all people should have known better. He believed Aristotle instead.",t2_afq1s9y0,1645721211,prolife

“It’s not a baby”,"Artificial wombs are getting better. And of course we allow children to grow for some time prior to implantation during IVF. 

I know, you don’t like the word “child” being used but… well, here they are outside a womb and they are alive and developing so… if it’s a matter of not being inside a uterus that makes one a child… I guess they ARE a child until they’re implanted, and then stop being a child for a while? 

But anyway, on to the real scenario. 

Let’s say we have an IVF situation where they are gestating a test tube baby. They have an artificial womb and they’re going to take that embryo and implant them in an artificial pod. The pod is see through and the health of the entity can be monitored and aided. Not really different from a natural womb, but maybe a bit more convenient for examination purposes. The pod can be expanded without opening it or removing the artificial umbilical cord or feeding tubes indefinitely as the entity develops normally. 

When does that entity become a “baby” or “child”?

Is it when the pod is opened? What if they simply expand the size of the pod as the entity develops? They might be a twenty year old by the time they open it. When opened, is that twenty year old now a baby?

Do they skip the baby step altogether somehow?

If so, how is that possible, and then, what is the relevance if a human is considered a baby to you or not?

Since by your admission, they might not even be a baby. So what are their rights?

Let’s say the entity develops like all other humans with the exception that they never crack the seal. They have all of their senses, all of their intelligence that they naturally develop, they learn to read and write- at what point is this entity a “baby” or “child”, and why is their location suddenly not relevant?",t2_cw1ci0i4,1645710541,prolife
Real life scenario- what would you do,"I hear a lot  that exceptions to banning abortion will be made if the mother’s life is in imminent danger. Although, that can occur with obstetric disasters a more common scenario is the mother with a pre-existing medical condition

There is a significant risk of catastrophic deterioration of her medical condition due to the demands of pregnancy. This deterioration may be unpredictable and irretrievable if it occurs.

Most kids in foster care aren’t up for adoption either because the point of foster care isn’t adoption, it’s giving the child a place to stay while their parents earns back custody.

I still believe abortion should be outlawed, but I have been thinking about holding the rapist accountable for the abortion. Possibly letting the woman go free, if she has done nothing wrong (like fail to report on time when it was possible to avoid pregnancy etc.)

The question I am trying to answer is: whose hands are the blood on? Obviously the woman made the choice to abort it, but since she was not responsible in bringing the child to that position, I believe rapists should bear the punishment for bringing a human into a state that's fatal.

"When is killing, murder?"," So  let's cut all the red tape in the abortion debate. Let's skip the  debate on why murder is bad. Let's just go to the fundamental question  in the abortion which is when is killing, murder?

There  is consensus that killing for self defense is not murder. Right wing  tend to go more leeway to killing with the stand your ground/castle  doctrine but the principle is self defense.

Prolifers  tend to circlejerk about how this is the only exception they will  tolerate in terms of killing but a significant minority of Right wing  support killing in defense of property. In fact there are laws in place  in Texas to justify killing to protect property at night. Right wing  justifies killing in terms of civilian casualties in the drone strikes,  killing in terms of border security, killing in terms of law and order  for law enforcement. Killing in terms of death penalty. All these killings are justified and tolerated in modern society.

If you oppose  killing of fetus in abortion that is fine and we have reached a moral impasse. But differentiation of killing/murder is a debate society needs  to have. The harm of unplanned pregnancies on society and the loss of  sexual autonomy of women necessitates this discussion. 

So get off your moral high horse about knowing all the answers about killing and murder. Even in the prolife camp there is a lot of people who will tolerate a lot of killing that are not fetuses.",t2_i6uy5jra,1645414860,prolife

Post abortion healing,I’ve had 2 abortions and went through 3 different Bible studies to deal with post abortion healing and still struggle with emotions some days but I really want to help other women with their post abortion healing journeys like even just one person bc I know how it feels to feel completely worthless and constantly depressed/ suicidal bc of a choice I made when I was 18 and 19 and no one deserves to go through that or go through that alone and I’m pretty new to Christianity so I feel like I wouldn’t be able to help anyone yet without knowing much of the gospel/ still being nervous telling my story but I would love to help other women some day ughhh I just feel like everyone is so quick to be political and hateful but we really are just heartbroken women too scared to speak up bc of the fear of judgment,t2_a7n8gua9,1645403623,prolife
The only Pro-Choice Argument that makes sense. (to me),"So i feel like the only argument that matters when it comes to abortion is what the government can tell you to do with your body. I agree that the point of conception is the only one that makes sense to declare that the child is alive. Some people will often go to ""you can't kill another human"" but that's not true, you can. Just like the old saying ""you can't shout 'fire' in a crowded theater"", you can... when there's a fire. Similarly, You can kill another human if you are in a position where it is either your life or their's, self defense. Ideally you would want to deescalate without harming the other, but when it comes down to it you are allowed to maim or kill them to prevent your own death. 

Taking this back to abortion: another human is using your body without your consent, regardless if they are your child, do you have a right to withdraw consent from another human using your body? If yes, then abortion has to be alright. I would agree that the current abortion process is pretty gruesome, that if it could be done in a way where the fetus could be extracted without harm to it, it would be ideal, regardless if they die immediately after. Following that, late term abortions where the baby survives should not be killed after the abortion.

Having said all that, I do think that late term abortion is pretty dumb, and i would ideally like it to only happen in the most severe cases, but it is your body still, so i would have to support it. This is the only argument that makes me pro-choice, i feel there are flaws with every other argument, so...

change my mind? I would like to know the best argument against this point, i am also super open to changing my views. I am center, perhaps left leaning libertarian, i support guns, the military, traditional nuclear families, abortion, a free market (mostly, i do have some hold outs), i support people being able to do whatever they want with their own bodies, including tattoos, piercings, smoking, and all drugs, including hard stuff like meth and crack.",t2_1i0x9ix2,1645401141,prolife

"How do you convince a ""technical"" pro-choicer to turn anti-abortion?","I'm technically pro-choice in that I oppose the introduction of any explicit law against abortion to avoid problems like the following:

Women going to jail for miscarriages:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/02/el-salvador-responsible-for-death-of-woman-jailed-after-miscarriage

Women dying from doctors hesitating to operate for fear of prosecution:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/06/poles-march-against-abortion-ban-after-pregnant-womans-death

Among other complications. In short, I don't trust that legislators possess the necessary medical knowledge to competently draft a functional and just abortion law.

That said, I do accept that human life and human rights start at conception. For that reason, I would totally support two explicit laws:

1. A legal or even constitutional recognition that human life and human rights start at conception. I presume that even without an explicit abortion law, tribunals would still create precedents by interpreting and applying this law.

For example, this might lead to court rulings to defund all abortions on demand. It might also force medical tribunals to interpret and apply this law. This might lead to competent medical tribunals more clearly defining when a physician may perform an abortion while still giving the physician the benefit of any reasonable doubt whenever he had reasonable grounds to believe that removing the fetus was medically  necessary, even when he might sometimes have been wrong in hindsight, so as to ensure that a physician can confidently carry out life-saving procedures without undue fear of criminal prosecution for making an honest mistake.

2. Making fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.

I recognize that many zealots will decry the fact that under the first law above, murder would just be too hard to prove to secure many criminal convictions, that throwing a few women in jail for miscarriages or physicians letting women die for fear of criminal prosecution is a reasonable price to pay to ensure the broadest all-encompassing anti-abortion law possible.

Since I recognize that human life starts at conception, but also believe that any abortion policy should be moderate enough to protect women who have miscarriages or physicians who are sincerely just trying to save the mother's life, I believe that the second law above could compensate to deter unplanned pregnancies without introducing an abortion law that is so draconian that it throws women in jail for a miscarriage or lets women die for fear of criminal prosecution.

How do you convince me to go beyond the technical pro-choice position above to just flat out banning abortion without consideration for its legal repercussions on women who have miscarriages or doctors who might need to risk the fetus to save the mother's life?",t2_8md27ufj,1645392824,prolife

“My girlfriend and I decided if I get her pregnant she’ll have an abortion”

“Fighting against your own rights doesn’t make you attractive to a guy like me”

“Abortion rights affect men too, if abortion is banned men who aren’t ready will be forced to be dads”

DAVID DALEIDEN PRESENTS COURT W/ LETTER FROM OC AG TONY RACKAUCKAS,"A new declaration from former Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas states that his criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood and two commercial businesses found evidence of infanticide, partial-born abortion, and battery committed against abortion patients – not just the sale of tissue. Rackauckas states that David Daleiden filed a criminal complaint against Planned Parenthood and two commercial entities based on the material he recorded, and for which he is now charged with making illegal recordings. Daleiden’s complaint led to an investigation that resulted in the two entities acknowledging their responsibility, closing their businesses and paying a $7.8 million fine. 

The filing is part of Daleiden’s opposition to the State of California’s motions in limine that seek, among other motions, to suppress Rackauckas’s testimony at Daleiden’s trial for seven criminal charges of making so-called illegal recordings. Daleiden’s filing points out that the applicable California law creates an exception for recordings intended to show the commission of violent crimes, and that the Rackauckas declaration and testimony should be exculpatory to the charges against Daleiden.

Is Anybody Else Getting Tired Of The Socialist/Communist Cornering Argument?,"This is a counter argument I keep seeing from pro choicers. That pro life folks don't care about people after they're born because we don't support socialist policies.

Why do they view life in such a binary way? So anyone who doesn't support socialism doesn't have empathy for anyone? They act as if socialism is the default standard of society, and anyone who opposes it is removing something natural from society itself. Like removing oxygen or cutting down all the trees.

It's not a standard. Society can branch out in multiple ways. It is not hypocritical for someone to be pro life and pro free market.

Ever since getting into the abortion debate I have a lot more respect and understanding for Vegan extremists.,"Most of you have probably heard of those vegans that are extremists and always go on about how ""meat is literally murder"" and protest obnoxiously outside of butcher's or who throw red paint on fur coats.

I remember seeing videos of these people and reactions to them on YouTube channel's like ""Isaac Butterfield"" etc. Back in the day you'd just laugh at them and think ""what idiots"" or ""why would anyone do this, if they wanna be vegan why don't they just do that privately and let others do what they want"".

But after getting into the abortion debate, I've reconsidered my position on these people and their actions.

Why? Well, it comes down to when I interacted with pro-choicers and asked them ""What's the motive for being pro-life?"" Now I often ask this question in order to see if pro-choice people understand that we're pro-life because **that's the appropriate reaction given what we believe**, that if you've come to the conclusion that **life begins at conception** then of course you're going to be against abortion being legal. But to my surprise many pro-choicers could never understand this, they'd always make up some kind of ridiculous motive such as ""you just want to control women"" or ""you want to increase the population"" or some other outlandish conspiracy theory to try and pin some selfish motive on us.

I'm sure many of you have also heard the infamous pro-choice ""argument"" of ""Why can't you just be pro-life for yourself?"", ignoring the fact that if you **genuinely believe life begins at conception**, then you can't be ""personally against murder"".

&amp;#x200B;

So with this understanding of just how easily one side can completely ignore or misrepresent the motives of a movement. I pondered those same extreme vegans once again, and I came to the conclusion that if you **genuinely believe animal life is equal to or near equal to human life in value** the it follows that the correct reaction is to be completely opposed to anyone eating meat, that you should view the consumption of meat in the same way we'd view something like the holocaust.

Now I want to remind everyone that **I don't believe this**, I believe the view that animal life is in anyway close to human life in value is wrong but I can still understand that if someone has sincerely come to that conclusion then wanting to ban meat for everyone, or protesting outside of butchers and deli's or whatever shenanigans these people get up to is a **reasonable response**, **given what they believe**. In the same way that a pro-lifer who believes life begins at conception can't reasonably be ""personally pro-life"" a vegan who **genuinely believes animal life = human life** can't reasonably be ""personally vegan"" and should try their best to push that on others and to pass legislation that decreases or bans the consumption of meat/animal products.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this applies to many debates and movements, 99 times out of 100 people don't do things ""for the sake of being evil"", motives tend to be more nuanced than ""they just hate them cause"", a good litmus test for understanding any issue is to always understand where people are coming from so in most cases you can confidently say something along the lines of ""while I disagree with certain premises, I can understand why someone who believes this would act in this way or want X,Y,Z.""

&amp;#x200B;

The response: Well, if you're against abortion, don't get one.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they really think they are owning me?  Consider analogous arguments:

&amp;#x200B;

Position: I don't think people should cheat on their taxes.  

Response: Then don't cheat on your taxes.  But if Trump and other players want to cheat, that's between them and the IRS.

&amp;#x200B;

Position: I think dumping hazardous waste into drinking water should be illegal

Response: Then don't dump hazardous waste into drinking water.  But others must have the choice to dump hazardous waste wherever they want without busybody scolds like you trying to stop them.

&amp;#x200B;

People who respond this way might think they are cleverly shutting down the argument with a slam dunk, but they clearly haven't thought about it.",t2_epnrc8hq,1644972544,prolife

"Whether you're PC or PL, the abortion debate is entirely about homicide law","Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice, this is a debate about whether homicide laws should make it illegal to kill someone who is under your care, is innocent of crime, and is not threatening your life.

Pro-choicers think it should be legal to kill someone who is innocent of crime because the offspring is inside their mother, and pro-lifers think it should be illegal even considering that the offspring is inside their mother, unless the mother's life is threatened.

Therefore, the abortion debate is not a debate ""about"" bodily autonomy or bodily rights or gendered rights, rather those things are arguments pro-choicers use in this debate about what homicide law ought to be.

While bodily autonomy is the argument that pro-choicers use to argue against changes to homicide law, it's not what the debate is about, the debate is about whether laws should change or not.",t2_1468jo,1644965097,prolife

Are fetuses parasites?,"I mean, by the strict scientific definition of parasite, the fetus is not. But when PCers make that argument, it can also be interpreted as a metaphor. Considering that pregnancy takes a huge toll on a woman’s body, from the woman’s perspective, it could might as well metaphorically be a parasite. 

Now, depending on context and which exceptions you have, saying a fetus is a parasite from the PC side is an appeal to emotion, and does not allow the logical responsibility for you not to kill the offspring inside. 

But there is a thing I am wondering, when a pro choicer says this, how should you respond in an effective manner and is actually useful in changing minds?

Birth Control and Abortifacient,"Recently, Students For Life posted a video on TikTok saying that hormonal contraception can act as an abortifacient. Of course, I’m sure many pro lifers would support birth control and any means that would prevent conception. Just not after conception, because otherwise, it is an abortion. 

The issue is about the ethics of course. When I tagged the progressive prolifer @kayfellowz in the comment section. She says that hormonal birth control being an abortifacient is a rare risk just like how pregnant women taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or antibiotics. And thus is okay and different from an intentional elective abortion. 

I came up with my own explanation in using the “purpose argument”. The main goal of hormonal birth control is to prevent conception, and not causing an abortion even though it can, rarely. Just like how the main purpose of a car is to get to point A to point B, and not causing a car crash even though it can, rarely. But the argument kind of gets muddied after you factor in sex and its purpose. You know what I mean?

This should be an issue being more talked about in pro life circles. Do you guys agree with my argument or @kayfellowz on TikTok’s argument? Or do you think birth control should also be restricted as with abortion?",t2_518sdac7,1644624772,prolife

I was trying to explain abortion to my 9 year old daughter and she asked a simple question ""why can't these girls just give their babies to people who want them"".

Hardly an original thought but it made me think, are there any such groups that advocate for this and provide compassion, guidance, financial support and counselling to help potential mothers keep their baby until birth and then give it up for adoption?

If this could be de-stigmatized and if accidental young mothers could be paid in a similar way as surrogate mothers are paid would this lead to less people choosing abortion?

Maybe there is a service like this in Canada already. If there is can you tell me, I would like to see if I can support this type of initiative.

Also, they make it sound like all women who have them die. The current abortion rate is 22%. Do they really think 22% of women would not only do something that’s against the law but something that would absolutely end in death?

Would you still consider it murder if it was removed alive?,"I’m pro choice but I do have a genuine question I’ve been thinking about recently and I wanted to ask someone who was pro life. Thought this would be a good place to ask. 

Generally I see people who are pro life say that women have a right to bodily autonomy, until there’s another life involved. That embryo/fetus is a separate person and has a right to life as anyone, and having an abortion is murder because the fetus is it’s own person. If the fetus is it’s own individual, doesn’t the mother have a right to bodily autonomy from the fetus? She doesn’t owe her body to another person? If let say, the fetus was removed but was still alive for the extraction, like a C section. Would that still be considered an abortion and/or murder? Obviously the fetus will still most likely die. 

What I’m hung up on is if no person has a right to use your body for their own personal gain without your consent, why does a fetus? If the fetus was removed alive because it doesn’t have a right to your body, but ending up dying because it can’t live without your body. Doesn’t that fit within your parameters of why you consider abortion wrong? If they aren’t actively killing the fetus but the fetus died as a result of not being able to live outside of the mothers body, would that change anything? Or does the fetus have to have the capability of living outside of the womb before the mother can declare sovereignty from the fetus/baby?

A comparison I want to make to outline my point is if there was a new born baby, 3-6 months, that for one reason or another was only able to consume and digest the milk from the mother that gave birth to them. No other treatment or alternative solutions available, this baby will die without this mothers milk. Does the mother have no choice but to give up her milk, or does she have a right to say no?

Being Pro or Anti Contraception are BOTH valid positions for Pro-lifers,"I'm going to be mainly defending people who are anti-contraception since most people already know and understand the reasons for why people are pro-life and pro-contraception. I also wanna say that I'm simply giving a defence for this position and if you want to be pro-life and pro-contraception than that's **perfectly fine and valid also**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, when people are Anti-Contraception and Pro-life the reasons are somewhat related but actually quite different. To say something like ""Catholics are anti-contraception because they think sperm is a life"" is a **strawman**. Most people, at least those that know what they're talking about are against not against contraception because they believe that sperm are living humans.

&amp;#x200B;

So why are they then? Well to put it simply it's due to the fact that contraception **divorces** the **unitive/pleasure** part (secondary purpose) of the sex act with the **procreative** part (primary purpose) of the sex act. When this is done pregnancy stops being the main result of sex and becomes an ""unintended consequence"" or a ""mistake"" when in reality becoming pregnant after having sex is literally the point of the act.

Essentially, think of it akin to someone who eats a buffet of food for the **pleasure** of eating but then throws it all up later in order to not gain weight. They've essentially **divorced** the **nutritional** part of eating (the primary purpose) from the **pleasure** of eating (secondary purpose) in order to receive the pleasure of the secondary purpose **only**. In doing so the person has made the primary purpose of eating, a.k.a to receive nutrients an ""unintended consequence"" or a ""negative"". This is why even putting aside the health detriments of throwing up your food, we'd still consider someone doing such a thing as having a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing with sex is also that the consequences of such a divorce and deviation of it's intended purpose has far reaching consequences that should be considered especially in relation to the abortion debate.

When you promote the idea that ""sex is primarily or only used for pleasure"" you're promoting the idea that pregnancy is a negative and that the sex act must have been faulty or gone wrong if it results in pregnancy. Which leads itself to the idea that pregnancy is a mistake that needs to be ""fixed"" such as through **abortion**. Hence why according to the Guttmacher Institute, ""[Half of US abortion patients report using contraception in the month they became pregnant](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2018/about-half-us-abortion-patients-report-using-contraception-month-they-became)"".

&amp;#x200B;

I once heard of a high school teacher who when he overheard some of his male students talking about having sex simply said to them ""You know you guys are essentially saying you're ready to become fathers"" and how that shocked them. But it's true, when you have sex with someone you are accepting that there is a non zero chance that either you or them will become pregnant, a.k.a sex worked in the way that it's supposed to.

I've also anecdotally experienced this kind of mindset back when I was in school. I remember when some of my friends told me they started having sex, I cautioned them by saying ""Are you sure, what if you get her knocked up?"" and the types of answers I got are these:

""If we have an **accident** we'll get an **abortion**.""

""If we make a **mistake** I'll help her get an **abortion**.""

""Worst case scenario we can just get an **abortion**.""

As you can see most of my old high school buds saw pregnancy as **negative** consequence, a sort of **defect** of having sex. Because they were having sex with the mindset that sex's primary or sole purpose is pleasure, that they should use things to artificially block the other part of sex in order to only have the pleasure part. So what would happened when the ""negative"" result occurred, they would treat it like a negative thing and opt for abortion. Because in their minds they would be **wronged** by having their sex result in pregnancy as that was not what they saw it as being for.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up the anti-contraceptive perspective:

1. Contraception divorces procreation from the pleasure of the sex act.
2. This makes pregnancy a negative and a ""problem"" from sex.
3. This mindset drives the idea that people are entitled to consequence free sex and that they should be allowed to kill others (abortion) in order to remedy a ""wrong"" that has been done to them by becoming pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as I said before I'm merely defending a side that is often ridiculed and strawmaned and showing that there are reasonable arguments and considerations to be taken from their view and position. That their view is not just some archaic fundamentalist one and instead one with more nuance than is often first perceived. As long as you're against **abortion** and desire it to be **outlawed** than we're all allies in this fight either way.",t2_9ev60ea5,1644246067,prolife

Would you carry the baby?,"So I'm going to start with I'm pro-choice. I'm not here to argue, just here with a question.

So, some of you say the man should get rights to determine if the fetus made of his DNA will be aborted. But the man isn't the one carrying the baby, in fact anybody besides the pregnant woman isn't carrying the baby. Nobody else has to go through 9 months of carrying the baby, the physical and emotion stress, pushing a baby out your vagina , OR having major surgery, also sustaining permanent effects on the body, and possible death. 

Did you know childbirth gives a woman stretch marks, loosens her vagina with each birth, permanently changes her vagina looks to 'parous introtouis', can tear all the way back to the anus, stitches in the vagina, fitsulas, can cause uterine, rectal, or bladder prolapse, vaginal wall prolapse, vaginal scarring, causes diastasis recti, weight gain, and permanent sagging skin and breasts. Men don't like women with any of that yet feel the need to force her to carry a baby?

Did you know postpartum whether or not you keep the baby, you get tons of hormonal changes that cause you to get postpartum depression, anxiety, psychosis and sometimes these things lead women to do very bad things. 

So for pro-lifers, if a woman chose to get an abortion and there was an option for you to carry the baby by having it put in your womb and you go pregnancy consisting of physical and mental change &amp; childbirth consisting of vaginal changes, would you do it?

If your a man they're researching male pregnancy:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/uterus-transplants-make-male-pregnancy-possible-2015-11%3famp

Yes, male pregnancy is dangerous and you can die (as can women), and you would have to have a uterus implanted in your body, carry the baby for 9 months and go through all the pregnancy symptoms, risk pregnancy complications and potential death, and deal with potential postpartum psychosis, anxiety, depression, and more. You would also have to go through a major C-section delivery to deliver the baby. Of course if you don't want a c section, I suppose you could take out your penis and get a vagina instead connected to your uterus and go through vaginal labor and changes instead. It is way safer but then you know you have to have a vagina, not to mention a loose one. 

What, you a man don't want to go through that? Why not? If you don't, the fetus will be aborted and your the only one that can save it. What do you mean, you don't want your body to change?

And you a woman, don't want to go through all that for a baby that's not yours or you don't want? 

How is that pro-life? Sounds like pro forced birth

Question about the reckless shooter argument,"Though I lean somewhat pro-choice on abortion for different medical and legal reasons, I still accept that human life starts at conception and, for that reason, do give much thought to how the state can deter unplanned pregnancies in the first place.

With the above in mind, I'm sure that wherever you sit on the pro-life-pro-choice spectrum, if you accept that human life starts at conception, you might have given this subject some thought too.

In another thread, someone suggested that we should make even the simple possession of an abortion pill a criminal offense regardless of whether the one in whose possession it is is pregnant or not. Given how the mere possession of an abortion pill doesn't kill anyone, I presume the rationale was that having such a pill in a woman's possession could tempt her to use it if she should ever get pregnant. In other words, simply having such a pill in her possession could be viewed as an act of criminal recklessness due to the high risk of temptation to take it should she get pregnant whether she is presently pregnant or not.

If I start shooting at empty cans across a busy downtown street with a hunting rifle, I could be charged with criminal recklessness even if no one gets hurt simply due to the high probability that someone could have gotten hurt.

If human life starts at conception, given the high risk and potential consequences to the parents and child of unplanned pregnancy from fornication, and the lack of any medical need to fornicate for any reason, could we not argue that fornication could fall under the legal category of criminal recklessness even if no pregnancy occurs  simply on the grounds that an unreasonable risk had been taken?

For example, if we made fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense , could we not legitimize such a law on the grounds that fornication constitutes an act of criminal recklessness?

After all, how can we rationalize putting a woman in prison for merely possessing an abortion pill even though she might not even be pregnant, while still defending a man's right to give his consent to fornication without any legal consequence to himself?",t2_8md27ufj,1643923742,prolife

The mental gymnastics of the pro-abortion people is utterly insane.,"Over in public freakout they showed a video of an office tasering a pregnant woman twice and killing her unborn child.

The post is full of pro-aborts who are saying it was murder but at the same time talking about how abortion is acceptable. The sheer mental gymnastics to think that abortion is not murder but at the same time want the cop charged with murder is mind boggling. 

It's literal insanity: The baby is not a baby unless you want it, so if you want it if anyone hurts you and it dies they should be charged with murder, but if you decide while they are hurting you you don't want the child anymore it's suddenly acceptable to murder it.

""Let Me Be Me""

- N. R. Monarez -

Here I am
tiny and meek
How old am I?
Only four weeks
I am small
just a seed
growing within,
I cannot speak,
but my heart -
if you listen -
begins to beat!
Days have passed
blood is flowing
my toes and fingers
now showing.
Your sweet voice
I do cherish,
Mother,
I beg of you,
let me not perish.
What have I done
that you grieve?
That gloved hand,
hand of a thief!
Does he not know
that I have a face,
that I am not
a waste of space?
Mama, did he forget
that I can hear too,
who will protect
both me and you?
I hear your heart
it beats with mine
in this womb so dark
and with all of mankind.
All I want
is to be free
I am a human
Let me be me!",t2_45ni6k8t,1643665847,prolife

Abortion Devalues Women,"One thing that has been revealed to me while examining the debate between abortionists and normally adjusted people is how damaging abortion is not only to the baby and mother but to women in general. The hard focus on unrestricted abortion rights is terrible, even dangerous, for women, and I don't believe people look beyond the act itself when considering consequences. I believe this applies to everyone involved in this debate at one point or another.

Being an open abortion advocate or abortionist puts women at risk of being used, abused and thrown into the garbage or avoided altogether. Men will either want nothing to do with you based on your past approach to sexual relationships and dating and won't see you as wife material because of your committal to avoiding starting a family at any cost, or will take the opportunity to treat you like a disposable condom because of your penchant to fix your ""errors"" through homicidal intervention thus relieving them of responsibility as well. In the end, you look like someone who values the idea of total sexual freedom with multiple partners over commitment, motherhood, marriage, and family. So in other words, a completely self-centered and pleasure-seeking person. Nobody wants that in a partner.

I'm married now with several children, but I sympathize with younger men and women complaining about the dating scene because it is so fraught with danger and bad deals (abortion, child custody, divorce, false accusations, genital herpes, etc.). Feminist abortionists are not people you want as your children's mothers. If society were filled with loving and joyful mothers, fathers, and children, there is no doubt society would be in a more joyful place. Instead, we have what we have now, where so many broken homes leads to complete degeneracy, crime, and ruined lives. This abortionist mindset dehumanizes not only the baby but the woman herself. I don't like it because I love women and want them to be happy. The abortionist mindset says well let us avoid all of that pain and misery not by changing our behavior but by interceding in the natural consequence of sexual activity. You never have to change or learn or grow and can continue the hedonistic lifestyle that fills you with love and joy. That love and joy that comes from the empowering act of having multiple sexual partners and never a solid, committed relationship.

Pro-lifers want you to have the baby and love it. Pro-lifers want you to have joy. I personally want everyone to have joy in their lives! Abortionists want you to avoid joy and instead seek pleasure. Pleasure simply kills. Look at the opioid epidemic. 

And abortionists argue they ""care"" about women or that pro-lifers hate them? Sorry folks, this argument simply has no legs. I think everyone needs to have that mindset when accused of ""hating women."" ""No, that's total nonsense, and here is why.""",t2_jrnah,1643655830,prolife

Debunking the bodily autonomy argument for abortion,"While ""my body my choice"" is often promoted by people in favor of abortion the reality is that no country on earth has full bodily autonomy. 

The left in particular seem to be in favor of government regulations over healthcare (FDA having to approve new treatments). 

The freedom to reject a medical treatment is not equivalent to the freedom to have any medical treatment you want, especially when some other body would also be affected. In the case of abortion you view the fetus as a separate body entitled to some legal protections. 

Furthermore not even the freedom to reject medical treatments is being respected, there are many cases where government coerce people into having medical treatments (vaccines, psychiatric treatments, etc). 

In many countries young girls are able to consent to contraceptives and abortions while they cannot legally consent to sex, that of course doesn't make logical sense unless the goal is to lower the birth-rate (especially among teens), this might be due to depopulation agenda (a misguided but common sentiment) or the notion that we should prevent people from being born into 'bad' circumstances.",t2_h0zwdwqe,1643618048,prolife

Any Oregon pro lifers know what happened to Liberty Pike?,"She used to be Oregon Right to Life's communications and social media person and I met her at an SFLA convention once. We've been friends on FB with each other for years and I'd noticed that she stopped being as vocal about her pro life work for the past year or so on her personal page and then a few months ago she made a post asking if any of her friends had job leads and said something along the lines of ""if you know what line of work I had previously been working in, I'm looking for something new and not related to it at all."" And then about a week ago I saw she unfriended me. She's been on a personal growth journey for awhile due to an unpleasant upbringing, posting a lot about becoming the best version of herself and unlearning old ways of thinking...etc.

Do pro-choicers actually believe that philosophical personhood justifies legal personhood?,"I have mostly believed that pro-choicers understood the reality that the mystical philosophical concept of ""personhood"" is completely unrelated to the concept of ""legal personhood"".  But I started to wonder, what if they actually believe that ""philosophical personhood"" is what justifies the definition of and how we use the concept of ""legal personhood"" in law?  That would be an ultimate fallacy.

Legal personhood is simply a legal fiction that can be changed with the whim of a lawmaker holding a pen.  Philosophical personhood is a religious concept that should not impact our legal system.

They are two completely unrelated concepts that share the same name of ""personhood"", and it would be a logical error to equivocate them.",t2_1468jo,1643487617,prolife
I'm a little tired of pro-lifers steelmanning pro-choicers.,"Whenever someone posts a ""not your body"" meme, there's always _that guy_ who comes along and says that _ackchyually_, pro-choicers using the ""my body, my choice"" understand that the baby is another body and are instead making a sophisticated, violinist-type argument. Or who insist that pro-choicers are using the words ""human"" or ""alive"" to refer to some sort of nebulous, philosophical notion of ""personhood"".

The thing is... no. That may be the case in academic circles, but in my experience, it's not what most pro-choicers mean. I was permabanned from /r/AskScienceFiction because a single post of mine happened to take for granted that a second-trimester fetus was a biologically distinct organism. Multiple pro-choicers have posted in this subreddit recently trying to argue that every pre-viability baby is biologically part of the mother's body. I've had many pro-choicers try to tell me that calling a fetus ""alive"" or ""human"" is _biologically_ false.

There's a significant portion (if not the majority) of pro-choicers who base their logic in blatant scientific inaccuracies, and we need to be able to acknowledge those people and correct those inaccuracies instead of just always assuming that they couldn't _possibly_ be _that_ miserably misinformed.",t2_457pe,1643485407,prolife

What determine morality?,"Hello for those of you that may not know I am pro-choice been on this subreddit every now and then and I came here to talk about morality but as the title suggest I wanna ask you guys what you think determine morality!? 

To make it simple on mainly myself but everyone involved, I will go into this assuming that morality is objective! So for me personally I believe that morality is 100% subjective since morality is what you as a person find acceptable and unacceptable. abortion is good example of this because even when it come to people that agree that abortion should either mostly be banned or mostly be legal, there are disagreement on when the cut of point or the exceptions should be for abortion. always allow abortion to be legal, stop abortion after viability, allow exception for rape, incest, children and the mother life, only allow exception for the mother life, never allow exception. Now while I believe that morality is subjective, I do believe that their are standards that we base and shape our morality around. In simpler term I believe that good/bad and right/wrong are 2 different things! 

I can see how this get too confusing and too philosophical so for the sake of this question we will go with the idea that they are the same! good and bad and right and wrong. Now I wanna ask you, what do you think determine what is good or right and what is wrong or bad? If you was to ask me I personally would say the majority is what determine good/right and bad/wrong. People have try to argue with me on this by asking me about slavery and my answer is always the same, slavery was seen as a good thing by the majority during the time period that it was allow! so during their time period slavery would at the very least been morally acceptable but if we go by this time period then no slavery is not morally good or acceptable. There are people who believe morality is determine by law, and I had someone try to argue against me that morality is what is right and wrong  which doesn't help in determining if anything is morally good/right or right/wrong. 

so I wanna hear from you, what do you think determine morality?",t2_4peg9a81,1643476577,prolife

But if you’re gonna bring up the 1-2% of abortions that’s rape, I don’t want to force her to give birth, in a perfect world nobody would be raped, much less get pregnant from rape, but I have to. Want to and have to are not the same thing, and to conflate have to with want to would be a strawman argument. It’s not that I think she should give birth, nobody should be pregnant from rape, it’s that she has to.

Why Adoption as an alternative to Abortion is not a solution,"PREFACE:  
this post is NOT anti-abortion or pro-choice. Rather, it is to open discussion about how adoption is frequently used as an alternative to abortion.  Hopefully, this doesn’t break any rules so a thought-provoking civil discourse may be had and awareness can be spread. 

After 20+ years of studying adoptions and its accompanying relinquishment, I speak for a majority of the relinquished when I say it has become so apparent that there needs to be much more thorough education around this subject, especially in relation to the recent uptick in abortion discussions and adoption being pushed as a simple alternative. 

Relinquishment of offspring is trauma known as a “primal wound” and should never be publicly promoted as a simple alternative to abortion. No matter the adoption situation, the relinquished adoptee can and most likely will suffer some level of mental anguish throughout their entire lives.  

Lack of medical history can be extremely frustrating and even life-threatening.  Lack of family history is embarrassing, especially in an elementary classroom setting when discussing family trees. Lack of native language can be used to shame them.  

PTSD, fear of abandonment, people-pleasing, over-apologizing, depression, anxiety, disassociation, suicidal tendencies, intimacy challenges, eating disorders, non-native cultural issues, and more are prevalent among this group of people.  Failed reunions, avoidance, and/or rejection from one or more biological relatives can be detrimental to the adoptee’s mental health.  

Let’s not forget the fact that so many relinquished babies end up in a perpetual foster system or “age out.” The foster and adoption system is FAR from perfect and needs MAJOR reform. 

Adoptees are also often expected to “be grateful” that they were taken in and cared for (and even shamed if they aren’t) when they never asked to be in this situation in the first place.  

I could go on and on, but few people want to hear the hard truths about it. It’s been romanticized for far too long.  

To learn more and hear the truth from actual adoptees, search for stories about “late discovery adoptees” or “adoptee reclamation” or “adoptee re-culturation” or “the adoption triad” and follow IG accounts such as:  

@adopteetalks  

@adopteespeakcommunity  

@adopteesupport  

Source: was separated from and relinquished by biological mother at birth and again from the foster system into the adoption system. I had an overall positive experience with my adoptive parents, but have suffered from many mental health struggles and personality disorders like most other adoptees. If you think this isn’t the case, you are wildly mistaken.

Terrified to talk to my boyfriend about my past in fear that he will leave me.,"I had an abortion when I was 20. It was a horrible time in my life and I am filled with shame over my carelessness. For the last 6 years I have pushed the painful memories aside, but after dating my boyfriend for a year, it has started to weigh on me. 

We have not spoken about abortion much; I am quiet on the subject if it is ever brought up. He has admitted that he is more against it, and I have shared that I feel it is wrong. What he doesn’t know is that I had an abortion myself when I was 20. No one knows except a close friend and I never intended to tell anyone else. 

I feel this need to share this him because I’m afraid if he knew the truth he wouldn’t love me anymore, and I don’t want to feel like I’m living a lie. I would never have an abortion again, and I never want him to look at me and think of what I did in my past, but I know if I told him he would. If you were in his shoes, would you want to know?

I wish society hadn't abandoned being family focused.,"I’m a 22-year-old woman and it really frustrates me sometimes that these are the times I’m living in. No, the past wasn’t all sunshine and roses, but you know what they had going for them pre-70s? Family-focused living. When my grandma was my age, she had been married to my grandfather for a couple of years and they were planning to have their first child. She would go on to be a stay-at-home mother. Same story from all of their friends, and the rest of my relatives from that era.

You just can’t find many people in it for the long haul nowadays. I’ve yet to meet a man remotely close to my age who is looking for something serious. They all make sure you know right off the bat that they’re here for a good time, not for a long time. At least they're not lying, I guess, but I don't want to go bar-hopping and spend every waking second of every day smoking weed. I want to develop a strong relationship with someone and start a family.

It really is so sad and disheartening that as a whole, society has shifted from being family focused as well. The “pandemic baby” phenomenon angers me more than it probably should because it’s just parents observing what happens if a baby/toddler isn’t shuffled off to daycare and preschool the moment they’re eligible. I get that most families need two incomes today but obviously stay-at-home-parents aren’t really valued or respected anymore either. It’s seen as sitting at home, freeloading, etc.

I suppose I could post this somewhere else but I’ve mentioned some parts of this elsewhere before and everyone is just like, “live for you! Find fulfillment in an education or career or traveling!” And they just don’t get it lol. There’s nothing more beautiful or meaningful than parenthood. I legitimately felt my maternal instinct kick in when I was about 16 and it’s never gone away. It’s a real thing and the most natural thing in the world. I used to be an “I hate kids” person and then something shifted.

Babies &amp; children are so beautiful and exciting. It must be amazing to nurture a young life like that. Anticipate milestones, guide them, bring them up right...there's nothing more meaningful.

It just sucks. To be blunt, I don’t want to be an old mom. My mom was an old mom (had me at 36) and now I’m 22 and most of the family I grew up with is dead, I have no living grandparents. But that’s where I’m at because by the time everyone else my age grows up, I’ll have probably 5 or 6 childbearing years left.",t2_3d921spu,1643348466,prolife

Story

Kid was born to parents who didn’t want him to begin with but because they’re religion forbids abortion I guess they kept him.. no connections at all what so ever, fed, clothed and a roof.. they basicly wanted him out asoon he was old enough and did move out into a friends of a friends place renting the basement,word got around that his parents kicked him out and his parents want him back because they are being shamed for it, but he doesn’t want to and is very happy where he is right meow.

My thoughts they kept him not because they’re pro life but because religion demanded it. Does that still make them pro life even if they didn’t want him?

Pro life or pro choice,"I posted this on both the pro choice and pro life subreddit.

I hope both sides are open to a civil discussion.

I want to hear the arguments of both sides since I am sort of in the middle.
I know it's a very controversial topic with a lot of emotions, so i want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hurt or offend anyone!

My opinion is kinda in the middle right now, I'm pretty sure both sides hate me for my opinion.


Basically, in pro choice, but I agree that an abortion is immoral.


Pretty much every time I hear people discussing this topic, it comes down to if you see a fetus as a baby or a fetus.

But that is not relevant at all, it's just a name that is emotionally loaded.

I myself do see a fetus as a living being, but it's not the same as a living human.


I believe that ending the (potential) life of a fetus is immoral, I don't believe it's murder, but it's still taking the choice away form a potential human.
Often i hear like: it's what is best for the baby, or potential human, from pro choice advocates.

But sorry, that argument is BS.
You can't predict what kinda life the potential baby is gonna live. 
Lots of people grow up in poverty and still have a happy life.
That you think you aren't able to provide a good childhood for the potential baby, doesn't mean it won't have a good childhood. 
It's something you can't know, maybe he will suffer in foster care, maybe he/she will become the next president even though he/she grew up in Forster care.
You can't know, so your argument that you are doing it for the (potential) baby is invalid.

But i totally understand people who would get a abortion.
It's not fair that you have to trough your whole live away just cause you made one mistake.
Being pregnant sucks and if you were to give birth to a child, giving him/her away would be an awful experience.

So I am pro choice. I don't think a woman has to trough away her life for a potential baby.

But it's still a immoral choice, you make that choice not for the potential baby, but for yourself, and it's unfair to pretend otherwise.

But it's totally okay to make a selfish choice.
Everyone makes mistakes, and it's unfair if you have to give up everything just cause of one mistake you made i your life.


So, abortus isn't murder, because a fetus and a human aren't the same.
You can't tell me that if you had to chose to save the live of a fetus or a human child, you would save the life of the fetus..

But in the other hand, you are still preventing the life of a potential human, because you value your life and health above that of the fetus.
So I would say that is still immoral.
I'm not saying it is bad or wrong.

Because humans are selfish and immoral by design, it's okay to make a selfish it immoral decision.

Besides baning abortion won't stop abortion, it will only make it more dangerous.


I know this is a opinion that people on both sides of the spectrum would hate me for.

But i think that the happiness of the nother ways more as the potential life of the fetus.",t2_27ufe9oy,1643329216,prolife

And they just keep making baseless point with explanation i had someone tell me the baby isnt human until the umbilical cord is cut i said ""explain that to me"" and he then repeated ""its not a human unless the umbilical cord is cut"" everytime i asked him to explain as if everything he says is true by default.

Have you guys ever noticed how defensive pro-choicers get when a woman chooses life?,"Popular influencer with an adorable daughter (wren.eleanor on tiktok) shared a sweet video yesterday about how her boyfriend tried to pay for her to have an abortion and how much she loves her daughter.

I swear, half of the comments essentially state ""That's awesome you had the CHOICE to do so. Could you imagine if the government made that CHOICE for you?""

I mean there's no indication that she's pro-life based on *any* past videos, it's just a sweet video about someone from a disadvantaged situation choosing not to kill her daughter.

But the defensiveness and pseudo-attacks are really telling, I think, and they're all too common when women post their stories about turning down abortion.

"Never let the ""attacker"" argument slide.","Perhaps the most common PC argument I see is the claim that abortion is self defense to prevent great bodily harm (GBH) by the mother from the child. This argument presupposes that the child is an ""unprovoked attacker"" and that presupposition needs to be exposed and challenged. The child cannot be justly classified as an attacker, and therefore the categorization of abortion as self-defense cannot be just. Here are several arguments I see often, and the typical response I give:

**""The mother is experiencing GBH, and therefore may use the minimal force to stop it.""**

GBH is *a* requirement for the use of lethal force, but it is not the only requirement. In virtually every jurisdiction, self defense is predicated upon an unprovoked attack or some other criminal action. This extends to castle law and stand-your-ground laws which are also predicated upon criminal acts, such as unlawful entry. In fact, under castle law, you may not use any force against a person who enters your property lawfully and refuses to leave. You must be able to demonstrate culpability of the child in some kind of criminal act in order to legally apply self-defense.

**""You can use lethal force against sleep walkers and people who are mentally ill. They aren't culpable.""**

This is simply untrue, they are still culpable in their acts, but the lack of a violent intent limits their culpability and potentially shields them from prosecution. These people lack mens rea; a ""guilt mind,"" but still have an actus reus; a ""guilty act."" The absence of mens rea is not an absolute defense, as the parties could still be found guilty in charges like negligence or unintentional manslaughter due to the unintentional act. The question here isn't whether the child has mens rea, it is whether the child has actus reus. The absence of a criminal act is an absolute defense to any claim that the child is an unprovoked attacker. 

**""The ZEF implants itself against the mother's will, that is an attack!""**

The biological process of implantation would never meet the standard of an actus reus in law. It is not initiated or controlled by the child on any level which could bear legal culpability. If we lowered the standard such that we could hold the child culpable on this, it would open the door for punishing and holding accountable countless born human beings for so-called biological crimes. Perhaps of most relevance, we would have to hold the mother accountable for facilitating the implantation. The embryo cannot implant without the mother's integrin catching it and facilitating cell adhesion. Every step of pregnancy requires the mother's body to facilitate the process. If we should call implantation a criminal act, we must call the mother an active participant, thus negating the characterization of it as an ""unprovoked attack.""

**""It's crime is existing inside the mother without permission.""**

Existing cannot be called a criminal act or an actus reus for the simple fact that it is not an act. What such an arguement presumes is that in place of a ""wrongful act"" we can punish people for having a ""wrongful existence."" Such a claim is a direct violation of some of the most foundational legal principles of today's world.

**""This has nothing to do about legal culpability!""**

Self defence is inherently a legal argument. If it cannot be defended in legal terms then it cannot be defended. 

-----------------------

I hope some of this can be helpful. I think we are doing our cause an injustice by tacitly accepting the characterization of the unborn child as an attacker, and I really hope that this can help people see the presupposition inherent in these kinds of claims. Please let me know if anything is unclear or can be improved. I believe our community will be most effective when we actively ""sharpen"" each other.",t2_5b5r5ggu,1643301770,prolife

“I didn’t consent to a baby using my body” what do you say back to these guys?,"Hey, so the most recent “pro choice” argument that I’ve been coming across is the argument of consent. 
Part 1: consent to sex I’m not consent to a baby.
 - my answer to this is if you aren’t willing to risk that 1% chance that you are taking even with something like BC or a condom then don’t have sex. And let’s be honest if you combine the BC pill with a condom and pull out before you finish you aren’t getting pregnant. 

Part 2: if a person gets pregnant they don’t content to the baby/ fetus using their body.
- and my though is that another person’s right to life is more important because what you do with your body in that case isn’t just effecting you it is literally life or death for that baby.

 You, a man, have **absolutely no idea** what pregnancy is like. Many women have to become vegetarian while pregnant because the smell, taste, and texture of meat makes them vomit. Many women throw up multiple times a day for even two or all three trimesters of the pregnancy. Many have to pay massive bills for doctor visits. Many women who have previously struggled with eating disorders or body image issues will relapse when seeing themselves gain weight and have changes happen to their bodies. Many women in abusive relationships will have their pregnancy used as a financial and physical ball and chain keeping them in their abusive relationship. Many women will have essential surgeries and treatment denied because of the fact they are pregnant. Many women will be ignored and mistreated by doctors when they have serious medical issues because they are pregnant. Many women develop bladder issues during/after pregnancy. Many women are fired, laid off, or are denied job offers because they are pregnant or planning to be.

Practicalities of enforcing an abortion ban,"I believe that abortion should be permitted if continuing the pregnancy poses significant risks to the mother’s life or physical or mental health. I accept that although most folk on this forum would allow abortion if the mother’s life was in danger, but most do not feel that mental health counts as a reason for abortion. 
Could I ask to what lengths you would think appropriate to preserve the pregnancy in a severely mentally traumatised women. This is someone who may be self-harming, not eating or suicidal. Do you feel hospitalising, sedating, restraining or force feeding someone for the duration of her pregnancy is appropriate . I’m genuinely interested in the answers. It’s not a gotcha question. In this case, I don’t believe there’s any way to continue the pregnancy without treating the mother inhumanely and risking damaging her mental state further.

Passing a law that abortion was only available (and supported) in verified cases of incest or rape and if someone claims that (and later is found to have lied) they would be subject to any punishment that existed for filing a false report.

This would (in my mind) either spur women on to actually report rapes as opposed to not taking the violators to court or force someone to accept punishment for some sort of crimes for murdering their child.

Multiple times I tried to stick up for the pro-life movement and got no support from anyone resulting in defeat and me deleting my posts from the negative commentary claiming I am a man that hates woman and just wants to control their body. Imagine how awesome it would be to actively support each other on a more personal level... I guess I persoanlly just feel like I need more support from more pro-life people.

At least he’s consistent…,"&gt; I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesn’t mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to her or his parents (Singer, “Frequently Asked Questions”).

Do you believe that abortion should be allowed when the life of the mother is at stake?,"Now, let me start off by saying that I know full well how rare this situation is. In fact, it's so extraordinarily rare that it borders on being myth. It's so rare that it's not worth being the basis of any abortion law. It should be treated as an exception, not the rule itself.

Regardless, this is something I've seen come up in abortion debates and I'm sure most of you have as well. So, I want to divide this question up into four hypothetical scenarios and just see where people in this subreddit tend to land on these:

1. It's certain that the mother will die if she gives birth. It's not certain whether the baby will survive the childbirth and it's also uncertain if aborting the child will save the mother. Both are possible though. Should an abortion be allowed?

2. It's certain that the mother will die if she gives birth. The baby will definitely survive if the mother gives birth though. It's uncertain if aborting the child will save the mother but it is possible. Should an abortion be allowed?

3. It's certain that the mother will die if she gives birth. The baby will definitely survive if the mother gives birth. Aborting the baby will definitely save the mother. Should an abortion be allowed?

4. It's uncertain whether the mother will survive giving birth but it seems very likely that she won't survive. The baby will definitely survive if the mother gives birth. Aborting the baby will definitely save the mother. Should an abortion be allowed?",t2_11drap,1642602979,prolife

"The pro-choice obsession with the idea of ""enough time"" shows they're reasoning backwards.","Think of how often you've seen pro-choicers complain that heartbeat bills ""ban abortion before most women know they're pregnant"" and rant that a woman would need to be taking a pregnancy test every week to get an abortion. Or how often you've seen more moderate pro-choicers come up with their time limit for late-term abortions by counting out how much time they think the mother would need to discover her pregnancy and arrange an abortion. Or how often they've justified allowing late-term abortions by saying women need enough time for later-term tests to reveal if the baby has a disability or illness.

On closer reflection, that's... a little weird, isn't it?

How long is a ""reasonable"" length of time for a woman to obtain an abortion and how long it takes before the unborn child has a right to live are two completely different questions with no bearing on each other. If the unborn child becomes a person at some point during pregnancy, that point happens when it happens regardless of how feasible it would be to get an abortion beforehand; personhood isn't just going to wait around until it's convenient to the mother.

I think this is one of the more blatant pieces of evidence that a lot of pro-choicers are actually reasoning backwards from their conclusion. They didn't come to the conclusion that abortion was okay based on some set of moral first principles; they started with the belief that abortion is necessary, and then sought out whatever principles they could use as excuses to justify it. This is also apparent in how often debating with pro-choicers ends up amounting to pointing out the horrifying implications of those principles if applied outside of the abortion debate, only for the pro-choicers to respond by adding on more and more _ad hoc_ exceptions, and exceptions to those exceptions.",t2_457pe,1642544087,prolife

Also if there’s any pro-choicers who can respectfully answer, that’d be great. I can’t think of a non-hostile pro-choice subreddit so figured I’d ask here. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Why is the personhood argument okay with abortion but not okay with other groups of humans, as was done in the past? 

Why argue for bodily autonomy if it’s okay to violate the bodily autonomy of the unborn? 

Why is there justification for abortion due to societal issues, but it’d never be okay to kill born humans over those same issues? 

Also as general debate etiquette, if you don’t like it when pro-lifers call you things you wouldn’t want to be called, why is it so common in pro-choice threads to constantly name-call and insult pro-lifers?

"Spent some time on AbortionDebate, here are my findings","Folks, r/AbortionDebate obviously has some very passionate pro-choice users. What I've noticed...

* They are cool with the PC/PL labels as opposed to media labels ""anti-abortionists""
* They seem to not argue much (or at all) about whether the unborn (or fetus) is a person or alive. They don't bring up the ""parasite"" or ""clump of cells"" too much
* They hammer the BA (bodily authority) argument
* Some claim that abortions are a fundamental human right, not written by man
* A lot of strawman, slippery slope, tu quoque and other fallacies used in attempting to support their claims
* The argument that banning abortions will increase poverty. I found this one interesting because no one could provide any evidence of this


I'd like to comment further on the poverty correlation. I challenge them to find two otherwise very similar countries, where one has legal abortions and in the other an abortion ban. I did my own research and found:

* Ireland - abortion ban. Compared it to Sweden (legal abortions) where population/GDP/poverty are all proportional. Can't compare to Norway because they are petrol rich
* Romania - abortion ban. Compared to Poland (abortion banned in most cases) and Hungary (abortions legal). All in Eastern Europe. GDP and poverty also proportional to populations


Just thought I'd update this sub. They seem to want to debate hard but the PCrs hold onto very flawed arguments which is truly disturbing for a debate sub.

That said, I've seen some PL articles online that don't reference sources, claim whatever they want, or even reference sources and claim the contrary just to support PL. This is a problem. Untruthful content on pro-life only hurt us, as we can't quote them when discussing the topic with PCrs. It's one heck of a job to find sources online that can give us demographic statistics that support our claims.

FROM AN ANONYMOUS POSTER//CYBERSTALKING PRO ABORT,"To the so-called “pro choice” chumps who slashed my husband’s car tires in El Paso this weekend:

First off, I’d like to state that those tires were old and we were going to get new ones anyway. They weren’t any good anymore. I know you’re mad that I defended women and their children in the womb, and I want you to know I will NEVER stop speaking up and giving aid to women in need but I wanted to tell you that your petty and childish attempt at revenge over a social media comment was absolutely a BLESSING in disguise for my family AND for another family as well. You really should have just blocked us if you had an issue with our opinions, you never should have said anything the way you had because you made yourselves mad instead.

We got free tires. Someone hooked it up and I didn’t have to pay a penny. We also have security cameras installed now. In fact, the complex manager is installing cameras all over the buildings and parking lots. I won’t say how many or where, but just know there are also people who stay up late in my neighborhood and I’ve got a friend who is voluntarily doing security at random. Our friendships have deepened. We’ve become more like family now. You probably assumed that slashing three of my four tires was going to prevent my insurance from covering it. LOL. I’ve got friends in all places. A good friend of mine wired us a LOT of cash and it all worked out. I ended up giving those old tires to a man who makes upcycled playground equipment for kids in Juarez. Now they’ll have some new swings or something to climb on. What’s more, people kept blessing us with money. I wake up the next day with a fat bank account and I didn’t even ask for donations, and yet, I received them anyway. You know what I did with all that extra money, honey? I turned around and met others’ needs accordingly. Nothing feels better than being replenished and still having more than enough to give to others in their time of need, and I turned your asinine behavior into MY benefit.

The other thing I’d like you to know is that you cannot call yourself pro-woman when you’re trying to destroy other women for not adhering to your opinion. If you truly believe in choice then you have to admit and accept that there are women who don’t and won’t stand for abortion. It seems you’re upset and in denial that not all women make or support the choice you want for them, which is abortion. We would never slash a post-abortive woman’s tires or do anything else to her even if we disagreed with her. We simply said we believe the fetal human is alive from the get-go in the womb and you started screaming at us about rape victims and forced pregnancies on our daughters, nowhere did I mention forcing girls to be pregnant. Sorry, but you really didn’t understand the conversation. You kind of went off on a tangent there and cyberstalking with malicious intent IS a crime that can land you in jail.

I don’t know if you or your buddies read the Bible or not but there is a verse that says that vengeance belongs to God. So don’t worry, I have no intention of visiting your homes, jobs or your schools or repaying you for your outburst. Time is the one thing there is plenty of and yet you can’t get any of it back, so I’m not going to waste my time looking to bother you. Instead, I want you to know that I have forgiven you and still pray for you either way. I don’t LIKE you, I think you’re a behaving like a pack of salty punks but I still pray for you. Perhaps one day, when you mature, you’ll see that trying to hurt people only results in you wasting your energy and revealing your weaknesses. You’re all much younger than I am in age so there is still hope for you but the choice will be up to you. I pray you make the right choice one day and learn to live and appreciate the meaning of the only life you’ll ever have on this Earth. Stop wasting it.

Sincerely,
A woman who is unstoppable",t2_45ni6k8t,1642405421,prolife

Why the Back Alley Argument doesn’t work,"PCers keep saying that if abortion is successfully banned, mothers will die from dangerous back-alley abortions. Here’s why that won’t stop us.

1. Imagine that a dangerous drug is legal and frequently kills its users. An activist group alerts the public to the danger and advocates for change. The government bans the drug, but some people still illegally manufacture and sell it.  The drug is less common and overall fatalities are rarer, but the criminals who illegally take the drug sometimes die. This is not the fault of the activists who helped ban the drug. This is the fault of the dealers and the criminals who bought it.

2. The pregnant people who illegally get abortions are criminals. Law-abiding citizens are not responsible for the actions of criminal or the repercussions that come from committing that crime. Example: if you get in a car crash while you’re illegally street racing, that is your own fault. The people who make and enforce speed limit laws have no blame here.

3. If something is both illegal and dangerous, the rational choice is not to do it.",t2_66kgbszi,1642386894,prolife

Ultrasound Pictures and Abortion Statistics,"Hi all!

Recently I've come across people who are confused about how I can be pro-life and a woman, especially after giving birth. I don't understand how I could be anything other than pro-life after seeing my child develop with the knowledge that, for much of his existence, it was legal to kill him for any reason at all.

So I decided to assemble my ultrasound photos and pair them with abortion statistics, just to make the contrast even more stark. (Apologies for the photo quality. I am not a photographer.)

The pro-choice crowd likes to point out that a ""negligible"" amount of abortions occur later on in pregnancy. That's true in terms of [percents,](https://imgur.com/a/70N3cLs) but [numbers](https://imgur.com/a/ZNit4Ed) tell a different story (different years due to data availability).

In addition, many people don't realize just how human the unborn are from the start.

1. [6 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/KStvKEQ) At this point, baby is hard to see on an ultrasound--but it's not like he's microscopic. The thing that surprised me most at 6 weeks was his strong, visible heartbeat. It was like the entire middle third was pulsing! I didn't get a picture with the heartbeat recorded at that point, but hearing it was amazing.

Pro-choice people, especially moderate ones, tend to point out that many abortions (around 40%) occur at or before this time. Still, objections to heartbeat bills point out that it's very possible for a woman not to know she's pregnant at this point. I'm someone who was tracking my cycles and trying to conceive, and took the first available doctor appointment to get an ultrasound.

What this means is that **at least 60% of abortions stop a beating heart**--and the percent is likely much higher.

2. [8 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/1loRy4B) At this point, although the photos aren't fantastic, we could see baby's limbs! My husband and I started calling him ""wiggle nugget"" because he was moving like crazy and kind of looked like a chicken nugget.

In the US in 2016, **over 110,000 children** were aborted at or just after this point.

3. [12 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/lRLbuQk) This was the end of the first trimester. These are still two of my favorite ultrasound photos, because we really saw baby's personality coming out. The way he stretched out his arms and legs reminds me of how he flops around in my arms months later. At this point, my midwife thought he would probably be a boy, but still wasn't 100% sure.

Most people wouldn't call themselves pro-choice if they supported abortion bans before this point--and yet the groundwork for anatomy and major organ systems has been clearly laid by now. 

This was still before the end of the 110k ""9-13"" week category, but at the very least, **35,500 children** were aborted after this point in the US in 2016.

4. [15 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/PzC0EXv) I'll admit that he looks a little creepy in this one. He's kind of hiding in the shadows. But he wasn't too shy to let us know for sure that he was a boy! That allowed us to start calling him by the name we had picked out.

Thankfully, *only* 23,900 children in the US were aborted after this point in 2016.

5. [20 weeks:](https://imgur.com/a/87FkSp4) the anatomy scan! This is a big (and nerve-wracking) day. Instead of going to my little midwife office, I went to the hospital where I gave birth, and spent a solid half hour getting pictures of baby's major organs. I got to see doppler footage of blood flowing through the chambers of his heart, through the umbilical cord, and through the placenta. I was upset that they didn't print more pictures of bones and organs, but we did get [this cool spinal cord shot.](https://imgur.com/a/fV6SP0B)

Unfortunately for many, this is when a lot of structural abnormalities are identified. Someone can go in to see pictures of a very wanted baby, and end up deciding to ""terminate for medical reasons"". This decision isn't without controversy, even in the pro-life movement. I personally cannot imagine receiving a fatal diagnosis at this point, after carrying and knowing and feeling my little baby. 

Still, abortion is not the answer; it simply piles tragedy on top of tragedy. [Studies suggest](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2019/01/47802/) that women who carry to term even with a fatal diagnosis or a stillbirth tend to feel less regret than women who terminate for medical reasons.

6. [24 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/sWCTUUc) Look at those little eyes!

Currently, it's not legal to ban abortion before 24 weeks. This is the point when many women who receive fatal diagnoses end up receiving abortions, because additional testing, decision making, and planning can take time.

7. [27 weeks.](https://imgur.com/a/0QkVpxj) By this point, we're nearing the 3rd trimester. I used that bottom photo on a baby shower invite, and someone bought me a frame for the ultrasound photo. It's awesome comparing that profile with baby now at 6 months--same little chin and not as little nose (sorry kid, no way you were getting a dainty nose from dad and me!).

No one is aborting after this point, right?

Even though the statistics aren't broken down any further, here's [a set of abortion stories](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/2019/02/abortion-after-20-weeks-womens-stories.html) where one woman aborted at 28 weeks.

This woman emphasizes:

*I feel like it’s important to share my story because my health wasn’t at risk and because I didn’t have a fetal anomaly — I just needed health care and I sought it out. I remember when I was looking for stories like mine on the internet — anyone who had an abortion later on in their pregnancy, anyone who didn’t have some way to justify it other than they wanted it — and I couldn’t find that anywhere. That broke my heart, and it made me feel isolated and alone and different and wrong.*

In conclusion: how can I be pro-life as a woman who has been pregnant?

The case against abortion,"Facts -
95% of all biologists affirmed the biological view that a human's life begins at fertilization.[1] By the 6th week a fetal heart beat begins.[2] By the end of week 5 and into week 6 the first brain activity begins to occur. Many other movements soon follow–of the limbs (around eight weeks) and fingers (ten weeks), as well as some surprisingly coordinated actions (hiccuping, stretching, yawning, sucking, swallowing, grasping, and thumb-sucking).[3]
Here is what a fetus looks like 15 weeks into a pregnancy. (image link is at [4])

Summary -
The only point at which we can say a human's life begins without being arbitrary is fertilization. It is the fusion of gametes (ovum and sperm) which gives rise to a new and distinct human individual. To point towards any other stage of development is pure guesswork. Throughout human history we have seen that when humans’ lives lack legal protections grave injustices occur. Examples of this are the Atlantic slave trade, the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas, and the Dzungar genocide. This indicates that we must recognize that all human life should be protected for the sake of justice. Therefore human life must have legal protection from fertilization to natural death.

"Be honest, do you guys think that the pro-life party would be against any other terrible thing and actively fight against it if abortion wasn't a concern.","So in order for one to be consider pro-life all you need to do is be against abortion, that is it!

so I am genuinely curious if anther human violation was to happened and abortion was not a concern would the pro-life party or community would fight as hard against it, if abortion was a concern? 

so a good example is human trafficking, I see a bunch of pro-lifers be against human trafficking because one reason is that human trafficking force abortion! so that is a reason why the pro-life party even bring it up! we are against abortion and human trafficking force abortion so we are against human trafficking as well. but if all the human trafficking stop using abortion and just force their victims to give birth regardless if the victim want to or not, since abortion in this example isn't being use anymore and all the human trafficker are forcing their victim to give birth then would the pro-life as whole even care enough to even talk about human trafficking!

Thinking about this logically, I would have to say NO, the pro-life side only really care about stooping abortion! if all human trafficker just stop using abortion and force their victims into giving birth then I will see no reason why the pro-life party would even care to bring it up. human trafficker aren't using abortions anymore so they can't use that to make their point on why abortion is bad if they aren't using abortion! that is my thoughts on the matter what do you think!",t2_4peg9a81,1642362461,prolife

Consent,"As a prochoice person I understand that we disagree about some fundamental things but I am consistently concerned about how many people on this sub view consent. In order to facilitate the argument that because a woman chose to have sex that she has an obligation to carry the pregnancy to term.

Consent isn't an obligation, consent can be revoked at any time. Consent is a thing between two or more people. 

Sex may lead to pregnancy,  if someone's engages on consensual sex, they are taking a risk that they might get pregnant, they accept a risk, they are responsible for the outcome of that decision. But that has no bearing on their consent with regards to the outcome. If a woman does not want to be pregnant then she hasn't consented to being pregnant. Just like I don't consent to getting into a car accident even if I explicitly take that risk when driving. Or rather, consent in those cases is simply non sensical. Since we aren't talking about multiple rational actors.

From the prochoice perspective,  if you don't want something to be happening inside your body then you shouldn't be legally obligated to let it happen. Consent or explicit willingness is necessary. 

From the prolice perspective, you can just say that consent or active willingness simply isn't a requirement. The woman has an obligation, whether she likes it or not. And to be fair this is an accepted concept, we make people do things they don't want to do. Someone running from the police isn't consenting to being arrested, but their consent isn't necessary.

So in conclusion, I realize that we disagree about some fundamental things but there is no reason to espouse such a dangerous definition of consent, one in which consent is obligated, in order to make your point.

Fatribus nostris aspires to inspire all of God's children to selflessly act for others on a day-to-day basis. In addition to extolling chastity as an honest way of life, renouncing sin and committing ourselves to await the sacrament of marriage or life in purity.

It feel impossible to go about my daily life, knowing that half a mile down the road is an abortion mill.

I know that in every single social group I'm apart of, i would be an outcast for mentioning my beliefs.

I think pro-lifers and pro-choicers could meet in the middle if they both supported Social Safety Nets.,"The majority of women who have abortions do so because they fear falling below the poverty line or descending further into poverty and living a life of immense strife, especially if their partner abandons them. 

If society worked to reduce wealth inequality and provided social safety nets to ensure women's stability in these scenarios, then fewer women would seek abortions as they no longer feel as helpless and disadvantaged. Security = lower abortion rates. That means if pro-lifers are really concerned with preventing ""murder"" and saving as many lives as possible, than this policy would be a win for them, even if they still have hang-ups with women who seek abortions for lifestyle reasons....

I posted this idea to a leftist subreddit and I was told that I'm putting the cart before the horse. That pro-lifers don't care about reducing abortion rates. That they are primarily concerned with punishing women for not keeping their legs closed out of wedlock and such. I can't say whether that person  is being descriptive or pre-scriptive of pro-lifers so I'm asking for your input on this.",t2_ayyxkavi,1642154183,prolife

Star Wars Failed Because All Pro-Choicers are Mental,"  

George Lucas read Isaac Isimov and got his idea of a Galactic Empire from the great master. This is also where Lucas got all the robots (Asimov had revolutionized science fiction by making robots benevolent). Asimov had gotten his idea of the Galactic Empire from the Roman Empire. In Asimov’s Foundation Series, galactic civilization had fallen into a Dark Age, and a team of intellectuals had undertaken to preserve all human knowledge in a great Galactic Encyclopedia. This encyclopedia, guided by people who could somewhat predict the future, would shorten the fictitious Dark Age from 30,000 years to only 1,000 years. The Encyclopedia Foundation on Planet Terminus is representative of the Roman Catholic Church which preserved civilization until the Renaissance.

Now, in Lucas’s unnamed Galaxy, there was a Republic that was turned into a great Galactic Empire by Senator Timothy Palpatine (D-Naboo). Obviously, this is a reference to the Roman Republic being turned into a Roman Empire. The Jedi Knights are symbolic of the Catholic Church in a sense.

First Republic, then Empire, then … what?

Collapse. Rome was sacked by barbarians, sending the Empire into a Dark Age. In other words, Planet Coruscant, capital planet of the Galactic Empire, should have been sacked by barbarians from the Outer Rim territories. This would have triggered a breakdown in communication, transportation, and distribution of food, medicine and fuel. There would have been an economic collapse and eventually no way to pay the military. Disease, starvation and plague would have arisen. The lawlessness in the previous movies would not have compared with this Galactic Dark Age.

But Disney seems unaware of the Asimov Dark Age scenario. They don’t know the basic historical allusions of the greatest science fiction epic of all time. Why is that? It is because they are Democrats. They are pro-choice. Kathleen Kennedy, J.J. Abrams and that director who insults his fans are all social justice warriors. They defend Roe vs. Wade, which is the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973. This decision portrays itself as legalizing unconditional abortion in the first three months, in a “trimester scheme”. Roe actually covertly legalized abortion through all nine months of pregnancy under all circumstances in all states and does not allow the public to vote on it. (See “The Roe vs. Wade Deception” on the Human Life Review blog [https://humanlifereview.com/the-roe-v-wade-deception/](https://humanlifereview.com/the-roe-v-wade-deception/). If you think Rey represents women’s empowerment, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWcje7WafgE&amp;t=48s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWcje7WafgE&amp;t=48s) minutes 10-15).

Roe v. Wade didn’t just violate the Constitution; it suspended it, ending our democracy. Since Roe legalized genocide inside women’s bodies in the name of women, it destroyed our civilization and brought about a Dark Age. The false trimester scheme would have been exposed and debunked if we had a functional educational, medical, scientific or journalistic community. We don’t, which illustrates pro-choice institutional insanity. Pro-choice Disney wants the world to remain in the Dark Age, so killed Star Wars.

Science fiction writers are disseminators of information and predictors of the future like the Encyclopedia Foundation people in Asimov. Science fiction has failed us. (Where is the pro-life science fiction?) In the real world, the Encyclopedia Britannica has hired Professor Peter Singer of Princeton to write its article on Ethics.

"Please, hear my suggestion about dealing with dishonest pro-choicers on this sub-reddit.","I think we should stop engaging in conversations with people who can't even agree whether the fetus is a lifeform or not.

I suggest that we ban any pro-choicer who **asserts** that the pregnant woman is carrying a non-living entity. Of course, they should have a fair warning first, but that should be the only one. At the second attempt report and ban them on sight.

Really, this thing shouldn't be a subject of debate anymore. **It is a simple scientific fact that the fetus is a living human organism.** Let's start the conversation from there or else we will run forever in this circle. These are the same people who after they've got their argument debunked they pull another one and another one... And it becomes very clear that they are pro-choice only because they support the ideology, but they have no scientific or logical foundation for their assertions. For example, after I demonstrated that human life begins at conception and they say, '""but they are not viable, so it's okay to abort""*. So which is it: if you think the fetus is not alive then what relevance does viability have? And if you use the viability argument then you now must believe that this entity of which we're speaking of is alive... but in the end they always revert to their original assertion: **it's not alive.**

We should ban them first for being being dishonest in conversations. When we start a conversation we must assume that the other side wants to learn something and is open to new ideas so they must be redirected to the sidebar sources. After they've been educated on the subject and they still **make the assertion** that the fetus is not alive then you know they weren't open to a honest conversation. 

And secondly , when someone comes forward with an idea that's completely insane and has no basis in reality if you do anything but disregard it then you are affirming it. If you, in any way whatsoever take the idea seriously, even if you don't agree with it, if you sit down and say, '“well, I don't really agree, but let's talk about this, let's have this conversation and…”* you've already affirmed it. So complete disregard…. Yes that's exactly the correct attitude to have when you encounter such ideas.",t2_ehb51pjs,1641927724,prolife

It doesn't make sense is because it's not your body. Usually, the saying has been defined as to let women do what they wish with their own body, which I see no problem with.

"why ""my body my choice"" and other pro choice arguments are shit arguments"," 1 Ownership perspective) If you're beating your dog in your backyard (the dog is your property on your home property), I can still call animal protection services on you. The defining criteria are that you may have ownership over the dog, and it is your property, but you don't have to option to take its life. That dog's life was not an option. It's not on the table. (2 Ownership perspective) EVEN IF THAT DOG was put into your backyard you could not kill like unless it will physically harm you. Similarly to a baby/fetus, you cannot kill a child out of convenience unless it presents a probable risk of endangering the mother's life. (3 Terminology fallacy and improper authority) In the 3rd trimester, a baby is viable. The distinguishing terminology between a fetus and baby is that the baby is unborn or born. A c-sect or birth canal isn't what defines life. The criteria of life aren't described by a vagina. (4 biological standpoint) We are presented with the problem of defining at what point does life begins. It is the ""pro-choicer"" burden to differentiate, at which point the child would biologically be considered not alive. (1) All people are clumps of cells regardless of being a fetus/baby or adult. (2) the progression of life isn't the distinguishing point of life as a teen, no more or less alive as an adult. (3) Viability doesn't define life as a toddler isn't viable without parental care. (4) A heartbeat or brain activity doesn't define life because people who have pacemakers or are in comas are alive. (5) in the gross majority of cases, the child is viable  Soooo... AT WHAT POINT CAN YOU TERMINATE A PREGNANCY? In the first few weeks when nerves, heart, or brain activity begin? From a biological standpoint, the most consistent determination of life is conception. When it has its own unique DNA and can have completely separate blood types from the mother etc. (5 The life is too hard perspective) Saying that the child's life wouldn't be good enough if it were in a low-income house or put for adoption creates a social structure on who can have a child, because if XY &amp; Z criteria aren't met, then the child is better left as dead. Income shouldn't distinguish the value of the child's life and determine its worth to live. Planned parenthood was built on the ideology of stopping the poorest or individuals of certain ethnicities from having babies. They are doing the same thing they were in the past but have now labeled themselves as doing it out of compassion. A potential life that would be born into a rich or poor household of circumstance has every equal right to live.  Pro-Life individuals are not trying to take rights away from mothers but to ENSURE the rights of the child; to provide equal opportunity to life to all individuals. AND Pro-Life individuals are Pro-4 choices: Contraception, delivery, adoption, chastity. Pro-Life individuals just don't believe that a woman ever had the right to terminate a child.

I need advice!,"Context: One of my friends thinks she might be pregnant. It was consensual sex without a condom, and we’re seniors in high school. She’s also pretty well off, loving family, money, etc.

She’s been talking about how it’s ‘not a big deal’ and would be ‘easily dealt with’, which really bothers me. She chose to have unprotected sex with her boyfriend, so if she is pregnant, it’s not like there’s the rape excuse (not that it’s an excuse, but you know what I mean). Obviously I want to support her because I know how confused she must be, but I really hate the idea of her killing her child without a second thought. How do I kindly point this out  without it seeming like I’m prioritizing her baby over her? We’re really good friends and I don’t want her to hate me, but her casual attitude about killing her baby is really bothering me.

TLDR: How do I kindly tell my friend (17) that she shouldn’t kill her baby?",t2_bl5bwu6z,1641758446,prolife

Because they try to make it seem like being pregnant is degrading to women and makes her into a mere incubator. They even call fetuses parasites. They claim pregnancy is “traumatic” and deny that women’s bodies are meant for pregnancy and birth. They spread the lie that abortion is safer than childbirth. They try to shut down CPCs (which gives women who might not be able to afford a baby another option than abortion). Some even claim a woman can’t be successful without abortion. A lot of them dog women who put their baby up for adoption and say abortion should replace putting up babies for adoption. They spread the lie that newborns go into foster care instead of being adopted and that all foster kids get abused to fit the narrative. There are some who aren’t like the stuff I listed and are truly pro choice and not pro abortion, but they are a small minority of pro choicers.

An open letter to pro lifers,"Hello, I am what you would call a ""pro choice"" advocate. The goal of this letter is to attempt to change the minds of the ""pro lifers"" whose minds are in fact able to change. I believe that abortion is not immoral because of a lack of proven sentience, fallible moral arguments, and a woman's choice to have a child. 

Firstly, an embryo or fetus of a human being is no more aware of its existence than say a dog or goldfish. They merely are. Of course, i do not advocate for child murder, that would be silly. The difference is that the mother is choosing to not birth the child, while a child murderer is taking a being that is loved and wanted by a family as well as developing consciousness, and taking its life. Ultimately, if you disagree with veganism or support hunting, it would only be logical to also agree with abortion. 

On another note, a common argument against abortion is that it is against their religion, which is often one of abrahamic roots such as judaism, christianity, and islam. Regardless of if you believe in these religions or the separation of church and state for that matter. The abrahamic god doesn't exactly shy away from promoting child murder(See ""Psalm 137:9, for example). In fact, there is a group of verses in which God gives a priest ""bitter water"" that will curse a woman and kill her fetus if she had been unfaithful to her husband, which she was (""Numbers 5:19-24""). Therefore religion is often an invalid argument regardless of its validity. 

My final point is also the most common one, being that a woman has the right to use the tools at her disposal to either accept or deny child birth. This one is more subjective than my last points, so please take that into account. An embryo or fetus is a part of the woman's body, therefore she should have absolute dominion on what happens to it until it is birthed, in which it becomes a separate being. A common argument against this point is that ""She should not have had sex if she did not want a child."" Which is flawed because sex is a pleasant experience that is often sought after regardless of the consequences, one being child birth, which abortion effectively nullifies. 

I hope that I've managed to change some minds with this open letter, and that if not, you learned something new. So to restate my thesis, believe that abortion is not immoral because of lack of sentience in unborn children, hypocritical religious hysterics, and a woman's right to choose.",t2_73v2t1u7,1641601608,prolife
genuine question,"I had an MA. It was the hardest thing i’ve ever had to do. all i’ve felt since is grief and guilt and regret. i can’t take it. but what was I suppose to do? what did you want me to do? genuinely. I’m interested in the prospective of what i should have done and how i should have gone about it. I was on birth control and always careful.

i have no money and i live in a country where the level of child benefit is low and not viable. There are no jobs unless you have a degree. I’m only half way through college. I have no support system, i’m completely alone. we’d have no where to live. both the dad and I have genetically transmittable disabilities/mental illnesses. could i really condemn my child to this? what kind of a life could I have offered? I can’t take care of myself. let alone take care of my baby whilst raising them how they deserved to be raised.

adoption was never an option (it doesn’t really exist here). and after 9 months of bonding, its something I could never have had the heart to do. I know that must sound hypocritical, but i really did love my child. i just knew i couldn’t give them what they needed. I’d do anything to change my circumstances but they are outside of my control. and in my opinion, its not fair to put someone into such a horrible system and leave them to deal with the damage of wondering why their mother gave them up.

Jesuit Priest Justifies Abortion,"


January 6, 2022

Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments on a Jesuit priest who justifies abortion:

At the turn of the century, I got into a big fight with Republicans over the effort of some evangelical congressmen who were trying to stop the nomination of Fr. Daniel Coughlin as the next House Chaplain. They did not hide their animus against a Catholic priest landing the job for the first time in American history. Many notable Catholics also took the side against Coughlin, saying he was too liberal. I had to fight them as well.

The issue for the Catholic League was plain: regardless of Coughlin's views, he was clearly a victim of anti-Catholicism, and that is all that mattered to us. Eventually, I won and he became the first Catholic House Chaplain in 2000. Succeeding him was Fr. Pat Conroy, a Jesuit. He left that post in 2019.

Conroy is back in the news, this time for giving the green light to Catholics to be pro-abortion. Much of what he said in a Washington Post interview on January 5 is uninformed, and some of his comments are simply wrong.

""I want to know the American who thinks government should take away their choice in any area of their life—any area of their life (newspaper's italic).""

That's not hard to do. Simply read the surveys that reveal the support for Covid lockdowns—millions support allowing the government to take away the choices of citizens. Alternatively, go to Princeton or Yale and interview the administrators who are creating a police state environment in the name of combatting the flu.

Princeton issued an edict on December 27. ""Beginning January 8 through mid-February, all undergraduate students who have returned to campus will not be permitted to travel outside of Mercer County or Plainsboro Township for personal reasons, except in extraordinary circumstances."" Yale announced a campus-wide quarantine until February 7, saying students ""may not visit New Haven businesses or eat at local restaurants (even outdoors) except for curbside pickup.""

Conroy says, ""A good Catholic in our system could be saying: Given women in our system have this constitutional right, our task as fellow Christians, or as Catholics, is to make possible for her to optimize her ability to make the choice.""

Let me pose an analogy, using slavery as the object of choice. ""A good Catholic in our system could be saying: Given citizens in our system have this constitutional right [to slavery], our task as fellow Christians, or as Catholics, is to make it possible for them to optimize their ability to make the choice.""

Conroy insists that ""a pro-choice Democrat isn't a pro-abortion person."" Tell that to the pro-abortion protesters who were in the news a few weeks ago holding signs that said, ""I Love Someone Who Had An Abortion.""

Similarly, Conroy says about the woman planning to abort her child, ""she is the one to make her choice; we should not make it for her."" But choice is a verb that has no moral meaning. It only takes on meaning when we know the object of choice. A doctor who chooses to bring life into the world is good man. A doctor who chooses to kill it is not.

Conroy opines that ""Thomas Aquinas says if your conscience says to do something the church says is a sin, you are bound to follow your conscience. That's Thomas Aquinas!""

That is a highly selective reading of Aquinas.

To be sure, Aquinas prized conscience rights, but he did so with the understanding that it must be a well formed conscience. If it were not, then all choices, no matter how murderous, could be countenanced. Which explains why he said, ""If...we consider one action in the moral order, it is impossible for it to be morally both good and evil.""

It is wrong to suggest that Aquinas said that conscience rights override Church teachings. ""The universal Church,"" he said, ""cannot err, since she is governed by the Holy Ghost, Who is the Spirit of truth."" He also said, ""Clearly the person who accepts the Church as an infallible guide will believe whatever the Church teaches.""

Regarding abortion, Aquinas said that abortions are a ""grave sin"" and were not only ""among evil deeds,"" they were ""against nature."" In the 12th century, science had not yet learned that life begins at conception, which is why Aquinas accepted the prevailing view that life begins at some time after fertilization. But that didn't stop him from condemning abortion.

If liberal Catholics regarded abortion to be as morally offensive as racial discrimination—it is actually much worse—they would not strain to justify it. That they continue to do so while feigning an interest in social justice is positively nauseating.

Why is the father leaving their child such a problem for the pro-life party to deal with?,"So what I mean is that the pro-life party hate abortion right and they don't wanna see the child being killed right so wouldn't having a parent leave be better then having the child killed for the pro-life party? So the post that is very popular on this sub right now! 'Men threatens to break up with girlfriend if she keep their child. it is unfortunately more common then we think' I saw how some people are demonizing the men for saying he would leave if his gf agree to keep the pregnancy!.

that is honestly something I don't get about the pro-life party, this side of the abortion debate is the same side that say, that a women is strong enough to be a single mother or will regular tell people to give up their children for adoption, from my point of view is the same thing as abandoning just being more responsible with it, but when a men like him is actually trying to be reasonable and respect the mother wishes to keep the pregnancy by taking himself out of the equation, a lot of you guys wanna attack people like him for not being in the child life. Yes I am defending people like him because he not forcing harming anyone!

People like him are basically saying ' you are pregnant and don't wanna get rid of the baby, cool I gonna bounce see you later' why is that such a problem when your side actively encourage people to give up their child to someone else if those people can't take care of it, themselves or don't want it!",t2_4peg9a81,1641440805,prolife
How do I respond to these two arguments?,"Yesterday, I made a post about an argument that someone made, but I realized that my paraphrasing of the argument was bad. I can't edit the post of a title, so I just deleted the post. Here is the original argument from the person who commented it.

Say you cause a car accident. It's your fault. The victim will die unless they are connected to your circulatory system for a month. Should you be forced to undergo the procedure? Now, sure, most people would feel remorse and voluntarily undergo it. There's nothing wrong with that and one could argue that is even the morally superior route. But should you be *forced*, by the government, to submit to the procedure?

If you argue yes, then you've taken the position that the government owns your body. If the government can dictate what you do with your internal processes (circulatory, lung function, etc.), organs, or other bodily functions and fluids, then the government owns your body. What's to say they can't come back and force you to donate blood, bone marrow, even an organ?

Another argument I found was this; If a building was burning down, and you only had time to save the following: 4 children, or a bank of 1000 fertilized human egg cells. Which would you save?

In support for abortion in the case of Rape and Incest,"I wanted to hear others' thoughts on this issue.

Even though over 99% of abortions are out of convenience, these situations while they are rare, are the most pressing. I know that it is illogical and inconsistent to have this position since a human life is a human life and the child had nothing to do with its conception. Morally, I believe all abortion is wrong.

However, is refusing an abortion to someone who has been raped more wrong than forcing her to keep it? This is what the pro-abortion people should be focusing on since I have heard all sorts of rhetoric on forcing a woman to keep a child but in their discussions, it is with two consenting adults which is crazy. I'm just speaking about what should be lawful, not what is right since they are both immoral choices. My current view is that while both acts are evil, forcing her to carry the child, see her rapist's face and features in her child's face, being constantly reminded of the trauma, and have to feed the child from her body is immoral. Having an abortion is immoral as well but these less than 1% cases are where I would make an exception even though it is still wrong. 

In normal abortion cases, only the child's rights are being infringed. In the rare cases, the mother's rights are not only infringed upon during the heinous act, but also carrying her rapist's child to term even if her rapist has been punished.",t2_4ht41o5b,1641434137,prolife

Help me with this logical issue I am having: pro-life and violence,"First of all, I want to state that I am in no way promote or condone violence or any illegal activity of any kind. I *feel* it is wrong although in my (probably flaw) logical conclusion somehow I conclude the opposite so please bear with me (also English is not my first language).

I assume that most of us here with pro-life position believe unborn babies are innocent humans with rights and abortion is murderous. On the other hand, we do not condone violence to stop it (arson/force for example). However, it's perfectly moral and acceptable to, for example, for me to kill an attempted murderer to save someone else they are actively trying to kill; I may even get praised for it. Why is there a difference here?

The reason that sparks my thinking is the recent fire of a PP (even though arson is unlikely, there are talks about it, and how we should not actually burn down abortion centers). Also if you look at [abolitionism before Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States#John_Brown's_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry):

&gt; Some historians regard Brown as a crazed lunatic, while David S. Reynolds hails him as the man who ""killed slavery, sparked the civil war, and seeded civil rights"".

I understand we may have mixed feeling about this man's action, using violent to free slaves while slavery was still legal, in our modern time we know his action is moral (I think my logic is wrong here, please correct me if I am wrong).

Basic Evidence Against Abortion,"Approximately 60,942,033 abortions have been performed(surgically done) in the United States alone. However, according to lifematterstv.org, there have been over 250 million abortions that have been done chemically since 1973 in the USA alone

Approximately 125,000 abortions are performed every day and 40 to 50 million every year, worldwide, around 1.5 billion since 1980.

According to the Fourteenth Amendment, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction… No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,...without due process of law;...” (paraphrased). This clearly states that no person, which fetuses are even if they are not fully developed, shall be deprived of life without due process of law; meaning unless convicted of the death penalty or other legal matters. The Fifth Amendment also states similar rules including that no person should be deprived of life. Even with this in place, mankind is still fighting for the right for a woman to be able to end the innocent life of an unborn baby.
Definition of abortion according to Merriam Webster Dictionary: ""the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus""
Definition of murder according to justice.gov: ""Section 1751(a) of Title 18 incorporates by reference 18 U.S.C. §§ 1111 and 1112. 18 U.S.C. § 1111 defines murder as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice, and divides it into two degrees. Murder in the first degree is punishable by death. In any case in which the death penalty may be applicable, it is necessary for the United States Attorney to follow the procedures set forth in JM 9-10.000. The Attorney General must authorize the United States Attorney to seek the death penalty in any case. Any other kind of murder is murder in the second degree and is punishable by any term of imprisonment including life.""

According to liveaction.org, lozierinstitute.org, princeton.edu, acpeds.org, as well as many other sources, human life starts at conception. The fetus is not just some fleshy polyp, it is a human being and alive, and thus, should be treated as such under the constitution of the United States of America. Even while in the womb, the baby is alive and fully human and should be treated as under the same jurisdiction as every other citizen in the United States and shall not be deprived of life.

The state of Florida records a reason for every abortion that occurs within its borders every year. In the year 2018 showed that out of the 70,083 abortions that occurred that year, 0.01% of abortions were done for incest, 0.14% done because of rape, 0.27% the mom's life was in danger, 1% the serious fetal abnormality, 1.48% mother's physical health was threatened, 1.67% psychological health, 20% social or economic reasons, and a whopping 75.4% for elective reasons. abort73.com

Response to the Argument that Fetuses are “Parasites”,"According to Oxford Languages, the definition of Parasite is:

par·a·site
/ˈperəˌsīt/
noun
an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.

If you read the definition, two things should stick out. “An organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other’s expense.

Firstly, the fetus is not of another species. It is human from the moment of conception. Secondly, even if it was of another species, it would be closer to a symbiotic relationship (defined below) as the fetus provides fetal stem cells to the mother which help the healing process for the mother of many different ailments or injuries should the mother have them.

Happy New Year here is a long wordy post with data and info on why banning abortion works!,"I’m constantly posting the same links over and over again. I thought it might be useful for some of you who might be newer or wanted to learn more about the debate.

“Banning Abortion will create more people and more problems, poverty etc”

I hear this one a lot from antinatalist types or the classist pro-choice people who thinks a pregnant woman should get an abortion if they are poor. 

The reality is abortion restrictions have no significant impact on birth rates. (Tables 2&amp;3) 
https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/1997/03/effects-economic-conditions-and-access-reproductive-health-services-state

What was found though is wages make a significant impact on birth rates. 

Some of you might be wondering, if abortion is banned/restricted how does that not lead more births?

I have a few links but the not pay walled easy to read one is here https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2015/05/state-abortion-context-and-us-womens-contraceptive-choices-1995-2010

What is found is states with restrictive laws on abortion see higher rates of contraception use. Higher contraception use means less unwanted pregnancies thus less abortions. It isn’t even just seen in the US but also countries like Poland, and other prolife places. 

Levine, Phillips has done a lot of research on this as well the link is pay walled but I’ll share some quotes, “Moreover, research shows that these sorts of restrictions tend to reduce abortions by reducing pregnancies; to the extent that the public favors that type of behavior, this would go in the direction of imposing the restriction.”

An interesting note is also this, “Legalization itself is found to reduce the number of unwanted births. Beyond that, imposing moderate abortion restrictions do not appear to significantly increase unwanted births; abortions and pregnancies decline instead.”

So many quote that legalization reduced unwanted pregnancy. Which was true 50 years ago. But as people are more willing and better able to use contraception it was seen that when restrictions were put back in place there wasn’t a noticeable change. 

In modern times people are using far more contraception than in the past which is why we don’t see an increase in birth rate when contraception is available but abortion bans are put in place.

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02690211.pdf

This naturally leads into “banning abortion doesn’t lower abortion rates” 

We can see from the CDC data that the States with the lowest abortion rates are those with abortion restrictions. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm

What we see in table 2 is that even when you count for state residents who travel out of state for an abortion the overall rates are still lower. Which is explained by the previous link about higher contraceptive use. Unwanted pregnancies are still high among southern states but this is largely due to lack of contraceptive access for teenagers. If contraception is allowed or made more accessible for teenagers you would see lower rates of teenage pregnancy like we see in NY. 

If minors in states with abortion restrictions had access to contraception we would likely see even lower rates of abortion. 

If you have any questions or were interested in other aspects about abortion legislation and it’s affects on abortion rates or maternal health outcomes let me know :). A big mistake you will see many writers do on the subject is take data from countries like Honduras or other impoverished nations and attribute poor health outcomes to abortion restrictions without the proper controls in the data. Additionally these countries do not have contraception access like the US. Contraceptive access is the biggest factor in lowering abortion rates, and decreasing maternal death rates.",t2_z60ei,1641062585,prolife

Can anyone point me to a sound pro-life ministry/organisation? Preferably in the UK?,"So, up until a few months ago I was supporting a pro-life ministry here in the UK. However, I ended up retracting my support after learning that one of their directors alongside another individual had  abducted a child at knifepoint from its foster parent. 

The director and organisation have tried to justify this abduction by claiming it was in fact an attempt to rescue the child from harm, as the child was involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA). Now, I sincerely don't want to downplay the schemes of the adversary lest we be devoured   (1 Peter 5:8), but [SRA claims have a poor reputation of being highly sensational and unsubstantiated](https://www.equip.org/article/the-hard-facts-about-satanic-ritual-abuse/). To me, giving oneself to such conspiracies is the antithesis of being sober-minded. 

Anyways, I'm now looking for an organisation that protects the lives of the defenceless without giving itself over to such irreverent and silly myths (1 Timothy 4:7). Can anyone point me in the right direction?",t2_cizif67y,1640948426,prolife

Honest Discussion About A Top Reason Women Have For Getting Abortions: Their So-Called 'Careers',"Here's a red pill for you: **Feminism failed.** The only place the feminist fantasy exists is in fictional movies and TV shows and in advertising- 100% fake.

8 out of 10 females who go to college only major in the easiest possible majors, liberal arts crap and/or something else equally useless and graduate with useless degrees.

The handful of women who do get real degrees who become doctors, attorneys, engineers are infamous for completely dropping out of said profession within just a few years, so it's all a joke.

Pro-life women. Has abortion made you disappointed in women.,"I am a woman. I remember when I was little and I was having an argument with a boy on which one is better boys or girls. Many of the arguments were stereotypical like men start wars,  men more likely to be violent, etc. One argument I made was that men were more likely the baby ditch then women. Fast forward and I figured out about abortion and was angry.   


Nothing has kicked my pride in women in general more. I think feminists (not the pro-life ones on here)  do a disservice to this country.

"Does brain death contradict ""a living human is a person and must not be killed""?","I'm still pro-life, but hearing this from a pro-choicer made me pause.

Until the 1970s, all organ donations came from people who were dead, no heartbeat. Then came the introduction of *brain death* - now you can take organs out of someone with a beating heart and cause their death. Surely we all accept this.

According to the pro-choicer, that means we accept that in some circumstances, you *may* end an innocent human being's life. Thus, being a person with the right not to be killed isn't just about being biologically alive, but also about having brain activity. (People in temporary comas still have brain activity.) If so, a fetus who has yet to develop brain activity does not yet have the right not to be killed, and a woman's body is the equivalent of the machine keeping it alive which may be unplugged.

What do you think is the issue with this? In practical terms, I don't think this can be truly legislated, because we don't know the cutoff for ""brain activity"" in fetal development. If we did play it safe, it would be so early that pro-choicers would be outraged and think of it as a restriction rather than a justification (see their reaction to the six-week policy). But still, suppose we were absolutely certain there was a pregnancy at one week with no brain activity... What makes ending it wrong in a way that ending a braindead person's life isn't?

My parents decided to abort.,"My parent decided to abort their baby(older than me). They had many reasons such as:

1) the child would have been mentally/physically handicapped (the doc told them so and also advised abortion)

Resources for help with down syndrome,"Today I was browsing a subreddit for pregnant women and someone confessed that they’re terminating their pregnancy because the baby may have Down syndrome. I’m genuinely curious about what resources we can give women who are considering abortion for this reason. I’m talking about help with care of their child through the ages, education, etc. Shaming them out of their decision to abort doesn’t work. 
Are any of you versed or experienced in this area? I’m sure the resources will depend on the country you’re living in, so please share that too. 

Also I just want to add that I find it infuriating that all pro-life comments on this woman’s post were deleted by mods.",t2_d24f06ia,1640489096,prolife

How is viability even a talking point?,"It is scientific fact that life begins at conception. I told this to a pro choice friend and she was blown away. Her response was, “That is subjective, no one knows when life begins. That is why you have to go by when the baby can viably live outside of the mothers womb.”

First off objectively speaking life does begin at conception. Any doctor or biologist confirms this. A unique DNA sequence is created after fertilization. 

But this concept of viability is mind blowing. So you say at 10 weeks a baby can’t survive on its own out of the mother’s body. Therefore it is okay to kill the baby. By that logic a baby could be born and at 2 weeks old be aborted (killed). The baby technically can’t live without the mother. It can’t feed, protect, and nurture itself without intervention. The baby would be dead in no time if left outside on the streets. Obviously pro choice folks would say it is murder to leave a baby to die outside if the mother no longer wants it. But to me that is the same as viability. A baby isn’t viable outside of the mothers womb, care, and love. 

I don’t know if that makes any sense. But I was sitting there after our debate and that clicked to me. Never had thought of it before but sounded logical to me.",t2_4ojpcfaa,1640481858,prolife

In-depth analysis of common pro-abortion data,"Hi guys. I have seen this peer-reviewed Lancet paper cited by a few pro-abortionists, stating *""Abortion rates will actually increase if you make it illegal""*

[This Lancet publication](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930315-6) is commonly cited as evidence of this conclusion. As a doctor (and previously a medical journal vice editor), I thought I would have a proper look into the paper, as it's quite a significant and important pro-abortion claim (with published evidence). It's actually a very good paper, and published in a very high-power journal. So it may seem difficult to argue against. 

Here are my comments and arguments against the paper. Please feel free to correct me, or add your own analysis in addition: 

___


The methods appropriately differentiate between abortion, foetal death, stillbirth and live birth

They differentiated between absolute anti-abortion vs. other circumstances such as maternal risk, rape etc. This is important for me personally, as I am pro-abortion for rape and maternal risk. I'm not an absolutist. 

They did *not* differentiate well between places where legal abortion is accessible versus inaccessible. They used income as a surrogate for this.

___

Unintended pregnancy was modelled, and wasn't an observed number. 

It was modelled using: 

- Those who had contraceptive failure (fair)

- Those who had user failure of contraception (fair)

- Risk of pregnancy in each population group (fair)

- Estimated amount of women with an unmet need for contraception (hmm...)


This last variable could be quite significantly incorrect, depending on their estimations. I would be relatively skeptical of the calculations for home/unmonitored abortion rate in both developing and undeveloped countries, and they are likely to be underestimated as only the 'officially performed' abortions will be recorded in routine data. They say this themselves in the discussion: 

For countries with restrictive abortion, data is unreliable because ""data are relatively sparse and have high UIs in countries
with restrictive laws compared with countries that do not""

For developed countries, data is unreliable because: ""The increasing availability of medication abortion (ie,
misoprostol with or without mifepristone) poses
challenges for measuring abortion incidence in many
countries as use of these drugs occurs both inside and
outside of formal health systems, meaning that it is likely
that abortions are occurring outside of the health sector
that we could not capture.""

Both of these could underestimate the illegal abortion rate in restricted countries - and under-estimate the illegal abortion rate in developed countries. 


___

Some other areas of their modelling seemed a little basic too. This example makes me feel there's a lack of nuance at times.  

&gt; We estimated fetal losses by
gestational age in which there was, on average, one
fetal loss for every ten abortions and one fetal loss
for every five livebirths

___

They differentiated between areas geographically, rather than by quality of healthcare, which may have been better. But we can generally assume Europe, Australia/NZ and North America will be 'developing' countries of relevance - as safe abortion would plasusibly be available to women here. 

They do later stratify by high-, middle- and low-income countries. This is better. Oh, actually, I retract that because they only provide their data for low and middle-income countries.
 


___

Okay then. We can still use Europe and North America as our geographical surrogate group for high-quality healthcare. Although this will include a few places like Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, rural Russia which aren't as 'developed'. 

As a side point, I do wonder why they didn't separate North America from Europe. 

So, the data shows:

- Unintended pregnancy rate was 6.7% in 1994 and 3.5% in 2015, which makes a 47% reduction. 

- Abortion rate in 1994 was 4.6%, and 1.7% in 2015. This is a 63% reduction. 

- The unintended pregnancies that ended in abortion was 69% in 1994, and 49% in 2015 - a 29% reduction

___

I would *safely assume* that availability and quality of medical care for abortion in the US and Europe has only increased over the 1994 to 2015 time period. Therefore, this data would support that with a *better abortion service*, abortion rate declines. 

___ 

The next question is *which part* of the health service has made this improvement? Is it the quality, accessibility, legality, social perception etc. Legality is obviously the one we're trying to isolate in a pro-abortion versus anti-abortion argument. 

So, was abortion generally illegal in 1994 in North America and Europe, or was it was healthcare simply lower quality? If it was legal at both times, then the conclusions would suggest *better availability to medical and social support services* would be the driving factor rather than legal status

So when did abortion become legal?

- USA: 1973
- Canada: 1969
- UK: 1968
- Germany: 1995
- France: 1975
- Spain: 1985
- Italy: 1978
- Norway: 1960
- Poland: 1956


___

Right. So, actually, their data shows that in developed countries, abortion rate declined by 29% between 1994 and 2015. However, this was *not* due to legal status, as only Germany still had illegal abortion in 1994. Everywhere else, it was already legal.

Therefore, I would be forced to conclude that abortion rate declined due to another factor, such as better availability or quality of supportive healthcare, supportive social structure and better statev monetary benefits, etc.

Authors actually say this themselves in the discussion: 

&gt; High-income countries where abortion is broadly legal
had the lowest unintended pregnancy rate, abortion
rate, and proportion of unintended pregnancies ending
in abortion. These
findings could reflect differences in the quality and
capacity of national health systems in low-income and
middle-income countries, and show the need for
additional investment in sexual and reproductive health
care. Research is also needed for obstacles people face
(eg, social and economic obstacles) to exercising their
reproductive autonomy, and the policies and programmes 

___

In conclusion, I don't think the study really proves what they are  looking to prove. I think it actually proves something else important. That if we improve parental planning services, social support and high quality support to pregnant women, we see a decline in abortion. 

In my view, this study actually makes me an advocate *for* funding of maternal support. But *not* an advocate for legality of abortion.

"I need help with my pro life stance…I think I’m sorta leaning to pro choice, yall. (Idk Lol)","Okay first things first…all my life I’ve been very pro life. I believe that life begins at conception and I sometimes get heartbroken when I go on social media like tiktok, Twitter, etc.  and I see women proudly saying they killed their babies. I’m also a Christian. But I’m not pro life because of my religion. I always thought that life was precious even before I fully became a Christian. 

Now that that’s out of the way, here’s my problem.

(This was probably already answered in the forum but I’m gonna ask anyway bc I’m too lazy to scroll.)
I don’t believe in children having children. If a little girl whose 12 years old or under gets pregnant from rape or incest, idk if she should keep it or not. Like on one hand I agree the fetus doesn’t deserved to be punished for the crimes of the father (rape/incest), but on the other hand that pregnant woman is a little girl…a child. Her life is going to change forever. Pregnancy and birth is a very long and painful process for grown adult women so I can’t imagine what it must be like for a child to experience pregnancy and give birth. Vaginally it can be very hard and c-section…just the thought of an underage baby girl being cut open by doctors to take out a baby that she wasn’t ready for and/or didn’t even want( and Ik what y’all are about to say, and YES the thought of a fetus being torn limb to limb/vacuumed/flushed out is also an awful thing but anyways)….if I was under 11 and got pregnant from rape…I don’t know if I would put myself through that situation or God forbid would want my future daughter to go through something like that.. not to mention the fact that because I’m also religious I believe that God has the final say so of who lives and who dies which makes it ten times harder for me to stand firm in my beliefs ….ugh man this is so stressful. what should I do? Are their any videos y’all recommended I watch? Hmmmm 😞
(Also I know there’s gonna be people saying “statistically that doesn’t happen” while that may be true in some sense that doesn’t mean it’s non existent. Underage pregnancy is rare…but it isn’t 0)",t2_7l7tqy8e,1640341277,prolife

"My perspective from someone who is pro-choice, open to respectful discussion.","I want to preface this by saying that I don't think abortion is a good thing, people should try to limit them as much as possible, and in a perfect world people wouldn't get them period.


I am pro-choice because I think abortion is overall a debate over the hierarchy of rights between a woman and a fetus, and when you go deeper into it, those of the woman trump the fetus.


Here is my reasoning in 5 points:


1.) It seems as though rights as we acknowledge and treat them, require a trait that goes beyond simply being alive. There are many names for this trait, but I think the term that properly encapsulates all of them is *personhood.* This encapsulation includes qualities such as perception, sentience, cognitive function, consciousness etc.


2.) Whether or not something is alive does not appear to be a good qualifier for rights, seeing as we treat countless living things as without them. Cockroaches are alive, termites are alive, the list goes on of things alive but without rights in how we ascribe them. It appears to be that we look to personhood, rather than simply being alive, and things like cockroaches have no personhood. 

3.) Let's take animals for example, who seem to have far more personhood than cockroaches, but less than people. We do ascribe rights to animals, you can't murder someone's dog for example, or if you're a meat farm you have to kill your cows humanely. These animals appear to have some degree of rights because they have a degree of personhood. 

4.) We can observe this even within humans. Is it moral that we keep the severely mentally ill in psych wards, against their own will? They can't leave, they eat on schedules, their activities are controlled etc. These people are still acribed rights, but it appears that they have far far less than the rest of the population. Is it moral that parents are like authoritarian governments over their children, controlling much of their life until they're of age? Why do we treat the severely mentally ill and children with less rights than others, they are after all alive and human?


5.) When this is applied to a fetus, who has almost no degree of personhood, I believe that the hierarchy of rights therefore goes to the woman, and her right to not have to be subjected to pregnancy. I don't think it would be okay to just murder a fetus for no reason, but that abortion is permissible because this quality of personhood tips the scales of rights. 


Like I said I'm open to respectful discussion, but overall it seems as though rights and how we intuitively understand them are dependent on the quality of personhood(which a fetus severely lacks), and not so much the quality of just being alive.",t2_1egk3wb5,1640312829,prolife

Our culture is hostile to motherhood,"I have been grieving this for a while and I’d like to share some thoughts. As a young woman in the US, I feel as though pregnancy and motherhood is surrounded by shame. Mothers are set back in the workforce for taking care of their children, childcare expenses are through the roof, and our population is declining. Any woman who has children without being married, or newlywed, struggles financially, socially and mentally. Our mothers and children are severely looked down upon. Pregnancy is the “worst thing” that can happen to a woman in education or just beginning her career. We are afraid and ashamed of motherhood, and we cannot afford motherhood. What went wrong, and how can we fix it? I believe in the moral abhorrence of abortion, but so many women turn to it because of this brutal hostility towards women and children.

My big takeaway from a year as a member of r/abortion,"I'm a believer in hearing what the other side has to say and getting out of my echo chamber. That's why, a year ago, I subscribed to the r/abortion subreddit.

My biggest takeaway is a hard one to fathom. I used to think that pro-choicers didn't understand that an unborn child is alive. Now, I've realized that mothers do know they are killing their children. They talk openly about mourning. They talk about feeling the pangs of regret, even though what they did was ""necessary."" One recent post talked about the shock of seeing her 11-week-old child slip out of her as she scream-cried; it was so painless, she actually wished it hurt more than it did.

I say this to the pro-lifers like me who thought reason, logic, and science--which are on our side--will eventually win this fight. I am disavowed of that notion now. Our enemies are solitude and selfishness: the solitude women feel when faced with the possibility of caring for a child without support, and the selfishness they exhibit when they decide preserving their lifestyle is important enough to justify murder.

"Hypocrite if you do, hypocrite if you don't scenarios pro choicers make","I really hate how pro choicers will make scenarios that are purposely made to make pro lifers look like bad hypocrites. It's a very dishonest and underhanded way to have a discussion.

For example, you're in a burning fertility clinic. There's a 5 year old child in one room and 500 frozen eggs in another. You only have time to save one, which do you pick?

This scenario is so manipulative because of the choices they give you. If you pick the 5 year old this proves you don't actually care about fetuses. If you choose the frozen eggs you don't care about kids once they're born, you're crazy and I don't care what you choose because this scenario is specifically made to make you look bad no matter what choice you make, but they won't say that part out loud.

Another example is the violinist argument. You wake up attached to a famous violinist. He is going to die if you detach from him. You have to stay stuck to him for nine months because that's when he'll wake up. And when you say okay I can stay here for nine months, they move the goalpost to a year then 10 years then they say oh you have to stay attached to him indefinitely or he will die.

If you choose to detach from him then you don't care about life. If you choose to stay connected to him for as long as he needs you to live then that still doesn't change anything. Because pro choice arguments and scenarios aren't made to prove that a fetus is not a person or human, but to try and prove that pro-lifers don't actually care about life, the baby or people.",t2_cz6k6ro2,1640172294,prolife

"I'm not pro-choice, but I'm not pro-life either. The naming of the divide under the current system is inaccurate due to only catching the lion's share of opinion. The variety of opinions on abortion is not captured with a simple binary, so I am asking for some recommendations for subdivisions.","The current debate of abortion overall is framed as ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"", but this is limiting when it comes to non-standard opinions on this debate. As an example, I would be classified as being on the pro-choice side. This is despite the fact that my reasoning is not based on the choice of individuals to get an abortion as an imperative but rather that of sparing a potential a child a negative life under the circumstances they are born in. Basically a pre-emptive mercy killing, with ""killing"" being debateable when talking about a ""person"" as separate from a ""human"". 

I ask the people of this sub to brainstorm a new division for this debate, running parallel to the ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"" divide. There are more than two political parties in America, and there are more than two positions on abortion, in both method and end result.

A recent debate and my thanks to this sub,"I was debating with my friend the idea of the enforced vaccinations and the slogan ""my body, my choice"" and we rabbit-holed into a pro-life/pro-choice argument. 

I asked him, ""where did the *my body, my choice* people go in supporting our bodily autonomy. I'm very much pro-vaccine and pro-science, however I'm not pro-impositions and pro-mandates.

He said, ""exactly. If only pro-lifers were that gung-ho about leaving women alone about their body."" Revealing he's pro-mandates and also pro-choice.

This is where my thanks to you all comes in. 

I told him, ""pro-lifers are very consistent in their beliefs. It's the mischaracterization of our beliefs and of science that derails these topics. We believe these babies are alive and their bodily autonomy is violated."" 

He said ""how many breathes has it taken."" 

I said, ""That's irrelevant. A baby at 9 months still has taken zero breathes. Is it okay to abort it then?""

He said, ""no""

I said, ""Then that's not the limiting principle."" 

There was a whole bunch said, but the cliff notes is every argument and hypothetical point he made kept getting shot down one after another without hesitation. I have confidence from studying these arguments and discussing and reading this sub. All the christians, atheists, agnostics, liberals, conservatives, etc. of this group really rally together to provide such diversity in argument and thought.

Why is it if I wanted to have an abortion and someone said “it’s not what I would have done” they’re infringing on my rights but if I choose to have the baby its open to opinions. Pro choicers should really live  by their words,  apparently choice is only unquestioned if you kill the baby.

I’m in a predicament,"Hello prolife people, I was hoping to get some insight into my situation. I’m F(22) married. I recently found out I am pregnant, about seven weeks. I had a Paraguard that fell out of place, and was therefore ineffective. So this pregnancy is unplanned and very surprising. I’m currently in college (just switched to online) and work from home and wanted to get a degree under my belt and a few years of career before I took this step, however, things obviously didn’t go as planned. I’m prolife. I believe in raising a child or putting it up for adoption.  I told my husband this a long time ago. He wants to have children one day, but not yet. He is pro choice. When I gave him the news he was shocked. He, at first, was supportive and started making changes in our life to support a baby. Since then, he has flip-flopped a couple times. A couple days ago we had an argument in the car. He said he wanted a break from me and I should stay longer with my parents (I’m going for a few days on Christmas). I was hurt by this but understood. He continued by saying that he feels like I’m forcing this on him and he would never do that to me. He said he would hate and resent me for forcing him into this role. He said he has goals in life he wouldn’t be able to accomplish anymore. I told him that if he felt this strongly we should consider finding a nice family for the baby to be adopted into. He said he didn’t want that because he “would regret it in six years” when he’s ready to actually have kids. And he would feel like he’s abandoning it….Then he was saying me making this decision meant that I didn’t care about the relationship and I was going to throw it away because of this. He was angry I would sacrifice our relationship for baby. He said he felt betrayed. I said, “How do you feel betrayed when I told you a long time ago my position on this subject?” He said, “I didn’t think you would actually do it.” …????? He talked divorce as well.  Anyways, it was all pretty upsetting. He’s sleeping on the couch now because he can’t stand to be close to me and when I leave for a few days to be with family (I haven’t told them yet. But they are prolife and very supportive of me) that I may stay weeks, months, until he figures out what to do. I think he’s just having a hard time right now. He’s still processing it all and is scared and generally stresses too much anyways. I would like to think he will come around but I’m at odds. And I want whatever we do to be a joint decision. I’m not an arguer, but if anyone has recommendations for a gentle, loving conversation I can have with him please elaborate. Thanks for reading.

"Why I became Pro Life, my brothers story","A couple of years ago, if you had asked my thoughts on abortion, I would have replied with the usual pro choice reasoning: abortion is a woman's right, a foetus is just a clump of cells, so on and so forth. However, being stuck indoors for so much of the past 2 years have made me reflect on many positions I hold, abortion being one of them. 

The main reason why my viewpoint on abortion shifted so drastically was due to something very personal, although I never thought about what it meant to me until I questioned my reasoning surrounding the abortion debate. Before I was born, my parents had another child, my brother. During his pregnancy there were no concerns raised, and my Mum was told everything was fine. However when he was born they realised he has Trisomy 13, also known as Patau Syndrome. Its a very serious genetic condition where there are 3 copies of every 13th chromosome. Most babies who have it die at birth or within hours. My brother fought for 8 days before passing away, and me being born 2 years later, never got the chance to meet him. 

So how is this relevant to the abortion debate, you may ask. Seeing the impact my brother had on my parents and family is a blessing, even though the pain of loosing a child will never go away. Learning to understand my brothers story made me realise how impactful every child's life is, no matter what situation they are born in. It makes me upset to hear people, who would use pro choice reasoning to justify his murder if my parents had found out he likely wouldn't survive past birth. The very idea that a child is worth less because they may die I find horrific beyond measure. Every child deserves a chance at life, to make a difference, directly or indirectly. I've had someone try to use my experience to justify abortion to me, saying that abortion would have made sure he wouldn't have suffered. It shook me to the core, and while I was already starting to shift my view on abortion, it tipped me over the edge. I think its unbelievably important that everyone hears stories like my brothers, and hopefully it may make them reconsider what makes a life valuable or not. Thank you for reading.",t2_88te407u,1640120351,prolife

I do believe a foetus is a person and I wouldn’t get an abortion because of it. However,"If it has the rights of a human it also has to face the same consequences and be held accountable for its actions the same way a human is. If we use the argument that they are human then they have to abide by laws that humans do, take assault and attempted murder, childbirth is the most painful experience a human go go through (which is never addressed by any pro lifers) and at this moment the human is doing the equivalent of ripping a vagina open and shoving a watermelon in it. Not to mention that many people die in childbirth because of this process. I will say again I do think foetus are humans thus I would not be comfortable getting an abortion. However we cannot say they are humans whilst neglecting the undeniable fact that if they are just as human as us then childbirth is attempted murder/ assault thus making abortion an act of pre meditated self defence. And that in the event that childbirth has a high chance of killing the mother due to medical conditions then getting an abortion is without a shadow of a doubt the right action for them. In conclusion I am not comfortable with abortions and I would not feel any comfort getting one but I do not agree with abortion bans because they prevent women from taking action that could potentially save their lives. I’m not trying to accuse other pro lifers of anything I just am interested in others opinion",t2_gs3jb7g5,1640085474,prolife

So which one is more important?Reducing abortions or “family values”?,"Members of the LGBTQ+ community often reach out to this sub to affirm their support for the pro-life movement. While many on here welcome such individuals with open arms, some still never hesitate to push the baseless, debunked narrative that adopted children are better off with opposite-sex parents. I’m not sure if it’s rooted in a moral superiority complex or religion, but probably both. That said, as a gay man, I believe promoting adoption as the right option yet alienating one of the most adoption-friendly demographics (same-sex married couples) does nothing to help the cause.

I'm considering cutting my sister/mom off for how nonchalant they were about my sister's abortion.,"Ok so my mother told me that my 19 year old sister had her abortion yesterday.  My mother told me several times that she had 4 abortions before having me. She was going to abort me but my dad convinced her that I would grow up and take care of her so she had me. 

My life has been a living hell with abandonment, narcissistic parents and  every type of abuse under the sun. I don't believe that I'd be a good mother so I decided to become child free.

My sister is 19, met a man 7 years younger than her and they have been together for more than 4 years.......I didn't find out about the relationship until she passed the age of consent or else I would have reported it to the cops. My mother married  and left to live abroad when I was 6 so  they are in a whole other country,  that's why I didn't know. 

I spoke to my sister for YEARS to leave th guy as he is abusive and refuses to work. The last conversation I had with her was over an hour to leave him. Her response was "" Well I guess I just have to learn the hard way"". I was disappointed but figured that she at least was having safe sex.

Next thing I know she is pregnant and getting an abortion, ok fine. I called to check on her because I thought she must be devastated after killing her unborn baby. Nope, girl was happy and overjoyed and my mother was too. Come to think of it my mother never expressed any regret or concern or anything really for her 4 abortions. 

I'm angry because although I'm pro-choice and I know I can't dictate how people process things....it came across as though she just went to the dentist to clean her teeth. Like NO regard for human life, plus this was totally unavoidable. 

Her choice, her body but am I being an asshole for not wanting to associate with them?",t2_7efdw21g,1639508985,prolife
The violinist argument for pregnancies that occur after consensual sex is flawed,"Just setting apart for a moment the rape case, I think the violinist argument is flawed. I think it misses the fact that having consensual sex the parents are responsible for the pregnancy. 

Here I'm not trying to argue that the mother is giving her consent to be pregnant; if this was the case, it would be akin to someone initially consenting to help the violinist but then refusing to continue for whatever reason, and in my opinion that's fair. 

However, I would argue that the parents are responsible for the dependency of their fetus's live on the mother, they are the cause of it. Therefore, a much more suitable analogy, in my opinion, would be a mad scientist connecting the violinist to themselves and making him dependent on themselves. I think everyone would argue that it wouldn't be moral in this case to unplug the violinist. I'm aware that here there is something more than mere responsibility, indeed there is intent, but I think responsibility in itself would be enough to not let the mad scientist  unplugging the violinist.",t2_3uc3k1vt,1639506221,prolife

* A little 8-year old girl wandered in and said ""I want an abortion but I am not pregnant"" and the doctor said ""we'll fix that"" and he stole a baby and cut the girl open and put the baby inside her and sewed her shut and then woke the girl up and said ""congratulations it's a healthy six year old boy"" and the girl said ""can I keep him"" and the doctor said no and then backed over her in the parking lot with his brand new Ford Raptor
* They made me sign an agreement promising to stop drinking from the medical waster container (I signed somebody else's name)
* One of the doctors there developed a futuristic ray gun that could make anything he shot have an abortion, even trees, cars or barns
* The receptionist threw nail polish at an elderly man
* The doctor's assistant invented this thing she called ""the silly slide"" and it was a really fun little water slide that connected a woman's vagina to a paper shredder so a newborn baby could briefly ""enjoy the high life""
* The oldest child we aborted was in his late 70s, we didn't even know he was a baby until his wife brought in photos
* The doctors put all sorts of crap up a woman's uterus including a clown nose, bicycle handlebars, a calendar, and an entire Sears retail outlet (before bankruptcy)

I might have to get an abortion but I really don’t want to,"I (20F) am currently in my 2 year of university studying to get my BSc. My parents are paying for my school fees and my mom told me if I ever got pregnant I’ll have to drop out and deal with everything on my own. 
I took a pregnancy test today and it was positive. The thing is, my mom knows I have a boyfriend and I’m currently on birth control since she suggested it. 

I still got pregnant and I’m really scared about what I should do now. I don’t want to tell my parents because I don’t know how they’d react and I really don’t want to drop out of school. I’ve been considering an abortion but I just know it’ll crush me since I’ve dreamed about having a child of my own since I was younger. I’ve also had a fear that when I’m ready, conceiving for me would be hard considering my mom had a such a hard time getting pregnant. Knowing that it’s happened so easily for me and then I have to abort will probably be really mentally draining for me.

Looking for some genuine opposition to my argument,"I'll preface this by saying I am indeed pro-choice, but this is the easiest place for me to try and see the other side of the argument and make sure I'm not in an echo chamber, as pretty much everyone I know is also pro-choice. Just looking for some genuine responses, if something reasonable comes along, my ideas are always open to change.

Here is my main argument for pro-choice, and I readily acknowledge that it applies best to the situation of pregnancy as a result of rape, but could to an extent be seen in case of failed contraception (although I think for most of you this would be considered an accepted risk to sex anyway):

The government picks you out of a crowd one day and says that it is now your responsibility to be a life-support machine for this random dude. You don't know anything about him and for all intents and purposes he's completely innocent. You need to be hooked up to this guy for 9 months, during which time your body may completely deteriorate, and at best will be altered forever. 

I think this sets up laws against abortions in case of rape pretty well. You are not responsible, you now play host to something that will probably ruin your body best case scenario, and there's nothing you can do about it. In my opinion, it is completely okay to say ""hell the fuck no"" and remove the tubes connecting you to this guy, even though he'll for sure die.

Suicide.

Euthanasia.

Abortion.

What if the  woman had some sort of terrible disease that passed on to the child in utero?
 Or if the pregnant woman has a nasty liquor habit- if she stops abruptly there's a chance the baby will die from shock (and possibly her, as well), but if she doesn't stop or has to take a while to taper there's a good chance the child will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome amongst other birth defects.
 What if there was a health complication that could potentially cause death to the pregnant woman if she went through with the pregnancy?

 with the child for the rest of her life even tough she never wanted it? Should she abandon the baby? Should she give it up for foster care? The cost of having an unwanted child is the death of the hopes and dreams and potential life of the woman.

"A rebuttal to an argument a Pro-Choice advocate made, claiming the Constitution protects many unlisted rights' (the ones he listed are in my rebuttal and numbered), so the unlisted rights' also include abortion.","Let’s break this down:

1. Procreation

The Constitution doesn’t speak on sex, since that is a very private matter. It falls under the Fourth Amendment, “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses — against unreasonable searches and seizures.” That is in the Constitution by context and is the current interpretation by the Supreme Court.

2. Interstate Travel

This was decided in Shapiro v. Thompson. This is a right the Court decided to stuff into the Fourteenth Amendment, but is connected to the right to privacy. A vehicle is a person's property, and that property may not be abridged from traveling nor searched without proper warrants or probable cause. See Terry V. Ohio for past precedent. This is a right protected by the Fourth Amendment and applicable to the States’ through the Fourteenth. This right is in the Constitution

3. Voting

The 26th Amendment protects the right to vote. This right is enumerated in the Constitution. Before, voting was seen as a civil duty.

4. Marriage

The Constitution does not list a right to marriage. The word does not grace the page. The framers did not see this as a Constitutional issue, and so, it wasn’t. This is a matter of the States’. The Supreme Court disagrees. See Lawrence v. Texas for precedent.

5. Privacy

The Fourth Amendment has been interpreted to protect privacy, using context and historical proof. In fact, if you wanted, many of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights have an aspect of privacy. The First Amendment protects the “privacy of beliefs”. The Third Amendment protects “privacy of the home against quartering troops”. The Fourth Amendment protects “privacy of the person and possessions against searches”. So on and so forth. See Griswold v. Connecticut for past precedent.

In reality, the framers’ of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to protect Freedmen from persecution by the states. It was not created to make abortion a right of the people. I can see how travel, privacy, and voting might have been in the interest of the Framers’ of both the Fourth &amp; Fourteenth Amendment. I cannot see how Abortion fits into that framework. Abortion is not private, if that’s what you’re arguing. It evolves a physician, service provider, and the life of a human being in the womb.

Thought Experiment,"So I have taken time to better get to know the general perspective here and have found it very intruiging. I can see that there is a conscientious cause, that it's a moral position, and not even scientifically illiterate. I can see there is not ""bigotry"" or ""sadism"" or whatever many of the leftoids like to allege, I can see many principles and I can see that then quite clearly this is not an evil crowd. Now, I want to propose a thought experiment, you'll probably catch what the analogy is, as I have not seen stupidity being prominent in this crowd, but I want to see the reaction, the logic, the position, as I think this is a key topic to debate as I have seen much of the consistency of the positions here. The thought experiment goes like this:

A woman leaves her house to head to work, suddenly, from behind a bush, a man comes from behind, restrains her, and knocks her out with a chloroform towel. She wakes up tied to a railroad by the thighs and legs. A train is coming with a baby on it at full speed. On that train is a detanator, and in her hands is the button to blow that detanator. Now, it is certain here that she cannot untie herself and if the train rolls over it will sever her femurs and femoral arteries. There is a hospital that she can crawl to half a mile away, dragging her flesh through dirt and sand and gravel and grass. There is no guarantee she can make it and of course no one is going to get her a lift there. If she blows up the train she is guaranteed to not have this happen, and eventually she will be untied, of course never the same again. The baby did not will itself to be in the train, nor did the lady on the tracks.  Nobody knows where the train will go.

The question is, should she risk her life, or should she take it, after everything she's been through? Does the principle of double effect apply here or no? Are decent, normal people meant to go through this or do they simply not possess the right to self defense in this circumstance? More or less I am not here to argue, but rather, question your position and learn your answer on what I think is the most prominently controversial aspect.",t2_dtxsh4iq,1638955043,prolife

"""The officer's gun discharged, and someone died"" &amp; ""ending/terminating pregnancy""","The phrase ""terminating a pregnancy"" is hiding the ultimate effect and distracting the reader from the fact that their offspring was killed. It's like when news articles say ""the officer's gun discharged, and someone died"" when if the news was honest it would read ""the officer shot someone with their gun, and they died"".  If pro-choicers were honest, they would say they ended their pregnancy by having their offspring killed and removed, instead of saying they ended pregnancy or terminated their pregnancy.

The fact that they don't say they support ""a woman's right to kill her own offspring"" shows they either don't understand the gravity of the situation, or do understand and are trying to hide from the truth by using soft indirect wording such as ""terminating a pregnancy"".

If they can't argue that a mother has a right to kill her offspring before birth (or maybe even after, because the offspring is still killed either way), then they don't really believe abortion is a right, or they don't fully understand the situation, or they're hiding from the reality of the situation.

Killing others who have not committed a crime against you can't be a right without breaking the concept of rights.  Whether you're an officer or a mother of a born or unborn offspring.  If we don't have a right to not be killed at any age, all of humanity doesn't have a right to not be killed, and without that right, we have none because you can't exercise rights if you're killed by another human.

Time to troll a bit,"Note: Please don't take this post too seriously, and I apologize for calling pro-choicers ""anti-human"" because it's inflammatory, but I was trying to make a reflection of another post and copy its contents reversed for troll humor.

It is very difficult to imagine a more misanthropic position than to deny all of humanity their basic human rights because someone ""made a decision"" they didn't need to and see themselves as more important than other human beings.

It is debasing, dehumanising, and abject.

As such, we still allow anti-human arguments or the users that make them on this subreddit because we're not an echo chamber.

There is no non-bigoted way to argue that all human beings should lose control over their own bodies.

Anti-humans always lie, only lie, never stop lying.  They lie about why women kill their offspring.  They lie about how abortions are performed.  They lie about the effects of abortions and deny that it kills a living human being who is their own offspring.  They lie about fetal development.  They lie about how abortions are funded.  They lie about what a heartbeat is, though a heartbeat doesn't matter, being a living human being such as a human fetus is relevant.  They lie about human beings when they deny that a human fetus is technically by definition a baby, and that one is pernacious, it is designed to be emotionally manipulative.  They lie.

An anti-human must lie and must shield themselves from reason, it is the only way to hold on to a clearly immoral and counterconstructive belief structure.  We do not tolerate those lies here,

The only sane criterion to consider in this argument is whether someone is a living human being.  Personhood and the ability to think and feel are irrelevant to whether it's wrong to kill human beings.

The Non-Religious Case for Life,"Hi all, I've been going back and forth on this discussion for years and I wanted to put forward the arguments I use generally when talking about pro-life vs pro-abortion without any use of reason with regards to religion.

# The Non-Debatable Facts of Pregnancy

- A Zygote is a fertilized egg cell that has distinct human DNA upon its formulation. A Zygote is also a living entity in that it satisfies all the requirements to be considered biological life.

- The same zygote, assuming a perfect and healthy pregnancy, will obviously grow into another human being that itself has moral agency

- Abortion results in the willful termination of human life. A botched abortion or medical-procedure-gone-wrong can obviously result in the death of 2 or more (ex: twins) human lives.

- A Zygote (in the context of human abortion) is a human life in that it satisfies the conditions that it is of the species Homo Sapien and a cellular lifeform.

- The discussion of Abortion is ALWAYS about at when it is permissible to purposefully end human life.

# Positions Held That Must Be Thwarted

- The Right to Life is a prima facie right, and because life is required to exercise other rights and moral agency, this right to be violated ought to have strict and rigorous justification to be overruled, and should be promoted in the default position.

# Common Pro-Choice Arguments

## It's a Woman's Choice

Of course women have the *choice* to perform abortion. What the discussion is around is whether or not abortion is ethical or morally permissible, and if so, under what instances could it be permitted in the strictest way to not cause unethical behavior. Choice in that regard is the ability to simply choose an outcome, it's begging the question and doesn't provide the foundational support that supports an argument by itself.

For example, I can *choose* to shoot someone dead. That doesn't mean that the act of shooting someone dead is justified merely by the fact that choice exists to perform the act or not. For example, it would be unethical to shoot a child dead who was playing on a playground, whereas it would not be unethical to shoot a person dead who is trying to kill you unjustifiably.

## Woman are not financially ready

Although it is disappointing that pregnancies happen every day without planning, by mere ignorance or circumstance does that not alone provide justification for ending human life. The reason this is is that if for example if I have a child and cannot financially provide for it, it doesn't make sense that I should be able to merely end its life because it inconveniences me. It would be absurd to extend this ability to extinguish human life as a nuisance prior to birth even though we know scientifically that at every stage of pregnancy and human development the to-be-born is a distinct and identifiable and unique human being.

## Women Don't Consent to Pregnancy

While it may be true that when women participate in sexual endeavors that they do not desire to have a pregnancy as an outcome, mere consent doesn't dismiss the reality that pregnancy is a side-effect of sexual activity. To put it another way, a reasonable person would not consent to being in a car accident while driving to work, yet it is well understood and known that driving an automobile, like any other activity, carries its known risks, and that by partaking in that activity you consent to understanding risk of adverse or unwanted outcomes.

## Fetuses/Zygotes/Embryos are Parasites

Biologically speaking, this is not true. The conflating of undesirable pregnancy with parasitism biologically is a confusion either willfully or unintentionally of words and their meanings, and then associating a negative connotation straw man by emotional manipulation. A parasite by definition is biologically distinct species that invades a host and actively harms it. Pregnancy for all species would have to be considered parasitism by extension, making the word and its moral effect pointless. Women should just say that they have a pregnancy that they don't consent to instead of playing word games to garner emotional support.

## It's None of Your Business

This has nothing to do with whether or not it's ethical to exterminate human life during pregnancy. Instead, would moral persons not be interested in a person's business if the behavior they partake in is unethical? For example, it would be quite silly for someone to not be interested in the business of a person that was murdering another, or engaging in otherwise immoral behavior. Merely putting a veil over an act doesn't determine if an act is moral or ethical or not, it just changes whether the act is visible to other moral persons that may be interested in said activity's taking place.

## Pregnancy as a Result of Rape/Incest

Generally the strongest arguments I have seen personally are also perhaps the least common ones, the case of terminating life with respect to malicious creation of it. I do think it is important to bring up a potential rebut of this argument as it pertains to the ""Financially Not Ready"" argument on similar avenues. Because the life being terminated in question is not the human that committed the assault, is this life not itself a victim of circumstance or the act itself? Does the value of human life change because that life is created itself as a victim alongside the mother that was victimized. I would argue that the value of life itself doesn't change when the *circumstances* of its creation are different, whether it being accidental, forced, or consensual. The problem however, is that the Pro-Choicer attempts to use the Rape scenario to advance the position of abortion for Non-Rape reasons, which is willfully misleading the discussion.

## Women Have a Right to Their Bodies

Nobody here is arguing that women *do not* have a right to their bodies. What the discussion is over is do women have the right to end human life that is: 1. Innocent (Uncorrupted by evil, malice, or wrongdoing) 2. The most vulnerable. Furthermore, there are multiple things that happen every day in society that could be considered morally justified that do violate the right to ""one's body"". For example, people don't have a right to not be shot and killed if the justification of being shot and killed is useful in the attempts to save innocent life from their actions of malice. It is very clear that zygotes, fetuses, and embryos by their own existence do not constitute undue threats to the mother's body in general.

## Zygotes/Embryos/Fetuses Are Not Alive Nor Have Consciousness

Zygotes and certainly every stage during pregnancy is most certainly alive as they most certainly produce a living human being that pops out of a mother's womb. This is not debatable. When we are talking about consciousness we are talking about stimuli awareness. I will use the argument that even if a person is unconscious and does not feel stimuli (whether it be from an unconscious person or a person that cannot for example feel pain) it doesn't make sense that because a living human cannot feel stimuli that gives us the right to be able to terminate its life. Obviously terminating life results in the total cessation of stimuli awareness, but for example we don't blow the brains out of anyone who is in a coma, we merely disconnect them and allow them to die on their own lack of power.

## The Violinist

The violinist argument is a typical argument about consent of one's body from being used to provide life for another. The story goes that because you didn't consent to a car crash or being hooked up to said violinist to save/prolong their life, it is moral for you to terminate their life. The reality is the situation is that abortion is more than just the willful disconnecting of bodily support from two beings, it is the deliberate intentional act to partake in the guaranteed and willful termination of human life. If abortion were only disconnecting two entities from each other than the argument could go either way, but because abortion guarantees the death, such as with cutting up a fetus and vacuuming it out (Dilation and Evacuation procedure), one must truly ponder the act in which a medical provider will choose to terminate life in a way that is inconsistent with merely disconnecting and allowing life to fight for its own continued survival. You also see this case with regards to late term abortions in which a medical provider will purposefully kill a viable fetus even though a cesarean section procedure could disconnect them and the fetus be placed in a PICU unit. Mere unwanting of human life doesn't allow us the ability to extinguish it. Furthermore, as medical technology advances, it doesn't make sense to allow morality to change because of mere technology or circumstance. If a theoretical technology existed that allowed zygotes to fetuses to be disconnected from mother's to end pregnancy while also allowing them to grow, it would make sense to totally outlaw abortion in which death is purposeful and guaranteed. However, we know through pregnancy that the zygote itself isn't some mystical random person the mother doesn't know, in 99.7%+ cases of abortion, the result in not from rape or incest, so it is question begging from the Pro-Choice position to get someone to accept

## The Right to Avoid Social Responsibility

This argument while not used often, is often rephrased in other arguments such as ""don't consent to pregnancy"" or ""The Violinist"" in which pregnancy and its understanding by society is an obligation and continuation of the human species. We understand perfectly that human children are often helpless and cannot adequately provide for themselves for years after birth, yet we understand that even after birth it would be immoral to purposefully kill them as they are innocent. What exactly does birth codify with rights anyways? We already know that when a Zygote is formed that it is both living and distinct human life, we know this life will transform into an eventual birthed person, and we know that birthing itself is the act in which a baby is ejected from the mother in a physical act to promote partial independence. Does the physical act of birth attach rights to people when life itself is a prima facie right? How exactly does one ""grant"" the right to life when it is the foundational right from which all morality is referenced towards? The Pro-Choice/Abortion side has to answer these questions whereas the Pro-Life argument is simplistic in taking rights at face value for what they are.

# Uncomfortable Realities of Being Pro Choice

## Eugenics, Racism, Homophobia and the Value of Life

Although the Pro-Choice position posits that termination of life is ethical in all regards, by merely asking for the case in which abortion may not be permissible, this chips away at the foundational support of abortion itself. For example, would abortion be permissible if I was a racist white woman who purposefully used abortion on an innocent fetus because I found out it was Black? What about if I was homophobic and found out my Fetus was gay? The Pro-Choicer is left with the uncomfortable situation in which they proclaim acts of racism or homophobia are morally wrong yet by allowing myself the choice to terminate another human being in its most vulnerable state because of racist or homophobia, my actions are now morally permissible. What exactly is the difference between a racist who attacks someone for being black and a racist that kills a fetus for being black? Pro-Choicers would lead you to believe that these moral situations are somehow different yet they couldn't be more similar to the pro-life position that values life. Are we to honestly believe the worth and value of human life is now consistent with what ethnicity the fetus is? That it's permissible to engage in immoral behavior when said fetus is vulnerable in the womb?

## The Beating Drum of Technology

The Pro-Choice position constantly erodes the position of choice when technology itself also advances. One can posit a technologically advanced society that could raise living beings from Zygote to baby, yet this fact alone doesn't change the value of life itself intrinsically. We also have the current technology to provide for life from Zygote to baby, and we've used that technology for hundreds of thousands of years: We call it Pregnancy. What else is a mother to the baby-to-be but the natural technology in which to grow to fruition? We aren't implying that woman are only ""incubators"", but pregnancy itself is technically incubation. Once again the pro-choicer falls to the position of word-play and insult as some mere justification for ending human life, to which the Pro-Lifer can simply rebut ""If my neighbor calls me a bad name is it morally permissible for me to kill them?"". The pro-choicer will continue to cede ground to technology even if we grant that women shouldn't be allowed, as technology constantly extends viability outside of the womb for human life. 50 years ago premature babies often died before 27 weeks, yet tody with PICU technology we have seen the youngest premature baby survive at 20 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby can survive in PICU at 20 weeks, why wouldn't it make sense for medical technology's advancement to further extend this window of viability? Pro-Choice will eventually have to cede the argument entirely once technology can grow a Zygote into a Baby, and agree with the premise that abortion will be immoral as viability is totally contrived and provided.

## Misleading Statistics

Pro-Choicers often give stories about how abortion after rape or incest is some significant portion of abortions provided in the United States. The reality of the situation is that approximately 95% of abortions that are performed are provided for no reason at all or because of economic uncertainty/lack of desire to raise children. Consequently, this means the arguments above about Rape, which I could sympathetically go either way with, don't even apply to the large majority of abortions performed in the US every year.

## New Arguments Presented

## Pro-Life Supports Manslaughter Charges for Miscarriage

Yes and No. The example of manslaughter or negligence being levied against women who have miscarriages is because the miscarriage itself was the result of a willful or negligent act that any reasonable person could assume would terminate or damage a fetus/embryo/zygote during pregnancy. If a person were to have a spontaneous miscarriage and after medical examination found to not be negligent or at fault/cause the miscarriage willfully, no charges ought to be levied against the mother-to-be.

What I find interesting about this argument is that Pro-Choicers obviously support legislation to prosecute mothers with babies suffering from substance abuse/Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, yet in their decision to do so they admit that Zygotes/Embryos/Fetuses have intrinsic value in the womb and the mother should be held responsible for her negligence/malice.

## Abortions Will Still Happen If You Outlaw It

So does murder yet murder is appropriately identified as immoral and prosecuted by societies. The discussion is whether abortion is moral or not, and if abortion is immoral, it should be punished by a just society.

## Abortion is Moral Because Fetuses/Zygotes/Embryos are Not Sentient

But they do develop into humans that *are* sentient. If the Pro-Choicer is to posit that it would be immoral to deny something to someone for some future development such as Climate Change, they admit that future development for the good of a future person is a moral obligation. Why wouldn't it by reason then not extend to a Zygote/Embryo/Fetus? Everyone that is alive is a fully developed Zygote/Embryo/Fetus or, from the perspective of said ZEF, they will eventually become an fully grown human being. It doesn't make sense to have moral obligations for future people and future experiences and future lack of suffering but then to deny the reality of what abortion does to human life that will develop. If we expect parents to have a moral obligation to their children for 18 years, why can't pregnant women have a moral obligation to her child for 9 months?

## Abortion is Moral to Prevent a Life of Suffering

All life experiences suffering, that doesn't give a person the right to willfully terminate innocent, vulnerable human life. The best option is to defer to the person themselves if they desire to live in suffering, it is not ours to make.

## Abortion is Moral to Prevent Foster System Abuse

This is the ""Future Persons"" argument but flipped around, more so ""Future Suffering"". One could argue if anyone could truly with 100% certainty and accuracy predict a life of endless suffering for the to-be-aborted that it could make sense to ethically spare them of a fate. The question to ask in rebut is to what ends can we as current developed persons do to spare and improve conditions of said suffering? And if so, would that be worth it to both protect human life and decrease the suffering it may encounter? Most reasonable people would agree to both.",t2_hbf3laf7,1638914456,prolife
Round two of responding to this guy? Do I just stop? He seems to have such a fundamentally different view of the world and I think it might just be a pointless cause.,"His response is still “-“

If a baby is in a woman's body. And the woman does not like the baby anymore, she revokes her consent to the baby being there. So even if her withdrawal of consent leads to someone's elses death, that is justifiable in your world view?

- Using the minimum force necessary to stop a violation including killing is justified as I believe I explained prior. The opposite would be like allowing a rapist to finish before stopping them.

What if I invited a friend to go sailing on my private ship. I give him consent to enter my property. But a couple miles away from shore i decided to withdraw my consent of him being on my ship because I don't like him anymore, i want him gone. So I push him off in the ocean and he dies. That should be justifiable in your world view

- Property rights are different from body rights. A women is not a boat and the minimum force necessary to remove your friend is to wait til you get to shore.

When you have an abortion you are dodging the re sponsibility of giving birth to the child that is in your body. Responsible does not mean to simply deal with a situation, it means you can be accountable for the situation.

- I'm sorry. But I did give you the meaning.  Let's put it this way. Others don't have to take responsibility the way you personally want just because you dislike how others take responsibility. You are never obligated to gestate against your consent and rights.

You cannot compare a rape and a pregnancy. In the case of rape the consent of the woman is violated by an aggressor. In the case of pregnancy there is no aggressor. Only an innocent child that is created in the act of sex by man and woman.

- Yes you absolutely can compare different body rights violations. There doesn't have to be intent or an "" aggressor"". Her health is still being affected. There's still a violation. If a sleepwalker ends up raping a women they're still violating her rights regardless of intentions.

- I believe I informed you that it is a fetus( not child or baby) as they're born. Also to be innocent you would need to be sentient. Either way creating health risk for her is not innocent.

We know that the main purpose of sex is to procreate. Just as breathing has the purpose of getting oxygen into our bloodstream. That does not mean we can’t use it for other purposes, like inhaling drugs into our lungs. But when we look in nature we can clearly make out the main functions of both sex and breathing.

- We do not know as biology and science do not dictate purpose and I already refuted this prior.

Even if women will still attempt to do illegal abortions. That does not mean we should not ban it. The role of government is not to just simply be pragmatic. It also holds the function of establishing justice.

- Abortion rates don't really change when bans are mandated. But deaths of women increases so it wouldn't be just to ban abortion.

It also holds the function of establishing justice. Why would we support a government which does not even attempt to uphold justice? Why would we even have a government at that point? It is the duty of government to find ways to uphold the fundamental justices that its citizens demand

- The government has the incentive to take care of it's citizens which fetus are not part of. You saying abortion is unjust is just an opinion. Respecting human rights is just.

Banning abortion is not against supporting pregnant women. Banning abortion is against the killing of unborn babies.

- Abortions bans go against equality and human rights.  You have to see the bigger picture and the negative consequences of your actions banning abortions on women. Abortion remains justified homicide even if you dislike terms. Forcing them to have trauma is definitely against women too. Especially when it cannot be fixed in many cases after the violation happens.",t2_4dgd5zc1,1638911173,prolife

More lives have been saved in just one month of the Texas law than all lives saved from illegal abortion by Roe. V Wade in its entire existence.,"**reposting this because I think something happened with the links, I’ll put the source links in the comments** 

I just wanted to put this in perspective for everyone.


So let’s start here, The average number of abortions in Texas from 2017-2020 was 55,649. Divided by 12 months, this means the average number of abortions per month was 4,637, give or take. According to the Boston Globe, abortions have gone down in Texas 50% since the law was implemented, which using the 4,637 number, means about 2,318 lives have been saved. 
Now, on to the lives “saved” by Roe v. Wade.
The number of deaths from illegal abortions in the entire country in 1972 was 39. This is the only year I have been able to find data on, but just by looking at the trend of maternal mortality, and general medical advances in the past years, I think we can safely assume the death rate would be trending downward, but, let’s still go by the 39 deaths of 1972 to be safe. Roe v. Wade has existed for 48 years. If Roe hadn’t existed, there supposedly would have been 1,872 illegal abortion deaths, meaning 1,872 lives have been saved by Roe.


So putting it all together, in just **one month** of the Texas law, which only impacts the people of **one** state, **2,318 lives have been saved**. On the contrary, Roe v. Wade’s passage has saved **1,872** women, **nation wide**, over the course of **48 years**.",t2_7ql0gfwv,1638891854,prolife

Looking forward to ending Roe Vs Wade,"Sometimes it is best to let the wordsmiths speak for me. To quote Matt Walsh, ""I want Roe to be overturned because abortion is an atrocity that kills millions of children. But also it is a major bonus that its overturning would cause misery and suffering among the very worst people on Earth. I will be glad for that. The people who have overseen, cheered on, facilitated, and encouraged the mass slaughter of 60 million babies deserve to suffer. That is justice. It would be good for the world and for their own souls. They are hideously evil. The worst that humanity has to offer.""

What can you say?,"I was reading a topic on r/askreddit the other day and the following really caught my attention:

https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r797tr/what_do_you_genuinely_think_will_happen_in_the/hmzlji8/

It was from a woman whose ex threatened her life when she was pregnant, and she got away from him and later had an abortion.  She's now happily married, with a great job and children with her new husband (plus multiple cats from the prev. relationship), and she claimed all these good things came about b/c she was able to get an abortion, and if she hadn't been, her situation would've only gotten worse.  She ended by saying that so many people were not just better off, but alive b/c of abortions.  Which brings me back to the title of this post - what can you possibly say to someone who's been through such a situation?

I myself am pro-life, always have been, and I sympathized with her story (which tbqh was fairly depressing at first).  But, at the same time,  I obv. couldn't condone her ultimate decision to not have her abuser's baby, and I knew full well that any attempt to respond as such directly would've resulted in being bombarded with all kinds of hateful things b/c I'm part of the problem or whatever.  So, as someone who's not had very many conversations overall on the topic of abortion, how do you stand firm on and defend your position as a pro-life individual while being understanding of another person's situation, especially when said situation was so bad?",t2_152zf7,1638733034,prolife

Anthony and Stanton, carried letters, essays and editorials debating many issues of the day, including articles decrying ""child murder"" and ""infanticide."" According to historians A.

Philosophical and Ontological Argument of Form And Matter and it’s relation to the Abortion Argument,"This is my best understanding of the Philosophical argument against abortion, but I might have a very simplistic understanding. But here is my understanding of it:

Related to: Aristotelian Pre-Modernism and his understanding of Form vs. Matter, providing the philosophical basis for the Ontological Argument. 

Prefaced Example:

An acorn has the potential to become an oak tree, but that potential can only be actualized as a result of the acorn being acted upon by such external factors as sunlight and water. And the nutrients present in the soil in which it's planted.

The meat and Potatoes:

Aristotle believed that what is true of the acorn is true of you and I. Each of us is a combination of Matter and Form. The Matter of which we are composed explains what is unique or particular about each of us, and our Form explains what we have in common, what constitutes our essential human-ness. 

Each of us is a combination of Matter and Form. That combination forms a unique substance which we call by a name. It is the potentialities built into the human Form that define or limit the ways in which we can change/develop in accord with our essential nature. [Note that it's not possible for a thing to fulfill all of its potentialities, as they can
sometimes be in conflict with one another.]

So... 
If hylomorphism is true, then it's your Form that makes you human, and it's the potentialities inherent to that Form that define and distinguish what it
means to be human. So you are fully human by virtue of possessing those potentialities, regardless of the extent to which you actualized them, and you possess them the moment Form is instantiated in Matter, to become the unique Substance that is you.

So, in conclusion, you are human, and fully so, from the moment of conception.",t2_4lyad7c4,1638680016,prolife

"Regardless of your stance on abortion, Roe v Wade is legal garbage and should be struck down","What a lot of people fail to consider when talking about roe v wade is the actual reasoning behind the Supreme Court's ruling. The majority essentially argued that a woman has a constitutional right to privacy and therefore the state has no authority to interfere in the private medical decision of killing her unborn child between the woman and her doctor.

 But the right to privacy DOES NOT EXIST under the constitution. There's the 4th amendment that protects against unreasonable search and seizure, and there's the right to due process. But these are not the same thing as a blanket right to privacy. So all the arguments about viability and whether or not you think abortion is morally correct are irrelevant because Roe v Wade is pure conjecture with no actual constitutional basis. And a lot of people forget that the job of the Supreme Court is NOT to decide whether a law is good or bad, simply whether or not that law is permissible within the parameters of the constitution.

That being said, I challenge any pro abortionist to show exactly where in the constitution, written by the founding fathers in 1789, it says that a woman has the right to kill her unborn child before the third trimester. Or even where it says there's a blanket right to privacy",t2_80ue05fh,1638593151,prolife
What do you think of this pro-choice argument?,"I'm pro-choice, and I'll admit that pro-life arguments are usually easier to make. (1) Killing innocent people is wrong, (2) fetuses are innocent people, (3) abortion is killing a fetus, and therefore, (4) abortion is wrong. The argument is simple, intuitive, and doesn't involve a lot of nuance. Usually, pro-choice supporters attack (2), and argue that fetuses aren't people. To the contrary, I do believe fetuses are people. I can't think of a definition of a *human being* that wouldn't describe a fetus. I even believe that life begins at conception — again, I can't think of a definition of *life* that would not also describe a human embryo or zygote. I wouldn't say fetuses are human at conception, but at some point before birth, fetuses do become living humans, and abortions kill them. So yes, I concede that abortions kill humans.

I think the correct premise to attack is (1). To say that ""killing innocent people is wrong"" is far too simple of a way to describe society's relationship with life and death. We clearly place a limit on the value of life, and accept otherwise avoidable deaths for the sake of our well-being.

Thousands of Americans are killed in car accidents every year. We could simply ban the use of automobiles, and save thousands of lives. We don't ban cars because driving is too beneficial. By reducing travel time, cars enable us to be more productive, interact with more people, and live in spread out communities that would otherwise consist of smaller properties and be more expensive. We accept all of this for the cost of accidents and countless deaths.

What about nut allergies? A couple hundred Americans die every year from allergic reactions to nuts. We could easily ban the production of nuts, and save what would accumulate to hundreds of lives over a few years, but we aren't even willing to outlaw Reese's Pieces to accomplish this. Society finds peanut butter too tasty to sacrifice for the lives of those allergic.

War? Considering the value pro-lifers place on human life, one would expect them to be radical pacifists. Is every president who knowingly sent soldiers to die a ""killer""? Was it wrong to fight the Civil War and World War Two? No. Some wars are obviously unjust, but human life is sometimes the price that must be paid to live in a better world. Even the most moral wars require the sacrifice of innocent lives, and almost no one objects to this notion.

What about the slaughter of animals that happens every day? They aren't human, but they certainly feel more pain than fetuses. Seeing how most people are not vegetarians, it must be widely accepted that the taste and nutrition provided by animals outweighs the cost of their (painful) killings.

We are clearly willing to allow innocent life to die. Ultimately, there's a cost-benefit analysis going. When it comes to abortions, the cost is the life of the fetus, and the benefit is the woman being unburdened by parenthood. The thrust of the pro-choice argument really lies in this latter side of the equation.

Cost — Not all life has equal value. I think almost everyone would acknowledge this. (Whose life would you save, a 90 year-old in a vegetative state or Isaac Newton? The answer is pretty clear.) Aborted fetuses in particular have very little value. They do not have identities, thoughts, emotions or feel pain, and they are unwanted and unloved. They do have some value, but not much.

Benefit — Instead of having an obligation to raise a child, which will be incredibly burdensome, a woman can invest that time in her education or career. Children require around-the-clock supervision for the first few years of their lives, can't be left alone for the first ten, and still require resources for the first twenty. Abortion allows women to save this time — at least until they feel ready to have children — and invest it in more productive outlets.

Analysis — Ultimately, I think the benefit that abortion provides women clearly outweighs the cost. Again, I concede that an abortion is technically the killing of a human. But we allow people to die when we feel it can be justified, and abortion is such a case.",t2_37pjoj1y,1638592462,prolife

Banning Abortion vs. Targeting the Causes of Abortion,"Hello Everybody! 

Today I want to ask about different methods of reducing abortion and the political and personal steps you as individuals are taking to prevent or reduce the rate of abortions.

Abortion is obviously a high-tension political issue in the modern world and for very understandable reasons. Personally I am pro-choice, but if I believed that a fetus was a person I could see myself changing some of my opinions.

What I wanted to talk about today was how people go about reducing abortions. To me it seems like there are two main ways to target this issue: through banning abortion and/or through targeting and eliminating the cause for abortions.

The main route towards reducing abortions made by pro-lifers seem to be in banning abortion and causing legal repercussions for those who have an abortion. What I want to question today is if this method of targeting abortion is the most practical or successful method for ending abortions?

Even if Roe v Wade is repealed and states are able to decide what their abortion laws are this will not end abortions. Blue states will still have legal abortions and even those in states that ban abortions will be able to get an abortion by travelling out of state. 

Conversely targeting the causes for women getting abortions is something that can be implemented in both Red and Blue states ([https://qz.com/857273/the-sharpest-drops-in-abortion-rates-in-america-have-been-under-democratic-presidents/](https://qz.com/857273/the-sharpest-drops-in-abortion-rates-in-america-have-been-under-democratic-presidents/)). Most abortions are motivated by financial reasons, timing concerns, child-care concerns or unwanted pregnancy ([https://www.verywellhealth.com/reasons-for-abortion-906589](https://www.verywellhealth.com/reasons-for-abortion-906589)). Here are some examples of political actions that can be taken to reduce abortion rates by targeting these causes: 

1. More comprehensive sex education to prevent unwanted pregnancies. ([https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/study-finds-comprehensive-sex-education-reduces-teen-pregnancy](https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/study-finds-comprehensive-sex-education-reduces-teen-pregnancy))
2. Easier access to contraceptives. ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/13/abortion-law-fewer-women-having-abortions-why/1424236001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/13/abortion-law-fewer-women-having-abortions-why/1424236001/)
3. Reducing the financial burden that pregnancy and child care cause through programs like paid maternity leave or universal health care.
4. Improving the foster-care or adoption process.

Here are some examples of personal actions you can take to target these causes for abortion:

1. Adopt or become a foster parent and give them a happy childhood
2. Donate money or goods to low-income families
3. Volunteer at schools in low-income neighborhoods
4. donate to scholarships for children of foster care

To me this seems like the path of least resistance if the ultimate goal is to reduce abortions. What are your thoughts on this?

As someone who is pro-life do you support these methods for reducing abortion rates? Do you think that targeting the causes for abortions is a worse or better method that banning abortions? Do you think that it will ever be possible to ban abortion in democratic states? Do you think that volunteering is more or less productive than protesting at abortion clinics?

Thought of this argument recently re bodily autonomy and wanted to share.,"Sometimes I see the argument made that you should have absolute control over your body, and so you should be able to remove a fetus from it.

If you should be able to remove *anything* from your body, it follows that you should be able to remove not just a fetus from your body, but also a fetus's hands, eyes, legs, etc., even if you don't remove the rest of it.

If this is denied, then it is acknowledged that bodily autonomy should, in some circumstances, be curtailed for the good of the fetus.

In that case it is difficult to see why the fetus's interest in not being mutilated supersedes bodily autonomy but not its interest in not being killed.",t2_5xlvuofn,1638472575,prolife

Question for Christian pro-lifers: How do you reconcile “person” being defined as just a “human being” and the idea that God consists of 3 persons?,"This question isn’t meant to sound antagonistic or unnecessarily combative. I’m genuinely asking because I see a lot of prolifers on this sub say that the term “person” is synonymous with “human being.” And since fetuses are beings with unique human DNA distinct from the mother, it is therefore a person.

I’m curious how this understanding of personhood coincides with the Trinitarian idea of God being “one in 3 persons.” If person equates to human, how then can God consist of 3 persons? 

I would argue that this suggests that the prolife definition of *personhood* as “humanness” may need some revising. But I’m curious to hear your thoughts.",t2_38qy6ydl,1638455319,prolife
I wanted to address a Pro-choice “gotcha”- Brain Dead,"This is an argument we see often. It is generally setup as how we define death of a human. It’s when their brain ceases to function in most cases. Because the unborn at early stages have not developed a fully functioning brain they often use that as a justification by saying they are essentially “brain-dead” beings. 

Why this argument doesn’t hold up may not be obvious to everyone so I wanted to break down different aspects of this since I can’t fall asleep. 

1) What is death? I am a scientist and I see this from a biological perspective, “the permanent ending of vital processes in a cell or tissue.”

When brain death occurs someone is dead, there can still be a heart beat and if they are on an oxygen machine the tissues can remain intact. But the brain is no longer functioning and function can no longer occur. This means the organism is dead. We can artificially keep the body in a stasis but it can no longer self regulate. 

Now some people have regulation issues that require interventions but brain death is entirely different because no function can maintain on its own, or even recover. 

2) in the case with the unborn they are dependent on the parent for survival but they are developing and growing on their own. It is regulating its own body within the womb. If the unborn were dead or equivalent to a brain dead person biologically they wouldn’t be capable of what they do which is develop. 

Tl:dr If someone is brain dead their biological functions are ceased or beginning to completely cease. But an embryo unless they die a natural death is a growing developing organism. Hence not comparable to a brain dead person as they are not a dead organism.",t2_z60ei,1638454496,prolife
My prediction on what will happen with SCOTUS,"Ultimately, I think the justices will rule in favor of the Mississippi law, but in a way that does not directly overturn Roe v Wade.

Why?

Because the courts has only ever once gone back and said they were actually wrong, the Dred Scott case, and that was almost 100 years later in a very cut and dry case. They just don't like saying as an institution they are wrong. From what I have heard in the oral arguments, it definitely feels like the justices are leaning towards ruling in favor of the Mississippi bill, but a couple have hesitation in directly overturning Roe. The ruling, if it goes how I predict, would allow abortion restrictions while not overturning Roe, but creating a loophole where you can actually have a restrictive law without being sued the next day.",t2_3wfn4fyy,1638454496,prolife
"If you're ""pro-life but believe in rape exceptions"" then I'm almost certain that you'll change that view eventually. Here's why:","I'd like to start by prefacing that **I do believe people who say they are ""pro-life with rape exceptions"" are genuinely pro-life**. As opposed to people who say they are ""pro-life except when the mother is poor or the baby will be disabled"" or the dreaded ""*personally pro-life*"" I do believe that people who are ""pro-life with rape exceptions"" **should be classified as pro-life and are allies in the course**.

I am simply making this post not to attack these people, but to put forward reasons for why I think people come to this position and why I believe ultimately people who hold this position will eventually abandon it and either become pro-choice or fully pro-life.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I believe this is simply that being ""pro-life with rape exceptions"" when looked at from a logical perspective is **arbitrary**. Why? Well let's examine the issue. The abortion debate hinges on two major questions:

1. Are the unborn people?
2. What is the extent of bodily autonomy.

Now I'm not going to debate these in this post as this has been done numerous times before and all that is relevant to the discussion is what views people should have, given that they have come to specific conclusions on the above questions.

For example if you believe that the ""unborn aren't people"" and/or ""bodily autonomy means people have a right to **directly** harm others"", then you **logically** should be pro-choice up until birth. Or if you don't think bodily autonomy trumps right to life then you should be pro-choice up until when you believe the unborn become people.

It would make no sense to hold any other position. If someone believed that the unborn weren't people until 6 months then it would be ridiculous for them to be okay with abortion bans after 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

The same is true vice versa. If you believe that the unborn are human from conception (a.k.a the scientific answer) and that bodily autonomy doesn't give people the right to **directly** harm others then you should be against abortion in pretty much every case. You can not logically justify abortion without **admittedly doing evil**.

&amp;#x200B;

Now people who are ""pro-life with rape exceptions"" are generally people who have reached the conclusion that ""the unborn **are people**"" and ""bodily autonomy does **not** trump right to life"". So then **logically** if abortion in cases of rape is to be **justified or not evil** then one of those two variables **must change**.

...But they don't.

People conceived from rape are just as human and innocent as people who were conceived with loving parents.

And if you've already come to the conclusion that bodily autonomy does not allow for people to **directly** harm other people. Then bodily autonomy shouldn't allow you to **directly** harm someone conceived in rape either, because an abortion of a child conceived in rape is still an example of an innocent person being **directly** harmed.

&amp;#x200B;

So why do many people hold the view that rape is a legitimate reason to have an abortion? Well there's one reason and it's the reason why the position is not ""a pro-lifers *final form*"".

**Emotion**.

At the end of the day the only way you can justify a rape exception is with **emotional** arguments **NOT logical** arguments. Because the position as I have outlined before is **illogical.**

Either the unborn aren't people and/or bodily autonomy means we have a right to directly harm others, and in that case why are there restrictions at all? Abortion should be legal for reasons besides just rape.

Or the unborn are people and bodily autonomy doesn't give us the right to directly harm others. Which in that case means that abortion due to rape **logically** shouldn't be an exception because being conceived in rape does not change the unborn's personhood or the notion that bodily autonomy doesn't allow the direct harm of others.

&amp;#x200B;

At best people try to justify it by saying ""it will be traumatic for the mother"", but when you detach the argument from its emotional appeal you realise it makes no sense. We don't allow the **direct** harming of **innocent people** in order to prevent emotional hardship of others.

Abortion will not **un-rape** anybody, that's just **reality**. Abortion will only cause another innocent human being to die and for the rape victim to become the mother of a **dead person**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In fact I'm willing to believe that most people who believe in rape exceptions to some extent aren't entirely convinced of the unborn's humanity or believe that while they are human they are of a lesser form.

Because if I give an example like the one below which is analogous to abortion (**given that you believe the unborn are people**) almost every sane person will understand why killing the child would be wrong.

Let's say a woman is taken captive by someone and the person rapes them. They become pregnant and eventually give birth to a child. A couple months after the police find the woman and her captor is arrested and the woman is freed. The place where she lives has an adoption backlog and it'll take about 9 months for her to be able to give up her kid meaning that she'll have to take care of her kid for that time. The woman has severe PTSD and post natal depression, she hates her kid as it reminds her of her time being captive and would prefer that the kid was dead. Should she be allowed to kill her born child?

Any sane person will say that while her circumstances are unfortunate, and the mother's plight is something that we should be sympathetic to. That doesn't justify her **harming an innocent human being** even if it will ""*supposedly*"" help her mental health.

In fact if you're someone who is in the ""rape exceptions"" camp and you read this and came to the same conclusion you might be confused as to why you feel differently in the case above to a case of abortion. Well the only significant difference is that in one instance the child is unborn and in the other the child is born.

Which is why I believe that people who support ""rape exceptions"" haven't fully formed their stance because they're still struggling to grasp with the humanity of the unborn.

**Now that's not to say they are far off**. After all they still have come to the conclusion that abortion is wrong, whether because they instinctively understand that it's killing a human being or because they find the arguments for why the unborn are human to be sufficient.

They most likely fall victim to emotion and this clouds their logical reasoning. Hence while they may be convinced that the arguments for the unborn being persons are correct. They emotionally still feel as though they are not 100% equal. Or maybe they don't want to feel as though they are ""causing rape victims harm"" and simply say they are for rape exceptions so that they can make the argument against less sympathetic cases.

But luckily, in time I do have hope that once people solidify their positions and go over the logic for **why** they believe what they believe they'll eventually have a more **refined** view for the abortion debate (a.k.a their view will be fully logically consistent).

So if you gave me 10 pro-lifers who believed in rape exceptions I'd say with time 9 of those would go on to refine their view and see how it is logically consistent to not support a rape exception.

While maybe 1 or 2 will go the other way and realize that if they believe that it's okay to **directly harm** people to alleviate the trauma of a rape victim, then why not for someone who's financially struggling or who's not ready for a chid etc... and eventually they'll just become pro-choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we are not pro-life because ""pregnancy should be a punishment for women having sex"", how someone became pregnant is **irrelevant**. We are pro-life because we view the unborn as **innocent human beings** and because we understand that we don't have a right to **directly harm** others, specifically **innocent human beings**. These factors are true for pregnancies that were the result of a consensual relationship as well as those that were the result of rape, therefore in order to be logically consistent you must either allow abortion in **both** cases or in **none** of them.

Thoughts on the trauma of adoption?,"Adoption is typically seen as an acceptable alternative to abortion once a pregnancy has started. Given that most pro-life people view abortion as murder, surely it’s better than being murdered, right?

I recently joined a Facebook group where adoptees share their experiences around being adopted, and I was shocked to find that almost all of them are extremely negative. Many of the folks there explicitly state that they would have preferred to have been aborted rather than adopted out to another family. Additionally, the suicide rate among adoptees is more than 4x higher than it is among children raised by their biological family.

The consensus among the folks who actually suffer the consequences of adoption seem to believe that it is better to be dead than alive and adopted.

Is this something pro-life folks are aware of, or consider when they offer adoption as an alternative?",t2_3gcqeben,1638431169,prolife

"How do I, as the only pro-life person in my family, deal with knowing that if my family knew my feelings on abortion they'd absolutely hate me and be disgusted?","Long story short, my best friend from high school's mother tried to abort him when he was an unborn child. Before I knew him, I was staunchly pro-choice. Ever since I met him, though, I just could never again get myself to be pro-choice again, and so I am pro-life. However, I feel guilty, uncomfortable, and bad about myself for being pro-life, because of how my family, particularly my mother, brother, and sister, speak of and view pro-lifers. Part of me wishes I could convince myself to be pro-choice again, but I know that that would violate my conscience and what I believe to be the truth.

Why are they still falling back on Roe? It still sucks.,"You'd think the Pro-Choice movement would have found a better argument in nearly 50 years time.  I understand if they want to be like the 2A people, but at least their right is actually written in the Constitution. No matter how hard I look, I can't seem to find the word 'abortion'. 

I wonder how the 9 Justices supported their findings in Roe? The truth that Cori Bush doesn't want to realize is the Court became a legislature for a day. Roe v Wade is still a terrible decision legally, even if you agree that abortion is to remain legal. A video in this post by an underrated political YouTuber sums up the Opinion in Roe. I think it is exceptionally relevant to today's Oral Arguments, since Roe v Wade will be discussed at nauseam.

Of the 3 institutionalist conservatives, Chief Justice Roberts seemed to be the only one trying to find a middle ground. Justice Barrett(she mentioned how adoption makes abortion not necessary at one point) seemed firmly against *Roe* and Justice Kavanaugh asked a lot of questions pertaining to the Court needing to be neutral. That to me sounds like basically judge-speak for ""this isn't our place."" 

So my prediction is 5-3 striking down *Roe* and *Casey* and sending the issue back to Congress and the states with a concurrence from the Chief saying he would have pushed the line back to uphold the Mississippi law at issue but while leaving a zombie *Roe* and *Casey* intact.",t2_6okm7rir,1638386702,prolife

Ways to obsolete almost all abortions,"These are secular ways to make unwanted pregnancies never occur

* Financial incentives for **voluntary** vasectomies &amp; tubal ligation
* Year 2021 health science-based &amp; WHO-approved sex education starting a year before puberty
* Year 2021 health science-based &amp; WHO-approved family planning starting a year before legal age of marriage
* Free or easy to access contraception

If all these things were made possible then odds are no one would need any abortions unless due to

* rape
* incest
* health of mother is at risk

Odds are if the rapists were trained before puberty that rape &amp; incest are bad then odds are they wouldn't rape or incest.

These mothers live on annual household income of &lt;$5,000, &lt;$2,500 &amp; &lt;$1,250.

Abortion: the slippery slope to euthanasia,"Back in the 1970s, after abortion was legalized nationally here in the US by the Roe v Wade decision, prolifers sounded like alarmist conspiracy theorists when they warned that it would lead to euthanasia.

They were right.

I consider myself so immeasurably blessed to have found the Catholic Faith so many decades ago: the more I study of history, the more I see that they were often the only agency or institution to stand in opposition to things like abortion, eugenics, euthanasia, and also against abuses of animals such as bullfighting and vivisection.

What I am looking for is not the arguments themselves -- I have heard likely most of them, I know them, and I agree with them; what I am looking for is how to deliver the message with wisdom and compassion as to not send the wrong message.

Pretty sure it is not wise at all to just say directly: ""If you kill your rapist's baby you are a murderer"", right? There has to be a better way.

Pro-Choice statements and my Pro-Life opinions.,"If I haven't mentioned something or got something wrong don't hesitate to write it down in the comments:

The fetuses could grow up to live a horrible life, so it is better to kill them early so they can't experience pain and sorrow.

There are some fetuses who will want to live later on, so it is best to let each individual decide for themselves.
Besides I don't think that killing someone is a solution, you usually only use this method when you can't help anymore.
Improving the environment in which the fetus will eventually grow up in and trying to treat depression more effectivly could be a start.

The mother could become miserable because she is forced to be a mother.

Women who do not want to have their children, should have an easier time adopting.

Why are raped women and women who will have a life threatening birth allowed to have an abortion but not everyone else if every fetus is the same?

I believe that a women should be chosen over a fetus when she was raped or when a pregnancy mishap occurs that can result in her death.
Simply because she isn't at fault in that case.
Fetuses should have rights too though and shouldn't be killed because a condom broke.

Why does the fetus count as a human life at all, isn't it just a cell of the woman?

The egg cell is part of the woman, when it becomes fertilized though it becomes its own entity.

For example 1 week old Jeff is the same entity as 12 year old Jeff, the fetus isn't switched out with another entity mid pregnancy.
So when you kill the fetus you are killing an underdeveloped Jeff, at the end of the day it is still Jeff though.

What is the difference between sperm and a fetus?

Sperm needs an egg cell to become a fetus, so if you wait 100 years the sperm will still be a sperm.
Just as a cat will always be a cat, it doesn't change.
A fetus grows but also stays the same individual. 
A sperm cell is broken down and it's DNA is used to build the fetus.
Sperm + nothing = Sperm
Sperm + egg cell = Fetus
You can not use the same value.

What if women illegally abort and injure themselves?

I believe that if you do something illegal and dangerous, you have to face the consequences.

Thoughts on this prochoice argument?,"Abortion is a very challenging and complicated issue. My personal belief is that what makes an entity worthy of moral consideration is the presence of **mental states.** A mental state can refer to a perception, a pain experience, belief, desire, intention, emotion, or a memory. Everything we think of as the ‘soul’ of a person can be reduced to our mental states. Even a person in a coma has mental states. They have what are called ***standing states*** (or dispositional states), meaning that they exist somewhere in the back of one's mind but currently play no active role in any mental processes. For example, while Lucy is engaged in her favorite video game, she still believes that cats have four legs and desires to get a pet cat on her next birthday. But these two states play no active role in her current state of mind. Another example comes from dreamless sleep when most or all of our mental states are standing states. This is also why a person who emerges from a coma often still have some of their memories or beliefs in tact and why they still retain aspects of their personality. Their mental states don’t completely vanish in a coma. They are stored in the brain, although many of those mental states may be radically altered or lost to brain injury.

So our moral considerations are tied to the presence or absence of mental states. The reason why it’s morally permissible to kill something like a plant is because plants do not have any mental states, standing or otherwise. They are still ‘alive’ in a biological sense, but they can’t be *harmed,* since there are no mental states there to be affected — and thus it does not make sense to say one ‘murdered’ a plant.  

The same is true of the pre-conscious fetus. Until a certain stage of development, it does not have any mental states. Only reflexive movements. And since everything we think of as the “soul” can be found in our mental states, no soul is being lost in an abortion. A developing human body is certainly being killed. But no one is being murdered. There’s no *’there’* there. Nobody’s home. The shell is empty.

For these reasons, I don’t think there’s anything ethically wrong with having an abortion prior to the 24th week of pregnancy (when the baby develops the capacity for mental states). After this point, I think abortion should only be legally permitted when the mother’s life is at risk. Any other reason I think would be murder.",t2_38qy6ydl,1637859823,prolife

"The world needs lots more kindness. Dehumanizing humans is never okay. Yet when more powerful groups do it, they feel justified.","Trigger warning: Sad. I want to write this in hopes that we can make the world better going forward. 

When I visited the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague, I learned that these people were separated from the rest of society. They could only bury their dead in one small plot of land. To save space, they had to bury people vertically. This attitude of dehumanization is a logical step to what happened next. Adjacent to the cemetery is a museum commemorating the Jewish people who were killed in the holocaust. Their names covered the walls. What was the saddest to me were the drawing by children who were in concentration camps. I distinctly remember that many of them drew sea creatures, same as I did as a kid, same as my kids do. We often see pictures of holocaust victims after they were dehumanized but we have to remember that these were shop owners, teachers, musicians, mothers, fathers and children that were killed because they were “different.” They weren’t essentially different than the more powerful group who victimized them. They were human. 

I also visited a concentration camp “town.” It was a town that was taken over by the Nazis and made into a concentration camp. They tricked the Red Cross into thinking they were treating their prisoners well but they were doing anything but that. I saw the incinerators there and I saw one outside the Family Planning Associates where I did sidewalk counseling for 3 years. The resemblance between the two places could not be ignored.  

Different does not mean less. If only people knew this before the holocaust, before the victimization on Native Americans and African Americans. If only we could treat each other with respect and dignity from the moment of conception. How would our world look then?

"From a secular standpoint of ethics, what separates a fetus from an animal or insect?","I'm curious about the moral reasoning of pro-lifers.

It can be said that humans are separated from animals by their intelligence. Killing an ant is not considered wrong because the ant's perception of the world is highly limited, and it is not even clear that it would experience suffering in the same way that humans do. Additionally, they lack the same identity and experiences that humans have.

It is a widely accepted fact that brains in fetuses (especially during younger years) are either not developed at all, or developed to a very limited extent. Either the fetus lacks a brain, or its brain has less capacity than that of an insect.

Considering this, what is the ethical difference between the death of animals and insects and the death of a fetus?",t2_91k8pubd,1637774929,prolife

Abortion in cases with babies with severe disabilities,"I am pro life and have a friend/acquaintance who is also pro life. We went to the same faith-based college. 

Her first daughter was discovered to have only 1% brain function while in utero. My friend birthed her daughter knowing that she would pass shortly after birth. They discovered that both parents carry a recessive gene that has a 1 in 4 chance of causing the baby to be born with this rare condition which always results in the child passing shortly after birth. 

She gets pregnant a second time, discovers at 12 weeks that the baby has received the genes and will be born with the same condition. It’s confirmed that the baby’s brain isn’t developing. She carries the baby to term, gives birth, and the baby dies shortly after delivery. 

A few mutual friends and I were discussing this. One person suggested that she could have had an abortion at 12 weeks, saving herself the pain of pregnancy and childbirth. The mother is functioning as “life support” to the child, and ending their life at the point isn’t too different than their life ending at 40 weeks.

"Simple counter-argument to ""bodily autonomy""","So the BA argument states that a woman has the right to absolute bodily autonomy, so that anyone that happens to use her body without consent faces the possibilty of getting killed if that's what's necessary to have them stop use her body.

The second part of argument states that the mother had not consented to the pregnancy.


Ok, so here's the first issue:
Pregnancy is a natural and direct (i. e. There's no middle man responsible for the final consequence) consequence to sex. Many other things have similar characteristics.

If you ask to get shot in the foot you can't say you didn't consent to the bleeding, because you did by consenting to the actions.

If you provoke a dog, you can't just kill the dog for biting you, you consented to it.


The second issue is that pregnancy forces a human being (zygote) into existence and at the same time into a state of dependency. It would be immoral to kill the zygote.

Here's an analogy for this: Imagine if someone attaches a sort of string that, if removed, kills you but the host stays alive. The string naturally gets removed after 9 months. 
Is it moral for the host to remove the string, even though it will kill you and you didn't remove it in the first place?

Just a thought about personhood arguments in regards with legality and law,"Don't personhood arguments technically allow for an individual to potentially only get a minor sentence or even a fine with killing a pregnant woman's child whether she wanted the baby or not.  Because the grounds of personhood arguments aren't a woman's choice but the devaluing of a human. Since the personhood is revoked the killing would be akin to killing someone's pet cat which would result in a major fine or 3 years at best depending on the jurisdiction.  But that also raises another question -  What is the child if not a person?  Property? Technically that would be a sort of legal slavery without the labor, weird huh?",t2_dnqsna23,1637311879,prolife
What are the pro life views on the natural loss of fertilized embryos?,"I'm pretty much neutral on the issue of abortion as I'm not very knowledgeable on the subject and non religious, but interested in the debate and arguments.

From my understanding, the fundamental reasoning for pro life without the citing of religious authority is that a human starts being a human at conception. And abortion at any stage would essentially be a case of murder.

So with this as a premise what are the pro life conservative views and possible solutions to the fact that there are as many as 60% of all fertilized eggs that get spontaneously aborted as a result of inevitable embryo abnormality([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9998/))?

I'll admit I haven't read into too much abortion debates so I might have missed it if some prominent conservative figures have already countered the argument, but since I haven't: 

If lives do become lives at conception, as much as we want to prevent hundreds of thousands of abortions each year, shouldn't it be much more urgent that we also prevent tens of millions of other human lives from perishing by perhaps mandating the preservation of aborted embryos and perhaps save them in incubation chambers and gestate them in labs or wombs of the volunteers?",t2_ji16s3,1637304584,prolife

When the health of the mother is at risk?

When the health of the child is at risk? (Such as having a genetic abnormality that will lead to a very short lifespan (Like less than 1-2 years), or a condition that leads to a very low quality of life)

And if you answer yes to any of those:

Do you believe that on some level (however small) the value of the life of the unborn child is less than the value of the life of the mother?

This might seem like a bad faith ""gotcha"", but I don't think so. I don't think it's necessarily hypocritical to believe the life of the unborn is ""less"" than that of the mother while also believing that life is too valuable to end through abortion.

What is the ideal Pro-Life policy?,"I consider myself to be somewhat Pro-Life as I think killing of the unborn violates the non aggression principle and is inhumane. However in practice, I’m not sure how it would be in acted in policy. It is not a universal violation of NAP as the way 1st degree homicide or rape is, so that’s why we have this disconnect over the issue. 

For instance, I’m not totally against overturning Roe vs Wade and that individual states will set their abortion policies. However, that could be detrimental for the mother as we may see an uptick in back ally abortions. Women’s health is important to me as is the rights of the unborn. Therefore, I think my ideal abortion policy stance would include making abortion legal up until about 8-10 weeks to give individuals time to assess their own health with medical professionals. I think giving that timeframe and providing exceptions for rape and incest for me is a happy medium for Pro-Choicers and Pro-Lifers.",t2_8ictz694,1637274015,prolife

"Would you agree that people who think that most people in any large movement/ideology support it for ""the sake of being evil"" etc are highly ignorant people."," Now before I start off I want to emphasize the ""**majority** of people"" and ""**evil for the sake of being evil**"". Not to have these confused with ""**outliers/minorities** of people"" and ""**evil to achieve a goal**"".

I've always believed that a good litmus test for how well someone understands an argument is how well that person can portray and understand their opponents arguments and positions even if they don't agree with them.

One of the most important things to understand is people's **motivations** for supporting something, that's why I find it disappointing to say the least whenever I hear someone say that people who oppose them on an issue are ""evil for the sake of being evil"" or ""simply hate X just because"". This is lazy thinking and is in almost every case a far cry from the actual motivations a group has a position.

While I believe this for pretty much all debates and positions, since we're on [r/prolife](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/) we can use abortion as an example.

While I am pro-life, I am able to comprehend **why** someone would be pro-choice. No, it's not because ""they hate children for the sake of it"" or ""they get a kick out of killing people"", even if you could find someone who had this motivation they would be an **outlier/a minority** of the pro-choice side. Instead the vast majority either hold their position because they ""don't believe what they're doing is immoral (i.e. they think the unborn aren't human)"" or their stance is derived from **selfishness**, which although you may point out is an ""**evil**"" reason to support something that you know to be immoral, and you'd be correct in that notion. But it's a whole lot different from ""evil simply for the sake of being evil"", rather it's ""evil for **the sake of achieving a goal**"", almost no one in history has ever had ""being evil **just because**"" as their motivation and even those that did were what we would describe as ""sociopaths"", which make up a small minority of the population at whole. In history most **evil** actions were committed by **regular** **people** who either didn't think what they were doing was wrong, thought they were justified in what they were doing or were selfish/seeking to gain something from their actions. To dismiss evil actions of the past as simply ""the actions of evil people being evil"" shows ignorance and a lack of critical thinking.

And when I said this applies to almost all positions I meant it. ""What about the Nazi's"" I can already hear someone saying. Most Nazi's were **normal, everyday people** who supported what they supported due to years of **propaganda, fearmongering and being disconnected from the reality of their regime's actions**. If you lived in Nazi Germany and believed the propaganda of the regime (which would have been your only/largest source of information unlike nowadays where we have the internet) and lived through an economic depression being told that a specific group of people caused it, you most likely would have supported laws and actions that discriminated against those people. Not because you ""hate them for the sake of hating them"" but because you genuinely believe you are supporting justice for an alleged wrongdoing that has been done to you.

Now before anyone get's the wrong idea I'm not **justifying** evil actions done in the past. I'm simply saying that for the **vast majority** of people, their motivations for supporting these sorts of things was not because they are just ""hateful people"", but rather because they believed they weren't doing anything wrong or they thought that their actions were justified in the name of justice. So despite having ""good"" intentions, their actions/actions they supported were **still wrong**. And of course as I mentioned before this doesn't apply to **everyone**, people like Hitler, Himmler etc in my opinion were sociopaths and their motivations would be accurately described as ""**sadistic**"", I'm just saying that the **majority** of people who supported these movements weren't inherently evil and to think so would be ignorant.

So in conclusion, very few if any movements are derived from ""being evil for evil's sake"", almost every ideology/movement has a motivation that means it's members think it is doing something **they find moral** or they know what they are doing is immoral but they do it because **they have something to selfishly gain.** Almost no large group of any movement/ideology supports it ""just because"" and people who think so are in my opinion **ignorant**. So when someone tells me they think people are ""pro-life because they **hate women**"" or when someone tells me that they think ""the pro-choice movement is driven by people who find cracking children's skulls **fun**"" I can't help but see them as ignorant and lacking in the critical thinking that is required in order to see both sides of a debate.

What do you guys think? Do you think I'm too harsh in my assessment and that there are cases where believing a ""**majority** of people who support something are doing it **for the sake of being evil**"" is justified? Or would you agree with me that to see almost any major issue as that black and white show's a level of ignorance on the person's behalf?",t2_9ev60ea5,1637064847,prolife

One of the most important things to understand is people's **motivations** for supporting something, that's why I find it disappointing to say the least whenever I hear someone say that people who oppose them on an issue are ""evil for the sake of being evil"" or ""simply hate X just because"". This is lazy thinking and is in almost every case a far cry from the actual motivations a group has a position.

While I believe this for pretty much all debates and positions, since we're on r/prolife we can use abortion as an example.

While I am pro-life, I am able to comprehend **why** someone would be pro-choice. No, it's not because ""they hate children for the sake of it"" or ""they get a kick out of killing people"", even if you could find someone who had this motivation they would be an **outlier/a minority** of the pro-choice side. Instead the vast majority either hold their position because they ""don't believe what they're doing is immoral (i.e. they think the unborn aren't human)"" or their stance is derived from **selfishness**, which although you may point out is an ""**evil**"" reason to support something that you know to be immoral, and you'd be correct in that notion. But it's a whole lot different from ""evil simply for the sake of being evil"", rather it's ""evil for **the sake of achieving a goal**"", almost no one in history has ever had ""being evil **just because**"" as their motivation and even those that did were what we would describe as ""sociopaths"", which make up a small minority of the population at whole. In history most **evil** actions were committed by **regular** **people** who either didn't think what they were doing was wrong, thought they were justified in what they were doing or were selfish/seeking to gain something from their actions. To dismiss evil actions of the past as simply ""the actions of evil people being evil"" shows ignorance and a lack of critical thinking.

And when I said this applies to almost all positions I meant it. ""What about the Nazi's"" I can already hear someone saying. Most Nazi's were **normal, everyday people** who supported what they supported due to years of **propaganda, fearmongering and being disconnected from the reality of their regime's actions**. If you lived in Nazi Germany and believed the propaganda of the regime (which would have been your only/largest source of information unlike nowadays where we have the internet) and lived through an economic depression being told that a specific group of people caused it, you most likely would have supported laws and actions that discriminated against those people. Not because you ""hate them for the sake of hating them"" but because you genuinely believe you are supporting justice for an alleged wrongdoing that has been done to you.

Now before anyone get's the wrong idea I'm not **justifying** evil actions done in the past. I'm simply saying that for the **vast majority** of people, their motivations for supporting these sorts of things was not because they are just ""hateful people"", but rather because they believed they weren't doing anything wrong or they thought that their actions were justified in the name of justice. So despite having ""good"" intentions, their actions/actions they supported were **still wrong**. And of course as I mentioned before this doesn't apply to **everyone**, people like Hitler, Himmler etc in my opinion were sociopaths and their motivations would be accurately described as ""**sadistic**"", I'm just saying that the **majority** of people who supported these movements weren't inherently evil and to think so would be ignorant.

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion, very few if any movements are derived from ""being evil for evil's sake"", almost every ideology/movement has a motivation that means it's members think it is doing something **they find moral** or they know what they are doing is immoral but they do it because **they have something to selfishly gain.** Almost no large group of any movement/ideology supports it ""just because"" and people who think so are in my opinion **ignorant**. So when someone tells me they think people are ""pro-life because they **hate women**"" or when someone tells me that they think ""the pro-choice movement is driven by people who find cracking children's skulls **fun**"" I can't help but see them as ignorant and lacking in the critical thinking that is required in order to see both sides of a debate.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Do you think I'm too harsh in my assessment and that there are cases where believing a ""**majority** of people who support something are doing it **for the sake of being evil**"" is justified? Or would you agree with me that to see almost any major issue as that black and white show's a level of ignorance on the person's behalf?",t2_9ev60ea5,1637063458,prolife

"""It's my body and I have the right to do what I want with it""","I see this argument coming up a lot by pro-choicers. The right of body sovereignity. And they are right about that, every person should have the sovereignity over their own body. But what they willfully ignore is that when a woman gets pregnant, she becomes a host to another body, apart from herself. The body of the baby is not a part of the body of the woman, but is separate from it. The baby is a life on its own.

Another argument I see coming up is; if the baby is unwanted by me, the mother, than the baby is just a parasite within my body, because I never intended to have a baby. First of all; your intention when you had sex with someone can not change the fact if a baby is either a parasite or human baby. Intent has nothing to do with it. Just like you can't intend to have a boy or a girl, the baby that is forming in your body is either a boy or a girl. Your intent does not change any of that.

Secondly; If you, the mother, gets all the say of the fate of the baby. What does the concept of father even mean anymore? Are you also in favor of replacing the concept of a 'father' to 'sperm donor + financial sugar daddy' ? I'm really missing the role and rights of the father in this debate, and what it even means to be a father. This issue seems to go pretty much ignored, sadly enough.

"Many Pro-Choice activists Are Ableist, and I'm Tired of Pretending Otherwise","When Iceland bragged about ""erradicating"" Down Syndrome by aborting 100% of fetuses diagnosed with it, I remember and Icelandic newspaper accusing ""conservatives"" of being outraged by it, and saying how Iceland sees abortion as an ""individual decision"", even  though ableism still onfluences us. Sadly, it's not only Iceland where the majority of babies with DS are aborted: 98% in Denmark, 96% in Australia, 90% in England, 77% in France, 67% in US. Other conditions like spina bifida and intersex diagnoses, are also highly aborted. 

You can say it's based on individual choice, but is it really individual when, socially, disabled people are marginalized? In fact, a baby with Down Syndrome can be terminated at any moment of the pregnancy in UK, and the court decided against making the limit of abortion 24 weeks. Yet, most pro-choicers will deny the existence of bias in such abnormally high rates of abortion, and will accuse their critics of being ""anti-choice"", ""conservative"", etc., even if these people are themselves disabled.",t2_7q7no6ah,1637011878,prolife

My (sort of) Ex-Pro-Choicer story,"I think it would be unfair to call me an ‘ex-pro-choicer’. When I was younger, I tended to follow the crowd but abortion was just never really discussed or mentioned. At all. 

My earliest memory of abortion, I suppose I was about 10 or 11 at the time, was with a YouTube video. I was a cringy gacha life kid at the time, and there was this song trending called ‘Silent Scream’. I searched the song up on YouTube to watch some gacha videos of the song, as I liked it. Instead, a short (about 30 minutes) pro-life film of the same name came up. 

I decided to watch it. I can’t tell you why, but for some reason I did. I knew what abortion was, and this film did not introduce me to the concept, though I cannot remember from where I learnt what it was, but I was familiar with it enough to know what it meant. I can’t remember exactly the details of the film but I remember it was just going over fetal development and such. I was half watching it at the time. I remember reading the comments, and naturally there were many pro-lifers there in the comment section. Until I found one:

‘I’m still pro-choice, but this is really sad :(‘ 

That isn’t what it said, but it was close enough, I think it went on but I do not remember it. I do remember how I felt.

‘Pro-choice’?

Why that seemed perfect for me, I didn’t see it as pro-abortion, I thought it was a middle point between pro-abortion and pro-life. I smiled, happily adopting the label as my own. I went on to argue with multiple pro-lifers in the comment section. I don’t remember any of them replying to me, and I don’t remember what points I made in argument but I distinctly remember at one point typing the sentence ‘that’s why I’m pro-choice’ in response to a pro-life comment.

From them on I didn’t think about abortion much. The next memory I have is being at a table in my science class chatting with them and somehow the topic of abortion came up. We had a rubbish debate as nobody knew anything. One boy said ‘People say abortion isn’t murder, but if you kill a pregnant woman it’s double murder’. He wasn’t making a pro-life argument, none of us had positions in this ‘debate’. One girl then agreed ‘Yeah it’s murder, but it’s *legal murder*’. We all then nodded and agreed that this was a good point (despite it being horrendous in hindsight) and that abortion was justified. 

Some time after that, I ran into a tweet. A literal random screenshot of Twitter on the internet which stated ‘People say a fetus isn’t human, but that woman knows if she didn’t do it, in nine months she would have a baby in her arms’. Another terrible argument, but I remember reading that and just being convinced. Abortion was wrong. I am against abortion, anyway I’m hungry, what am I going to eat now-

I didn’t do much with it. Until I converted to Catholicism and that was a whole thing and I found out the Church was pro-life. That’s fine, so was I. Then, at a date I don’t remember my pro-life meter just shot up and I got really invoked in the movement. I joined this sub, I watched debates and now it’s a very big thing for me. Now I am pro-life fully. :)

So that’s my tale; boring. I still don’t really consider myself an ex-pro-choicer because I just assumed the label with no thinking. It’s not a powerful conversion, it’s not going to change hearts, but it’s mine and I love it :)

Oh and final note, I ended up getting into another abortion debate with the ‘legal murder’ girl and a slightly different crowd recently. It wasn’t a proper debate, as the main girl (not her, another) prefaced it by saying ‘don’t get into a debate or anything, but what’s your opinion on abortion?’. I told her and the legal murder girl said from the back ‘My opinion is, it’s the woman’s body, let her do what the f*** she wants with it’ though that was said more in jest than anger, but she meant it. So, she’s been got. Ah well.",t2_4ugckrj8,1636830027,prolife

"“If abortion is banned, what will you do with the 600k unwanted children?”","I have seen this argument a lot, but it is flawed for many reasons.

First of all, one of the reasons that there are so many abortions is because they are so easily available and liberals use them as a form of birth control rather than use condoms while having sex. 

Secondly, I think the bigger issue should be if you are not ready to have a child, you should not be ready to have unprotected sex. Every action you do in life should have a subsequent reaction.

Third of all, it is statistically proven that over 90% of women that do perform abortions regret them almost instantly. Taking a humans life is an unnatural thing. 

Lastly, if it so happens that the women actually does not one to have that child after the child is born, there is a large amount of data that shows families that cannot have children are often waitlisted for years before being able to have a child. They would be happy to adopt that innocent beautiful child.

Vaccine Mandates and Pro abortion stances are contradictory,"Before I begin, I am not making any claims about how safe and effective vaccines are, or whether or not you should receive one, and if you want that information, then reach out to your local doctor.

Pro-abortion advocates recently have come under a conundrum, as they preach that bodily autonomy is the most important right to hold while supporting a vaccine mandate that deliberately ignores the right to personal autonomy. However over the past few weeks they begin trying to rationalize how to support both options without being inconsistent so today we are going through all the ones I have seen or heard and testing if they hold up to scrutiny.

# Vaccine Mandates don't force you to get the vaccine.

Anti-abortion legislation does not force you to not get an abortion. You can still get an abortion albeit much more difficult and the possibility of getting caught and punished. This reasoning makes no sense as you, the pro abortion advocate, do want to be able to have abortions without fear of the consequences such as whatever the punishments come with anti-abortion legislation, so why are you simultaneously arguing that just because anyone else has a choice to get vaccine, that they should still be punished? Whether it's because our jobs fired us, or we can't attend public events the restrictions are still there. You say that you are free to choose to do whatever you want with your body when it comes to vaccines, but you must face the consequences of those actions while actively preaching that there should not be any consequences for your actions when you have an abortion.

While browsing for arguments to respond to I did come across another very important point someone made. This person was u/Pregnant_Silence and they said

 

&gt;Lawyer here. When people claim it is not a big deal to be denied service at restaurants, I like to remind them that the Civil Rights Act was upheld by the Supreme Court largely for that exact reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Everybody thinks that our federal non-discrimination laws are based on the Equal Protection Clause, but they are actually justified primarily by the Commerce Clause. Black Americans literally couldn't travel in the South because hotels and restaurants wouldn't serve them. This was the constitutional ""hook"" that Congress -- using its power to regulate interstate commerce -- used to pass the Civil Rights Act.  
&gt;  
&gt;So when you dismiss as frivolous people's complaints that an entire class of citizens are being shut out of the economy, just remember that would have put you on the absolutely wrong side of the Civil Rights Cases.

Now I am in no way saying that Vaccination Status is comparable to skin color, nor that vaccinated people are shut out from society. I am saying that mandates like the one Joe Biden passed are designed with that intention however. You either give up your autonomy or little by little you won't be able to work, go out and purchase, enjoy public spaces, etc.  So much so that the only thing you can do is stay home for the rest of your life or get the vaccine that you don't want. That is forcing you on a table and injecting you however that is not ""*choice*"" either. You're being **coerced** into this, and the optional testing, is keyword optional. Your job does not have to accept negative test results because of this bill. They can accept negative testing if they choose and if they don't, then you're out of luck. Businesses refusing to accommodate you was such a problem for Black Americans that the supreme court got involved.  

So to say that these mandates does not force anyone is disingenuous on the mere fact that if these restrictions were applied to abortions than there would be rioting in the streets.

Prolife argument from iVote," 

For many voters, a candidate’s position on abortion is a determining factor at the voting booth. After all, beliefs and actions regarding the right to life often indicate a candidate’s stance on other foundational rights. Whether the right to life should apply to our most vulnerable population, therefore, is a central question. 

Although politicians regularly try to spin their positions on many issues, the abortion debate is particularly clouded with arguments that confuse and mislead. Therefore, it is crucial to discern not only a candidate’s beliefs but also the objective truth – and know how to defend your positions to your friends, family, and even others at your church who may hold a different position and may have an open heart.

The central pro-life argument is very simple:

**A. It is wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being.**  
**B. Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being.**  
**C. Therefore, abortion is wrong.**  

With this in mind, let’s debunk two of the main arguments for abortion:

1. The unborn fetus is not a human being.
2. It’s my body, so it’s my choice.

Let’s look at these one at time.

**“The unborn fetus is not a human being.”**

While this belief is often *implied* rather than explicitly stated, it provides the underlying basis for most pro-abortion arguments.

Have you noticed that the arguments used to justify killing an unborn child are never used to justify killing a toddler? Why not? Because those in favor of abortion do not consider an unborn child to be a human like a toddler.  

But what is the unborn fetus if not a human being? Dr. C. Ward Kischer, former Professor Emeritus of Human Embryology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, points out that “every human embryologist, worldwide, states that the life of the new individual human being begins at fertilization (conception).”

If life begins at conception—as science demonstrates—then that life must be fully human. If not, at what point do we become human? If our humanity is not inherently tied to our existence, consider the implications: 

* If humanity depends on the **level of development**, should children not be considered human because they are still developing? 
* If humanity depends on the **degree of dependency**, what about toddlers, the elderly, or the severely disabled?
* If it depends on **self-awareness**, do people in a comatose state cease to be human?
* If it depends on **location**, can we kill a baby minutes before birth?

Placing the beginning of human life at any point other than conception leaves human rights on shaky ground—for us outside the womb as well as those in the womb. **It would mean that our humanity is not inherent, but** ***conditional.*** Therefore, it can be lost if certain conditions are met. If our humanity can be lost, so can our inalienable rights. 

Even if the unborn is regarded as a human being, however, many still argue that he or she has no right to the mother’s body. This is referenced by a second common pro-abortion argument:

**“My body, my choice”**

The slogan above is a major pro-abortion talking point. It attempts to cast abortion supporters as “pro-choice,” while framing supporters of life as “anti-choice.” For example, Planned Parenthood Action states:

*“Our ability to control our health, our bodies, and our future is at stake.”*

Pro-abortion talking points and policies often ignore the second human who is affected: the unborn baby. Therefore, we must ask, **how many bodies are involved**? Consider a C-section versus an appendectomy—is removing a baby from the mother equivalent to removing her appendix? 

Many abortion supporters acknowledge that the unborn baby is a separate entity from the mother.  Science confirms what common sense tells us, that the mother and the baby are distinct, different individuals with unique DNA.  Still, they argue that she shouldn’t be forced to use her body to support her developing baby; therefore, her right to abortion remains intact. **Is this a legitimate definition of rights?** **Doesn’t the fetus have rights?** Remember, if the unborn fetus is a human being, then he or she inherently possesses human rights, including the right to life and protection from assault and battery. 

If a mother has the right to harm or kill her baby in the name of bodily autonomy, it would logically follow that:

* A mother should be able to abort her baby at nine months instead of giving birth (which is technically legal in several states).  
* A mother should be able to abort her unborn girl because she wanted a boy (as many tragically did in order to preserve the family name during China’s one-child policy).
* If breastfeeding was a mother’s only available option to feed her newborn baby, she could refuse to use her body for that purpose, starving her baby in the name of bodily autonomy.

These horrific positions are where the “my body, my choice” argument ultimately leads.

In the end, always remember the basic argument: Intentionally killing an innocent human being is wrong.  Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being; therefore, abortion is wrong.  No claim to bodily autonomy will change a foundational truth.

**Abortion in the voting booth**

The abortion debate deals with questions of rights, humanity, and ethics—all of which should be primary considerations of anyone evaluating candidates or seeking public office. It is not, as some argue, simply a matter of religious preference which does not belong in public policy.

iVoterGuide is committed to helping you discover what your candidates believe about this fundamental issue. **The upcoming** ***Dobbs v. Jackson*** **Supreme Court case could potentially change the future of abortion laws in this country.** With that in mind, what will your 2022 primary candidates believe about the right to life, and how will that inform their actions if elected? These questions must be answered, and we are eager to help you answer them.

My question is this: if you truly believe embryos have the same rights as a fully-birthed/removed person, but are still aware that embryos are underdeveloped and need time and resources from the mother to be complete, then why should half the genetic material (ie. sperm) be allowed to go to waste?

I understand women’s bodies are purged of their genetic material each month, but as the process is painful and messy, I’m sure women wouldn’t mind opting out if they could. 

Men have the option to not purge any genetic material, yet they do, in the millions.

Cecily Strong's SNL 'clown abortion' skit had one word that perfectly encapsulates the evolution of the pro-choice movement.,"As many of you know, Cecily Strong had an SNL skit about 'clown abortions' that was quite cringy, in all honesty. She, however, had one phrase that seems to encapsulate the views of many pro-choice people in this country. Remember back in the 1990s when the phrase was 'Safe, legal, and *rare'? Well, according to Cecily Strong it is now 'Safe, legal, and *accessible*'. Why might this have changed? Perhaps, it is that when a *product* that a company sells has become less widely used, it is time to develop other tactics in order to market this product. Abortion rates have been on the decline since the 1980s. We are now at the lowest rate since then. (1) So, to compensate for this, we need to make abortion *more accessible* so that these companies have at least a small chance they won't completely lose their abortion revenue. Why else would the Governor of Illinois sign a bill *requiring most private insurance companies to cover abortion* in the Reproductive Health Act of 2019 (2) or why would the Democrats ditch the Hyde Amendment? (7) If abortion is becoming less widely used, why are Democrats on-stage arguing over late-term elective pregnancies? (3) Perhaps it is because of another reason. Maybe pro-choice activists are finally living up to their claim about bodily autonomy. After all, a fetus doesn't exit the mother's body at viability. Perhaps it is another reason. Bernie Sanders likes to talk about the 'Nordic Model' a lot. Let's talk about the abortion laws in the Nordic countries. Abortion is legal up to the 18th week in Norway, (4) the 18th week in Sweden (5) and the 12th week in Denmark. (6) Meanwhile in the US, Roe v Wade is 22-24 weeks. Maybe we'll never know why the Democrats are wanting to liberalize abortion laws when it is becoming *much less* widely used across the country, but I suspect it is for political purposes.

A question from a secular pro-choice non-US guy.,"Hi! First, I'd like to say I really enjoy the civil discussions that happen here and, as a guy who likes to keep an open mind and be constantly challenged, I find this an extremely enjoyable subreddit.

My question is specifically for U.S citizens. Why does abortion rank highly among the issues that sway voting in the U.S.? I understand this might be an emotional or a religious issue for some people, but I feel like there are kind of more pressing issues that would concern me if I was a U.S. voter. So if abortion is among your top three vote-swaying issues for you, could you please explain why it's more important than the following three issues: 

1- Climate chnage. As the second biggest CO2 emitter, the vote of a U.S. citizen seems to me to be way more important now than ever on this issue. The threat of climate change and the catastrophes that it's causing and will cause likely will kill thousands of lot of people and millions of animals in the future. Just last year the fires in Australia killed billions of animals. So wouldn't a this be a pretty pressing issue for a person who's prolife?

2- Getting money out of politics. As a guy who lives in a nondemocratic country, I think that preserving your democracy, which seems to be increasingly ineffective, and the politicians all seem to be bought by big corporations. So, for me, I find that protecting your democracy and ensuring that it stays healthy is way more important than fighting for your cause now because you might not be able to in the future. 

3- Making Healthcare/ education more affordable. I live in a third world country that is no where as rich as your country, and I pay way less taxes, and healthcare for me is way way cheaper than you. I'm stunned by how expensive basic medical procedures are in the U.S. Also, college here is free. So I find that it's extremely weird that a country as rich as yours can't get these basic rights that are essential to life to be widely accessible to everyone. I'm not saying they should be free, but at least accessible. 

I understand that it might be difficult for you to choose a candidate that fights for these issues but also be prolife, a major flaw in your two-party system if I might add. I also want to end by saying that I don't find the issue of abortion unimportant, but I'm merely asking why is it more important to you than these three issues, which, in my opinion, should be the most pressing issues for a person living in the U.S.",t2_g92ze,1636425591,prolife

Abortion doesn't seem like a right to me,"I've done my fair share of thinking.

If abortion was a right, then said ""right"" would be inalienable from the person who has it, but the American constitution is very clear about the extent of our rights; We have our rights inalienable up until those rights clash with another's. The way I see it, there is no right to prevent an alive but not yet conscious unborn child from attaining consciousness by their right to exist.

The womb is not a separator of rights.

Reasons cited for having an abortion --- let's design arguments to address these,"I see a lot of prolife arguments posted here, but they don't seem to address the main concerns.

## Common Abortion Reasons

Research collected from 2008 through 2010 asked women about the reasons for getting an abortion.1 Some listed multiple reasons for their decision. The reasons, and the percentage of women who gave each one, are:

* **Not financially prepared:** 40%
* **Bad timing, not ready, or unplanned:** 36%
* **Partner-related reasons (including the relationship is bad or new, she doesn't want to be a single mother, her partner is not supportive, does not want the baby, is abusive, or is the wrong guy):** 31%
* **Need to focus on her other children:** 29%
* **Interferes with educational or vocational plans**: 20%
* **Not emotionally or mentally prepared:** 19%
* **Health-related reasons (includes concern for her own health, the health of the fetus, use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, alcohol, or tobacco):** 12%
* **Want a better life for a baby than she could provide:** 12%
* **Not independent or mature enough for a baby:** 7%
* **Influences from family or friends:** 5%
* **Doesn't want a baby or to place the baby for adoption:** 4%

This survey used open-ended questions rather than having women select from a checklist of researcher-generated reasons. Previous surveys that had a set of answers got many responses for these reasons:

* Having a baby would dramatically change my life
* I have completed my childbearing
* Don’t want people to know I had sex or got pregnant

It's also interesting to point out that most women cite two to four reasons for abortion, not just one.

In general, younger women often cite that they are unprepared for the transition to motherhood, and older women consistently indicate that they are already respo

The Pro-life position will not prevail with morality: an essay,"I am somewhat new to the abortion issue, only really thinking about it seriously for the past couple years.  I have been going back and forth while doing research on this issue, starting out as pro-life but recently beginning to switch to pro-choice.  My analysis of the issue is that pro-life and pro-choice people seem to ultimately be talking past each other on the issue.  My understanding is that the abortion issue is ultimately a legal issue, and this is the interpretation that pro-choice people appear to have, arguing that abortion ought to stay legal, more so than arguing that abortion is necessarily morally right or wrong.  However, the pro-life position often seems to conflate the legal elements of the issue with its moral elements.  Prolifers always seem to talk in moral/ethical terms instead of talking in legal terms.  Prolifers say things like abortion is immoral, that it is murdering an innocent baby, that it is irresponsible to have sex out of wedlock, or to have sex without adequate contraception, or have sex promiscuously.  They talk a lot about women (and men) taking responsibility for their actions and not punishing an innocent baby with death for the misdeeds of its parents.  However, it seems that all of these points, while often valid, are *moral* points and not *legal* points.  At the end of the day, the abortion issue is not about whether abortion is immoral but about whether or not the government ought to have the prerogative to (1) forbid a woman from getting an abortion or (2) charge and sentence a woman for homicide after the fact for having acquired an abortion.  I think that is the heart of the issue, not whether abortion is immoral, or whether it is murder, or whether a ZEF is human, or when a ZEF becomes human, or whether a ZEF is a person, or any of the other various topics that often get brought up in this issue by people on both sides.

When discussing the abortion issue, it is important to keep in mind the true purpose of the government: to establish and maintain order in society.  And when government makes laws, it makes laws for the purpose of establishing and maintaining order.  This order is about keeping society structured, organized, stable, and in good condition.  In practical terms, this manifests in the form of the government attempting to do what is practical, efficient, and expedient for the prosperity and security of the country.  It is not the job of the government to regulate the moral choices of the people, per se, as this is outside the government's jurisdiction.

The thing is, morality is very different from order.  Morality is about understanding the perspective of one's place in the world.  It's about understanding that one's own desires, interests, and needs are no greater than those of others.  In short, morality is about not being selfish.  It means that I shouldn't steal from others because my prosperity is not more important than that of another.  I shouldn't cheat others because my interests are not more important than those of another.  I should not rape others because my own sensual gratification does not outweigh another's dignity and will.  I should not frame another man of a crime in order to spare myself, because my freedom is not more important than his.  I should not consign an innocent man to death to spare my own life, because my life is not more important than his.

But the thing is, morality is meant for individuals, but it does not really work with regards to the government.  The government has no choice but, with regards to the rest of the world, to be selfish and to put the interests of its own country above the interests of other countries.  Government is about maintaining order, but morality is not always orderly: it is not always practical or efficient or expedient; it does not always lead to one’s own prosperity or security.  Sometimes doing the right thing involves great cost, hard work, or sacrifice.  Morality is about respecting the interests of others with respect to the interests of the self; but when it comes to the government, the “self” manifests as the people.  For the sake of its people, a government cannot afford to be driven by morality; it cannot afford to force its people to sacrifice or be deprived or suffer for the interests of other nations or for the benefit of abstract idealism.

The government can make moral decisions insofar as is necessary to reflect the moral sensibilities of its constituents in order to appease them and keep the peace.  The government can also make moral decisions in the interests of maintaining appearances on the world stage, so as not to become too unpopular among the other nations and stoke political tensions that could jeopardize the country's security.  But in the end, these moral decisions are not done for their own sake, but for the sake of the country's internal order and interests.  This is the reason the US government has done things like attempting to murder troublemaking foreign politicians or allying itself with foreign tyrants and terrorist groups when it is deemed necessary to combat political rivals or protect the state's interests.  This is the reason that slavery in the US didn't end until after it had become less economically lucrative, and why the Constitution prolonged the slave trade for another twenty years, and contained a clause demanding the recovery of fugitive slaves.  It is the reason the US didn't get involved in WWII and the Holocaust until after the Pearl Harbor attack.  It is the reason why the government accepts the industry of factory farms and their inhumane treatment of animals for the sake of its efficiency and profitability.  It is the reason the courts sometimes grant freedom to known criminals for the sake of the integrity of the judicial system (e.g., Bill Cosby was released from prison through a legal technicality even though he is known for a fact to be a rapist).  The government must act in the interest of expedience, organization, and structure, not in the interest of conscience and virtue.  Morality is the jurisdiction of the people, not the government.  It's up to private individuals and private groups (like churches and charities) to engage in morality -- to do ""the right thing"" for its own sake.

For this reason, I would argue that the abortion issue, on a purely moral basis, is not truly within the jurisdiction of the government.  Pregnant women choosing to murder their own children *in utero* is not something that, in and of itself, directly concerns the government.  This could theoretically change if, for example, the national population began to dwindle to dangerously low levels, and therefore the government saw fit to institute an emergency ban on elective abortions for the purpose of boosting the birth rate.  But short of a situation like this, where society’s order would be in jeopardy, prohibiting abortion is still a moral stance that concerns the moral sensibilities of private parties and is not a stance that the government has any business fighting for.

Prolifers fight abortion on the basis that it is murder.  But murder is not really illegal because it's immoral.  The government makes laws based on two main reasons: one is in the interest of the public order and peace, and the other reason is simply that the people make requests to the government -- typically through the voting process -- to make laws that reflect the people's own values and sensibilities, regardless of whether the government itself cares about those issues.  Laws against murder are made for the same reasons that any laws are made: to maintain the public order and because the people demand laws against murder.  So in other words, all legislative action has either a regulatory motivation or an electoral motivation. Therefore either it is up to pro-lifers to determine whether it is in the interest of the government (and its civil obligation to fight disorder and unrest in society) to prohibit abortion, or it is simply up to pro-lifers to make enough of a fuss to motivate the government to prohibit abortion.

When prolifers criticize abortion on the grounds that it is murder, the fact is that this detail, if true, is technically irrelevant.  The murder of born people is illegal because it is antagonistic to the public order and because there is no significant sector of society that is in favor of or wishes to defend murder, therefore there is no public controversy regarding the murder issue – in other words, no one is voting in favor of defending the right to murder.

So it would seem that prolifers have two options to stop abortion.  The first is to simply make a large-enough fuss to the government to convince them to make the appropriate legislation.  But the problem with this is that, in the US, the pro-life and pro-choice sides of the population are roughly 50/50.  Therefore, the electoral motivation alone is probably insufficient.

The second option for prolifers is to clearly demonstrate to the government that abortion is antagonistic to public order and peace, and that prohibiting abortion is in the interest of public order and peace.   Prolifers make a big fuss about abortion being murder -- but so what if it is?  One might remember that there were a lot of innocent children being murdered in the Holocaust too, but the US government didn't do anything about it until it became politically expedient to do so.  Prolifers cannot merely explain why abortion is murder, but they must explain why abortion is a kind of murder that leads to public disorder and unrest within the country.

The second option would also appear to be an uphill battle.  Perhaps the most obvious reason for this would be that the abortion procedure is a necessary medical procedure if only in cases where the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, and thus, in the interest of the public health, abortion as a practice will never be completely eradicated.  And as a related example, as many prochoicers have argued over the years, if professional abortion were to be outlawed it would likely lead to a rise in either self-performed abortions or a rise in the black market abortion industry.  Such illegal abortion procedures would likely not be as skilled or sanitary as legal, professional abortions, and thus would result in a public health problem.

And more generally, the prohibition of abortion would lead to a surplus of unwanted children.  Statistically speaking, unwanted children disproportionately obtain less parental involvement and social support than wanted children.  They are often born to parents who are not prepared or qualified to raise children or attend to their children’s physical and mental health.  This in turn leads to these unwanted children growing up with more medical illnesses and being disproportionately inclined to delinquency.  More medical problems mean more of a strain on the medical care system; more delinquency means more civil disorder and unrest, and more of a strain on law enforcement, the court system, and the prison system.

Prohibiting abortion would lead to more problems associated with national overpopulation, straining the supply of resources and land.  Also, the increase in the population of unwanted children would put more of a strain on the foster system, and, statistically, individuals who come from the foster care system are more inclined to delinquency than those who don’t come from foster care.

Abortion is often used to eliminate unborn children who suffer severe disorders, deformities, or medical complications.  Allowing these children to live would ultimately prove to be a drain on the economy and the healthcare system.  Mentally handicapped children are one demographic that is commonly aborted during pregnancy; mentally handicapped people are relatively unlikely to grow up to acquire gainful employment, pay taxes, join the military, or otherwise significantly contribute to society.

My argument with these examples is not to say that it is morally good to abort unborn children belonging to these categories, or that it is not immoral to abort them. My point is simply that, apart from morality, a strong case could be made that there is no socially or politically expedient reason to prohibit the abortion of such children.

As I've alluded to before, one main difference between prolifers and prochoicers is that prolifers like to express how abortion is immoral but neglect the ways in which it is expedient, while prochoicers like to express how abortion is expedient but neglect the ways in which it is immoral.  However, between the two sides it seems that it's mainly the prochoicers that really speak the government's language.   My point here is not to argue for the pro-choice side.   My point is to point out what I see as a somewhat flawed approach of the pro-life side.  Because the abortion issue is a legal issue and not a moral issue, I don't believe the government really has any basis to prohibit abortion on purely moral grounds.  Therefore, it seems to me that instead of exclusively fighting against abortion with arguments fueled by righteous indignation, another weapon that should be added to the pro-life arsenal is to demonstrate the ways in which the end goal of the pro-life stance is in fact practical, expedient, and profitable.  Prolifers should demonstrate the concrete and quantifiable benefits of prohibiting abortion rather than merely seeking to uphold abstract ideals.  They should seek to prove that society is happier, more prosperous, more efficient, and overall better-off when unborn people are not being murdered.

Secular Pro-lifers - what are your arguments?,"It's probably been discussed here often, but I'm seeing these pictures and website posted recently, and it makes me wonder - how do you justify your anti-abortion viewpoint without the appeal to an ultimate authority (as Christians do)?

Some issues I see:

* Your opinion is just as valid as a pro-choicer's - you can't justify telling them that they're wrong
* Humans are just 'spacedust' - life has no real value, unless purely utilitarian, though even that is ultimately pointless in the grand scheme of things
* Humans are just animals - hard to justify being anti-abortion while being non-vegan

I guess you can argue that life begins at conception, but many pro-choicers will agree and just say that it doesn't matter because they can't feel anything anyway. And also, if you're just anti-killing-humans, it's hard to justify being pro-death-penalty, for example.

I don't want to create a division, but I'm genuinely curious how you justify your opinion yourself, and especially what your arguments are when talking to pro-choicers.",t2_n6n3b,1636241701,prolife
"Consent Requires a ""Consenter"" and ""Consentee""","I have always assumed that any instance of consent, from a legal standpoint, requires someone who receives consent (consentee) and someone who gives consent (consenter). A non consensual act would then imply that the would-be consentee did not ask for or was turned down consent and that the would-be consenter either did not give or rejected consent.

It seems to me that this implies a consentee must be capable of asking for consent. However, no legal definition of consent appears to look at both consenter and consentee. Instead, it only looks at the consenter and whether or not they can give consent.

As a result of this vagueness, pro-choicers use this to argue that they may give or withdraw consent to anything regardless of whether the ""performer"" of the consented action can ask for consent (i.e., ""giving consent"" for tumors to grow, and then ""withdrawing consent"" when seeking treatment).

Anyone know of any quality websites that discuss the ""consentee's"" role in consent, or does this concept not exist in the legal system?",t2_m9rkgpg,1636231588,prolife

Abortion and Murder,"I have a story, not my own, but fascinating in a weird way.

Here's the story.

This is a story from a middle school teacher, let's call her Amy. About 14 years ago, Amy had a student, let's call him Willy.  So Willy comes to the teacher and says, ""I need to tell you something.""

Amy says, ""Well go on and say it.""

""It's private,"" Willy confides.

So they walk out of class into the hallways and he continues. ""I think I got my girlfriend pregnant.""

Amy a bit shocked, acknowledges ""Alright,"" wondering what this is leading towards.

Willy takes a breath in, and searchingly asks, ""If I give my girlfriend bleach water will that kill the baby?""

""No, that will kill your girlfriend and the baby.""

""But what if it's a small amount like a capful?""

""No, that will still kill them both.""

The conversation ended and it never came up again. Now, fourteen years later, an acquaintance of Willy's is texting with Amy. And she tells Amy, ""Did you know that Willy's in jail now? For murder.""

""Why? I mean, How? What happened?""

""Well, he tried to rob a store. He shot three people. Two of them died but thankfully one survived. Now Willy's serving a life sentence.""

End of story.

I don't think those who seek elective abortions are typically murderous in intent.

I just never thought specifically, of a scenario such as this. A boy wanting to cause an abortion for his girlfriend grows up to commit murder.

I still won't say abortion is murder except as a slogan. But to me, this story is more of demonstrating that we can't help but see the connection at least for the Willy's of the world and their misguided heads.

"If the history of the pro-life position is a reason to reject the position, then the intellectual origin of Planned Parenthood is enough to reject the pro-choice position.","The audacity of certain authors to talk about the ""racist"" origins of the pro-life movement, while simultaneously ignoring the origins of Planned Parenthood (i.e. Margaret Sanger, eugenics) amaze me. (1)(2)(3) Additionally, even Planned Parenthood admits that Sanger was a white supremacist, so why aren't we renaming streets named after her and removing her statues? We are rightfully going after racist human slave holders such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, why not her next? Because the left doesn't want to be honest about people on ""their side in history,"" the Washington Post has pinned a lovely article entitled, ""Instead of toppling statues, recognize history's complexity.""(4) Now, of course this ""complexity"" is only granted when the oppressor agreed with lots of our viewpoints and wasn't ""that bad."" It stands to reason that our political viewpoints must bend the arc towards justice. Planned Parenthood uses messages like, ""abortion is empowerment"" and ""reproductive freedom is justice served."" Empowerment from what, may I ask? Abortion does not alleviate poverty. It certainly doesn't help with financial stability. It seems the ultimate oppressor in life is the one who confuses you as to who the true oppressor is.

An unbeatable argument in favor of slavery,"""Howdy, I'm Randy and as a plantation owner I just found this new argument that ***justifies slavery!*** So I'm gonna share it with you!

Okay so essentially I've asked people this and they haven't been able to rebut me, so slavery must be okay!

I was debating the ""personhood"" of African people and I found this one thing that all those silly abolitionists can't deny. I said ""Does a black person have a different skin color?"" And they admitted that ""yes they do"". See! I told you black people and white people are **different**! Therefore it follows that black people are sub-human and slavery is okay! Not even the abolitionists can deny there's differences, after all this whole debate isn't about ""human rights"" it's about ruin business for us southerners! Slavery should always and will always remain a private decision between a state legislator and a businessman!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now obviously **I don't believe that** (although how much do you want to bet someone from the prochoice sub is going to screenshot and cross post this - reading things fully isn't exactly their forte)

I bring this up because in a lot of debates with pro-choicers people think that they have to prove that the unborn and born are the **same**. The truth is they're **not** and that's okay. In the same way that a toddler is different from a teenager whose different from an elderly person. Or how an architect is different from a chef. People have differences, in this debate it's not about proving that ""**no differences exist**"" it's about proving that ""**no difference that exists matters in terms of right to life**"".

I see so many times pro-choice people who think that they've got the best argument in the world because they found **a** difference. When in reality the crux of a good argument isn't finding **a** difference but explaining **why** a difference **matters**.

Yeah the unborn are smaller, why does that matter? Humans are a multitude of sizes throughout their development. Yes the unborn lack certain organs at stages of development, again since when has humanity been tied to what organs you have? Yes they can't feel pain, again when have we said it's okay to harm people who are under anesthetic/naturally can't feel pain? Etc etc.

So that's my little word of advice, don't think that you have to prove that they're **completely the same**. You just have to prove that they're **human and alive** (a.k.a basic biology) and that no matter what differences exist **they don't matter** in terms of **right to life**.",t2_9ev60ea5,1636111261,prolife

*Sentience* is defined to be feeling **or** sensation as distinguished from perception and thought. Which PCers tend to claim that a fetus cannot inhabit any characteristics so it does not deserve the right to life. But my situation is this.

"(Not my post, from debate forum) Do PLers believe all women who want abortions actually want to be pregnant?","This post is not mine, it's from a pro-choicer on the debate forum.  I'll answer the questions posed by the pro-choicer who made the thread.


    I have had several conversations with PLers in the past week or so where it seemed clear that the person I was talking to genuinely did not believe that women who want abortions *really don’t want* to be pregnant.

    I’m getting the sense that some PLers think that all women would in fact choose not to abort, if only they were offered the right “resources,” informed that adoption exists, or perhaps told that abortion is ""Killing a baby.""

    There's also the whole ""consent to sex is consent to pregnancy"" argument, which insists that *all* women who have sex in fact want to be pregnant.

    My feelings on that are,

    1. There are not enough “resources” in the world to convince me not to abort, and I’m sure many, many people feel the same way; [there’s a whole sub for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/)
    2. We all know that adoption exists, thanks, we don’t need you guys to tell us
    3. The whole point of abortion is that we do not want a baby. (Also that we don’t want to be pregnant in the first place; otherwise we’d adopt it out. In reality only [1% of people do that).](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/why-more-women-dont-choose-adoption/589759/) Telling people it’s a baby will only make some of us want to abort more.
    4. If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, please explain why people use contraception or why anyone wants an abortion.
    5. Another sense I get is that some PLers believe that because women list other reasons than “I do not want to be pregnant” on surveys about their reasons for abortion, that they actually *do* want to be pregnant.

    **There are a few things wrong with the assumptions PLers make (especially no. 5).**

    1. These studies rarely ask ""do you just not want to be pregnant?"" It's not even an option on the survey.
    2. They probably don't ask that because it's an absurd question to ask. Researchers know that most people getting abortions don't want to be pregnant. They want to know why.
    3. However, ""I don't want to be pregnant because \[I want to focus on my career\] \[I don't want to have a baby with this unreliable guy who got me pregnant\] \[I'd rather devote my limited resources to my current children\] \[etc\]"" is still *not wanting to be pregnant.*

    For instance, I could list on my questionnaire that I’m getting an abortion because having a baby would interfere with my career. Even if PLers made it so that I had, I dunno, free daycare, I would *still* not want a baby because I would *still* want to focus all my energy on my career.

    Also, some of these aren’t things PLers can fix. Are you really going to pay each and every pregnant woman a per diem of, let’s say $3k a month until the child turns 18, plus all medical expenses, college tuition etc. so she can afford not only to have a baby, but to give the child the life she wants to give it?

    Are you going to kill her ex so she doesn’t have to tie herself to some unreliable or abusive dude via a child? These problems are too big for you to solve.

    **Questions for PLers:**

    Do you genuinely believe that everyone with a uterus secretly wants to be pregnant? Even those who want abortions? What is the basis for your reasoning?

    If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, why do you suppose people want abortions? Why does anyone use contraception for that matter?

    3. The whole point of abortion is that we do not want a baby. (Also that we don’t want to be pregnant in the first place; otherwise we’d adopt it out. In reality only [1% of people do that).](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/why-more-women-dont-choose-adoption/589759/) Telling people it’s a baby will only make some of us want to abort more.
    4. If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, please explain why people use contraception or why anyone wants an abortion.
    5. Another sense I get is that some PLers believe that because women list other reasons than “I do not want to be pregnant” on surveys about their reasons for abortion, that they actually *do* want to be pregnant.

    **There are a few things wrong with the assumptions PLers make (especially no. 5).**

    1. These studies rarely ask ""do you just not want to be pregnant?"" It's not even an option on the survey.
    2. They probably don't ask that because it's an absurd question to ask. Researchers know that most people getting abortions don't want to be pregnant. They want to know why.
    3. However, ""I don't want to be pregnant because \[I want to focus on my career\] \[I don't want to have a baby with this unreliable guy who got me pregnant\] \[I'd rather devote my limited resources to my current children\] \[etc\]"" is still *not wanting to be pregnant.*

    For instance, I could list on my questionnaire that I’m getting an abortion because having a baby would interfere with my career. Even if PLers made it so that I had, I dunno, free daycare, I would *still* not want a baby because I would *still* want to focus all my energy on my career.

    Also, some of these aren’t things PLers can fix. Are you really going to pay each and every pregnant woman a per diem of, let’s say $3k a month until the child turns 18, plus all medical expenses, college tuition etc. so she can afford not only to have a baby, but to give the child the life she wants to give it?

    Are you going to kill her ex so she doesn’t have to tie herself to some unreliable or abusive dude via a child? These problems are too big for you to solve.

    **Questions for PLers:**

    Do you genuinely believe that everyone with a uterus secretly wants to be pregnant? Even those who want abortions? What is the basis for your reasoning?

    If consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, why do you suppose people want abortions? Why does anyone use contraception for that matter?

"Found out I’m pregnant a week and a half ago, my own mom is guilting me into terminating. I don’t want to.","I have a 2 year old daughter who is the love of my life. Right before I had her, I had an apartment closer to the city which worked fine for me but was not ideal for myself and a child- so my mom insisted that I move in with her and I did about a week before going into labor. It was just me and my mom for about a year, but it was always understood that she intended to move in with her longtime partner and eventually when that happened I would stay in her home with my daughter and she would rent it out to me at a discounted rate. But one day, she told me that we were all moving in with her partner because they had bought a large home that would accommodate up to 9 people. She also told me that I couldn’t stay at her house because she needed to charge more in rent to mitigate the very high price tag of the new home. So I was left with no option but to go.

Almost 2 weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant with baby number 2. I had no idea because I don’t get regular periods, I had no symptoms (with my first I was sick from 4 weeks on), and I was on birth control. But I took the test, went to the doctor, and found out I was 14.5 weeks pregnant. I am now 16 weeks. I was surprised and upset at first, but that turned into happiness quickly. I knew my mom would be shocked, but not angry- I was more concerned about her partners reaction.

So I told my mom last night and she told me point blank that I need to get an abortion. She said she could not take on helping me with another baby and that it would be the end of her relationship with her partner because he would not be okay with having another baby around. She is now telling me that it’s bad for me, bad for her, bad for my daughter, bad for everyone. She keeps telling me to make a decision while saying the only decision I have support on is to terminate. Adoption is a no because whether she wants to admit it or not, she is image oriented and wouldn’t want to explain why her daughter is giving a baby up when she has 5 spare rooms. I don’t want to terminate all, but I have no idea how to navigate getting out of this situation and frankly the only reason I’m in this situation to begin with is because she insisted I live with her to begin with. Yes, my apartment was smaller than her home and yes, all of this would have been harder to do without her- but I’m just at a loss right now. Advice please.",t2_b1jccjjv,1635785426,prolife
"Hello! I am a firm believer in pro-choice and I have some questions for y’all, but no hate needed it’s just questions.","My first question is, if a 13 year old girl is raped by a man shouldn’t she have the right to not have the child considering the pain of child birth and the guilt of having said child?
My second question is would it be saving a life if there was no life in the fetus? The fetus while yes, develops major organs on week 6 the organs don’t work until week 7, so if you got an abortion then it wouldn’t be killing a baby. An example is like eating an egg, yes a chicken can come out of it but it wasn’t developed so you aren’t eating a baby chicken.
And the third question is, since the world will eventually end wouldn’t some abortions help the overpopulation problem if the fetus was a so called “life”
And the fourth question is, why protest to be fully pro life when you have the choice to not have an abortion, you have that choice to keep the baby so why protest to stop it when people getting abortions don’t affect you directly?
And fifth, Why say you want to save lives and then ignore children suffering in the foster care system?",t2_4m5bnaln,1635783098,prolife

Pro-choicer trying to understand the pro-life perspective,"Hi there I'm a prochoicer trying to gain a greater understanding of the pro-life perspective.

I'm looking to learn more about pro-life thoughts and beliefs about the fetus and some other beliefs.

1. I was wondering if you think from conception the Zef is a person?

2. Also do you believe in souls &amp; do you think from conception a zef has a soul or at some other point?

3. Do you think a fetus experiences pain and/or suffering during an abortion? Say a 8 week abortion? Or a 15 week? (Just random numbers I chose).

4. Do you think the fetus is aware of the abortion and panics or feels scared/afraid? Or no?

5. Do you think poor people shouldn't have children? What do you think about people who can't afford children getting pregnant by accident or on purpose?

6. How do you feel about poor people, do you think they are innately inferior from the rich in some way? Or are they the same value and similar qualities?

7. How do you feel about disabled people who likely couldn't look after their children? Do you think they shouldn't have kids or should be prevented from having kids?? 

8. How do you feel about people having kids either by accident or deliberately if they know the child will inherit a bad genetic disease? Say like polycistic kidney disease. Do you think they should try not to have kids or should they be prevented?

Would you support legislation to punish women who have abortions?,"I was having a conversation with my brother about abortion. He's Pro-Life and was saying that he believes abortions should be illegal since in his point of view, the unborn should have the same rights as any other human. I asked him if women who obtain abortions should be punished, and he said no. My impression is that most people who hold a Pro-Life stance agree with this. 

However, it seems like a logical contradiction. If you really believe that abortion is murder (on the same level as someone killing a toddler) should women who seek out abortions be charged with, at a minimum, being an accessory to murder? Put another way, are the unborn entitled to the same rights and expectation of Justice as is given to any other person?",t2_ft92h,1635282896,prolife

Going after women for having a miscarriage.... where do you draw the line?,"So recently, the story of the native american woman who was jailed for having a miscarriage made it here.  I noticed that a bunch were cheering her sentence and others thought it went too far.  

The question is... if more states grant a fetus ""personhood,"" where do you draw the line?  

In one of those threads I used the scenario of a pregnant women who was driving her husband's classic 1960's muscle car and got hit by a redlight runner which caused her to lose the unborn fetus.  The people who responded said it would be the result of the redlight runner.  But let's say said woman was driving a modern car with all the modern safety features and because she was running late for work she was doing 55 in a 45 and on the way got hit by a distracted driver.  She loses the baby.  Would you really charge her simply because she was speeding?  Remember it's a moving violation that's a ticketable offense only, not an arrest-able one (Unless you're doing something crazy like that Tesla driver recently who decided to use a residential street as an impromptu dragstrip).

I came across a comment on facebook recently that said, ""Doctors will tell pregnant women to avoid eating processed foods like lunch meats, etc.  So if i decide to cheat and eat a sub from Jimmy Johns and three days later suffer a miscarriage does that mean I can go to jail for eating a sandwhich?""  

If a pregnant woman still likes lifting weights well into her pregnancy but one day loses grip, the bar falls on her belly and she ends up miscarrying should she really be charged for the crime of.... trying to stay healthy?

If a pregnant women is in the shower, slips, falls and lands hard enough to where she sadly has a miscarriage should she be charged if a prosecutor finds out that she didn't have an anti-skid mat installed on the shower floor?",t2_chul40k,1635185225,prolife

Things Pro-Choicers Say,"Every so often I let people debate me or tell me some wacko stuff they believe. Bit of fun, especially because I believe some wacko stuff. Hell, check out my profile. Strangely enough, the one thing people seem most interested in is debating abortion with me. I've picked up on a few things. 

Pro-choicers never seem to know why they're pro-choice. They can only give vague reasoning like ""i support women"" and ""cause it's a clum of cells lol"". They legitimately do not know why they believe what they believe. I usually ask at what point in the pregnancy would they abortion is wrong and they don't know. They can never answer. Why debate abortion without knowing your own stances on abortion? It's so odd. 

Not a single pro-choicer I've spoken to seems aware of how abortions are performed. When I told one it was performed by crushing the ""cell's"" skull then tearing apart their limbs they seemed to believe I was telling them some big lie I heard online. Another laughed at me for thinking it's a person when it can feel itself being ripped apart (but that's fine, cause it's not a ""person""). 

Despite everyone I've spoken to believing that abortion is fine as a means of birth control they always try to use the rape/incest argument when those make up for less than 5% of abortion cases. It's extremely dishonest. 

Overall, they seek out arguments about abortion despite knowing nothing about the topic. Are these real life programmable NPCs?",t2_ed96c4ad,1635180050,prolife
My abortion story.,"I fell in love with this guy in high school. I loved him and thought he loved me too. We've been dating for years. One time his parents were out of town and he invited me over. I accepted super excited. But it was a mistake. It was OK at first. We talked, ate pizza, watched dumb horror movies, and took personality quizzes online. We started watching a romance movie. We cuddled on the couch and kissed. Eventually kissing turned into making out and making out turned to...y'know. I was overwhelmed with excitement after. I was a teenager and my hormones were all over the place. After 3 weeks I've been getting sick in the morning and I had to urinate often, I had heartburn, weird food cravings, and I realized I missed my period! I was so scared a confused! I searched it up and it said I was pregnant! I. WAS.HORRIFIED! I tried to calm myself down. ""It's ok deep breaths...I'll buy a pregnancy test with my allowance...I can't believe everything the internet tells me..."" I brought a pregnancy and ignored the disapproving glances the man gave me. It said I was pregnant! I was so scared! I threw it in the trash! But when my mom took the trash out she found it! She got really mad and demanded to know the father. After I told her she called my boyfriend and of course, he bailed. I was really sad and didn't know what to do.

How to argue the lifelong physical effects of pregnancy on a woman?,"A woman in my family was talking recently about how pregnancy was the hardest thing on her body. Not only was the pregnancy extremely difficult (many issues including preeclampsia), but during labor the baby ripped her from nearly her vagina to her anus. She said the doctor stitched her back up but sex was never enjoyable after that because she feels she was overstitched. She also has problems where she has difficulty holding her urine in. 

This has made me terrified to give birth, especially because this was coming from someone who I am related to (and is a similar build to me). As bad as it sounds, the worst part to me was the part where she said sex was never the same again and often painful. Obviously the baby never did any of this on purpose, but it’s though to imagine someone being forced to go through this pain. Especially if she was raped. 

We can kill someone if we feel threatened in our homes (even if the person threatening is mentally ill and unaware of what they are doing), but a first trimester abortion where the woman is terrified for her safety by someone in her body is immoral?

Should all women be permitted to reproduce?,"Some conditions, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and age, carry with them a not insignificant risk of either miscarriage or health issues for the fetus and baby once born.

There are many genetic conditions that make miscarriage very likely or have the high likelihood of passing a serious condition to the child.

You are not allowed to bring a child into an unsafe situation. For example, I cannot even smoke in the car with a child in the car with me. 

For example, having a BMI of greater than 25% (not really fat) has roughly a 20-30% increased risk of miscarriage. No one would say it is OK to put a child in a situation that increases their likelihood of dying by even a few percent (miscarriage risk is estimated at over 40% for a healthy fetus in optimal situations, so even on the low end this means we're increasing the risk of death by at least 5% which is huge).

How can we justify bringing a fetus into an unsafe situation, be it a mother who is obese or has some other health issue, that poses very significant risk to the fetus?

Should women who are aware of these issues not be permitted to reproduce? Why or why not?

Bonus question: should these women be permitted to having heterosexual intercourse at all? Certainly any chance of conceiving will be immoral, so should we also not ban them from having sex with men who are fertile?",t2_ej7qdrts,1635168001,prolife
Bodily Autonomy is a red herring for the reasons behind most elective abortions.,"This is not counting abortions that are coerced or done to save the mother's life. Anyway...

We're all aware of the bodily autonomy argument that belies justification of most elective abortions, that no one may make a woman gestate her baby against her will. This implies that most of the reasons for abortion have to do with pregnancy itself.

However, this is usually NOT the case. Most of the anxiety about being pregnant are (appropriately) about what the mother will do with her baby after they're born. She's got college and doesn't have the time or money to care for a baby, or she already is stretched thin with her other children.

The reason underlying most elective abortion is that the mother wants to dictate whether her baby lives or dies. Even if, hypothetically, there were an artificial womb or a willing surrogate available at no cost and no risk to the mother or her baby, most seeking abortion would rather have the abortion.

This is, needless to say, incredibly wrong.",t2_m9rkgpg,1635167617,prolife

"An Example of Mass Misinformation on Reddit, a good reminder never to use it for news, ever.","
An example of a post-truth system of humans gaining opinions:

Story according to the Hill: Women has a fetus who dies pre-birth after she takes coke. Supposedly doctors believed this was unrelated, but coroner also confirms baby had coke inside it. She has been charged with manslaughter. Even if she wasn’t, the baby would be deeply medically hurt by her drug use, I have little doubt on that.

Someone in a news room undoubtably found this provocative and that’s why it’s in front of anyone’s eyes. It’s a story which sells.

Note: No search word in google, yahoo or bing was able to help me find the Comanche nations abortion laws. EVERY SINGLE article I looked around for about this subject had the same issue: they called this an Oklahoma law problem when the Comanche nation did have the full legal right to affect this outcome (argued in https://harvardlawreview.org/2021/02/tribes-can-prohibit-abortions-in-indian-country/). If the Comanche nation has abortion laws, they’d get deference in this case. It’s appears they did not.

Result: Reddit post with over 25K upvotes, maybe real or fake, and could undoubtably have been egged in by foreign partisans. It is as of right not on top of r/all from r/news, stating a women was sent to prison for four years on a murder charge for a miscarriage, ignoring the coke issue, and that the GOP has created a Fascist Theocracy. Top comment proclaims the racism of the ruling, as the women was Native American.

Special relationship questions,"Most prolifers agree nobody can use your body without your consent (rape, forced organ donation, etc)

And you aren't forced to donate any organs even if you put them in that position (car crash, smoking, etc)

Except for a fetus, because it's your child so they have ""special privileges"" to you.
 
So here's some questions:

Why does the fact that it's your child matter? When does the child lose any special privileges they have? 

What if it's not YOUR child? Very far out question but what if an embryo not related to you was implanted? Is the abortion still as wrong? Why? 

Do you have anything against adoption? Does a child also have a special privilege to taken care of by the one who gave birth?

This is the true horror of abortion in the USA. Abortion up to birth can be accessed in several states. A pregnant mother can have her baby murdered without any reason other than she wants to.

There is no limit on abortion. Between 5,000-10,000 unborn babies slaughtered every Saturday. Roughly 2500 unborn boys and girls are slaughtered during every week in the USA. Abortion is protected by force of law, enforced by armed police and funded by government. There is no limit on the number of her babies a pregnant woman can murder and no limit on the number of women who do so. It is a river of babies’ blood, a cataclysm of murder, a bottomless pit of evil.

"Hey guys , I believe in baby murder. What do you think?","AKA abortion. I think the society would be better off if we killed unwanted and unborn babies. I also support the idea that protection of life begins only on birth. 

I don't approve or encourage it but I think the society would be better off with it. Not aborting unborn babies will result in: 

a) More fatherless children (which I guess you're against)

b) More unemployment

c) More burden on welfare system

d) More crime. 

e) Teenage motherhood. 

In addition , abortion bans rarely work. Nearly all countries that criminalise abortion (or atleast Latin America specifically) have much higher rates of baby murder than liberal western countries that allow it.

What are the beliefs of pro life,"I have posted this on abortiondebate, but I want to also ask here to not miss the entirety of the answer.

Hello, proclaimed pro lifers.

I am currently in the mental hospital, so I may miss the within 24h reply window for answering posts. Please excuse me.

Proclaimed pro lifers, what is your position on life? Many of you seem to be anti life, as long as you get the anti abortion stance passed, you dont care who dies.

Do you know of the furry dilemma? The furries were a group that preached acceptance of everyone, no matter what. Naturally, they got some freaks calling themselves furries unopposed. The furries didnt like how cruel and inconsiderate these ""furries"" were, but didnt call them out for being absolute beasts having public sex and defecating at public cons and generally spreading a horrible reputation for furries and also throwing bestial porn at the unwilling... Eventually, the furries wised up and did self discipline within their group and started actively calling out all the ""furries"" who violated boundaries, harmed people, and went against what furries believed about kindness for everyone....

But furries still have a horrible reputation.

This is what you pro lifers have, at the moment. What exactly do you believe? Because I encounter pro lifers here on reddit that viciously declare how women should just die, and its no problem if the children starve to death as long as they are forced to be born, and all sorts of hateful things... and its very very rare that a pro lifer will disagree.

It leads me to believe that anyone calling themselves prolife is against women, delights in the death of women, and enjoys the existence of children who starve to death, and loves when born children who are abused/killed. They dont care about anyones life, as long as that anyone is born, and if that anyone isnt born for whatever reason the woman needs to go to jail or die.

What are the beliefs of the prolife postion?  And if they arent as i understand and have explained above, why do you tolerate such hateful people in your community?",t2_4l60okvb,1634903450,prolife

"If an embryo is the same as a born child, then can't women give up custody of embryos like they can born children?","I'm pro-choice, but I will grant you that life begins at conception and even that a single cell embryo has the same moral equivalence as a 3-year-old child for this argument.

If a woman decides she can no longer care for her 3-year-old child, she has the right to forfeit custody of the child, and the child will become a warden of the state eligible for adoption. The life of the child becomes the responsibility of the state after the woman gives up custody.

If an embryo is equal to that 3-year-old child, then she also has the right to forfeit custody of the embryo, and the embryo then becomes the responsibility of the state, to incubate and care for until the embryo is ready for adoption. The life of the embryo becomes the responsibility of the state after the woman gives up custody.

If the embryo isn't viable or doesn't survive incubation, that is the fault of the state or of medical technology, but it is no longer the responsibility of the woman. And the doctor that performed the procedure is just an intermediary between the woman and the state, and also isn't responsible for the life of the embryo. 

In addition to the protections afforded to women by the 14th Amendment for abortions, custody law also allows a woman the legal right to choose to forfeit custody of her child at any point. So even if I accept that life begins at conception and there's no difference between an embryo and a born child, abortion will be legal because of custody law. Do you support custody law and the state carrying the responsibility for unwanted children?",t2_5a4pymi9,1634752366,prolife

Has it ever made sense to any of you how pro-choicers tend to shame virgins?,"Okay, so I just came from another post where this was referenced, but I feel like it needs to be fleshed out a bit in a different post so any of your thoughts could be condensed here. So first, we all have to accept and understand how modern feminism has tried to weave abortion as a part of their dogma as well as being heavily against ""slut-shaming"". Right? But why is it now that every single time you see someone disagree with abortion if you're a woman you get shame cast on to you and people assume you've never had sex. I forgot what comedienne it was, but I remember reading something about how she basically said that, ""if you're someone whose made it to their death without ever having had an abortion, you're either a man or you haven't been laid very much."" As if 1) abortion is an intrinsic part of womanhood, which it's not, majority of women don't get an abortion in their lifetime, 2) people, both pro-life and pro-choice, man and woman, *choose* abstinence for many different reasons, and 3) acting as if it's some kind of big own to say basically ""haha someone's been sexually responsible, they're not a part of the sisterhood!"" or making a woman feel as if not having an abortion or rampant sex is some exclusionary quality. 

And then there's the matter for if you're a man and you're pro-life and you vocalize this. I cannot stand the amount of ""feminists"" that simultaneously say we shouldn't shame women for sleeping around when men ""started"" that behavior, (even tho it takes two to tango), and then try to act like they care for men and say that ""there's pressure on men to act a certain way too :,("" and that we shouldn't shame them if they don't have sex and then two f\*cking seconds later, when a man says that they don't think that abortion is right the first thing they go to call him is an Incel. And if not that, they insult him based on the size of his d\*ck, or if he has any balls, they insult his masculinity and manhood. I guess it's a similar thing with women and the pick-me thing but on a bigger scale because modern feminists lose their shit when someone says something less than praise of a woman, but will also be some of the first people to be the most vocal about shaming men and encouraging others to do so. 

I'm not going to deny the certain double standards surrounding sex between men and women, but I will in fact be one to call out bullsh\*t when I see it.",t2_c7ceyaem,1634739433,prolife

I offered to support them with money and other help. But the topic quickly turned to abortion.

I treaded lightly, reminding her that we were prolife, but nothing she could do would change our love for her. She made her choice. She was sick for days afterwards. She stayed with us while she recovered.

I kept a brave face the whole time. But something broke in me today. I was reading a blog post about abortion and I couldn't stop thinking about that little baby and how I would never see her.

I ran to the bathroom and turned on the water hoping my wife wouldn't hear me sobbing. I fell on my knees and cried and cried. I never met her, but I love her and I miss her every day.

If only 3% of Planned Parenthood's services are abortion then what's the big deal? A reasoned response.,"General claims made by Planned Parenthood supporters:

1.  Planned Parenthood wants to help women.
2. Planned Parenthood provides many services other than abortion.
3. In fact abortion only constitutes 3% of all Planned Parenthood's services.
4. Without government funding Planned Parenthood would suffer significant economic hardship and would have to cut services.

Analysis:

1. If Planned Parenthood lost government funding this would seriously harm is ability to ""help"" women.  
2. 97% is greater than 3%.  Thus, its reasonable to assume 97% of the non abortion services help more women than 3% of abortion services.   
3. Abortion is the root of the funding controversy.

Conclusion:

1. In a dilemma, it is reasonable to choose the good of the many vs. the good of a few.
2. Eliminating abortion services harms some women  but cutting back on other services (97% of the budget) harms far more women.
3. Therefore, if Planned Parenthood insists on providing abortion services they are recklessly endangering the health and well being of many more women then they are ""helping"".",t2_buwlkam7,1634700849,prolife

Conflicted emotions. Pro-choicer who is uncomfortable with abortion: my testimony,"7 years ago I had an abortion very early in the pregnancy. I was a sophomore in college. 

I may lose some of you with this sentence: I will have episodes where I cry and feel like a monster, but other days I feel like what I did wasn’t so bad.

If I had that child, he/she would have likely been without a father long-term. He/she wouldn’t have been born into a loving family. I strongly considered adoption, but a part of me feared that the father would want to keep the child in order to keep me in his life. I was afraid because I didn’t know him well enough to trust him as a father of my child, and this is where I feel my mistake lies. I didn’t want a baby to be a bargaining chip. I wanted my child to be loved by two parents.

I am now dating someone who I know would make a great dad. I think about how I never would have met him if I followed through with my pregnancy. I think of my future kids and how happy and loved they will feel to two, committed parents who have the resources and are prepared to do everything to take care of them.

As guilty as I feel for admitting this, I feel like my mistake wasn’t so much the abortion as it was having sex with a man I didn’t trust. I believe smart decisions in who we sleep with (hook-up culture is very damaging IMO) and contraception (I now strongly advocate using multiple methods at once) is the most important solution to unwanted pregnancy. 

I guess I am pro-choice, but I still feel abortion is sad and in an ideal world abortion would not exist.",t2_7rwz86qp,1634584223,prolife

"The reasons stated for seeking abortions aren't the real reason, the real reason is not thinking it's wrong to kill human beings","If the reasons stated for commonly seeking abortion were legitimate reasons to seek abortion, then they would be legitimate reasons to seek killing offspring after birth as well.

We can be sympathetic and empathetic of the stated reasons for seeking or obtaining abortions, which are generally not wanting to raise their own children, not wanting to be pregnant with their own children who already exist, or economic reasons.

But if those reasons were sufficient to end the life of your offspring, then it would be legal to end their offspring's life after birth if the law were consistent.  Yet, I doubt many who would either abort or encourage abortion for the reasons stated above would end the life of their born offspring or encourage others to end the life of their offspring after birth, which is not consistent.

The logic behind the argument that you should be allowed to legally kill your offspring before birth if you don't want to raise children or have economic considerations would not stop applying after birth.  You are just as able to sign up for adoption before birth as you are after birth, and not wanting to be pregnant is not a good enough reason to kill a neonate, so it is not a good enough reason to kill our offspring at any time.  Not wanting your offspring inside you when that is the only place they can survive is not enough reason to intentionally kill them, which ends in the same result as if you'd waited until birth to end their life.

If pro-choicers thought it was wrong to kill other human beings who have committed no crime, then they would want abortion to be illegal.  It is not consistent to want it to be legal to kill human beings who have committed no crime before birth, while wanting it to be illegal to kill born humans.  Either it's wrong to kill human beings or it's not.  Either it's wrong to kill members of our species or it's not.  Lets not be blind to science, lets not pretend our offspring aren't living human beings.",t2_1468jo,1634532467,prolife

You Should be Proud to Be Pro-Life,"Hi everyone.

I have stage 4 endometriosis and I just had laparoscopic excision surgery last Monday, after battling this extremely painful condition for over 25 years.

You know it’s sad…the Reddit spaces for conditions such as these are hostile to women who care about and defend the unborn. Endometriosis, miscarriage support, infertility…you name it. If even one pro-abortion extremist digs through your profile and finds that you’re pro-life, they see it as an open invitation for ugliness. You can block and report them all day. 

And here is the thing that really sucks. I know for a fact that there are pro-life people in those spaces that sit back and say nothing. While women who’ve miscarried are attacked by people who invalidate their grief and call their babies “clumps of cells.”

You should be PROUD to be pro-life. You should support pro-life women who are going through tough times navigating our broken healthcare system that has equated “reproductive rights” with “abortion rights.”

I’m a living example of a system that every day prioritizes women seeking abortions over women seeking adequate care for serious medical problems involving their reproductive systems. 

I’ve lost two babies in the first trimester!
I’ve spent THOUSANDS being mistreated by ill-trained and Ill-equipped OBGYNs!
I lost a Fallopian tube and my ovaries are currently stitched to my abdominal wall!
It took 20 years to get a diagnosis!

This is reproductive healthcare in this country. 

WAKE UP!

Speak out. Do not let pro-abortion zealots dominate spaces for women’s health issues.  And for the love of God, if you have a daughter with painful periods, please call a surgeon that’s skilled in laparoscopic excision. Do it before they end up like me. 

Thank you.",t2_wf1od,1634441757,prolife

“ bacteria is life on Mars but a heartbeat life on earth“,Abortion is a very hard topic to talk about because I (female) live in area where everyone is pro choice.I’m a bit of both because I believe abortion is for those who have been raped or are in a position where their life is at risk. Other than that it’s not justifiable because by the time you find out your pregnant the fetus already has a heartbeat making it a living thing so why is killing it justified as ok?I hate when people say “I did it out of love” no you did it out of fear or pure selfishness. The worst of all these people are the ones who use it as type of birth control. Something I heard that really sticks out and makes sense to me is the song lyrics that say “bacteria in his life on Mars but a heartbeat it’s alive on earth“ so if bacteria is considered a living thing why isn’t a fetus with a heart beat considered one?🤷🏻‍♀️,t2_a36o7pxk,1634107750,prolife

"Pro-lifers, pray for me","  So it’s been a while since I’ve posted on this subreddit. Still pro-life as ever, maybe even more. I feel glad knowing I can always come back here to people who will understand me, ferociously kind and deligent as they’ve always been. I always like to present myself as a bold figure. Those who stand proud and strong strike fear and doubt into the hearts of abusers. But as all humans, I have reached a point sheee I waved, not in my convictions, but in myself.

The worst feeling is realizing how bad my depression actually is when it finally catches up to me, devouring everything in its path as I’m left hopeless in the reality that I will never truly outrun it. 

 I hold on to hope as much as I can to the point of exhaustion. The pro-life generation is younger than ever, increasingly progressive(the idea that all human beings deserve to exist without any debt is about as progressive an idea as you can get), and growing in popularity and enlightenment every day. And we know pro-choicers are big mad about this since they never want to admit it, clinging to their regressive ideas and tired arguments from 50 years back, knowing that they will eventually have to deal with not being allowed to use smaller humans a collateral damage for their own irresponsibility, and that’s a though that brings me great satisfaction. They can stay mad. One of the greatest life lessons you will learn is being content in making certain people unhappy. Never back down on what you know to be right just to make evil more comfortable with being evil.

 But I’ve reached a pitfall, and as always, I never know if this is or isn’t going to be the turning point. After living 20 years building up trauma along the way on top of my neurodivergency, my greatest fear is that I will not live to see the day that we achieve an everlasting victory.

 I just don’t know any more. I don’t really know where I’m going with this. I don’t know if it’s going to make me feel any better. But perhaps, maybe all I want is for someone to spare some hope for me? If that’s possible?

 I don’t know how long I’m going to last in this world, but I hope that with my time I will have SOME positive effect, encourage  SOMEONE to change, stop being such a goddamn pussy over every single thing because I’m a useless piece of trash excluded from the human rights I demand for everyone else.

 I guess I’m a weird perversion of the whole ‘personally pro-life‘ thing. I’m upstandingly pro-life. I will demand the love and care for others that I will never truly allow for myself, knowing deep down that I am not completely lovable or worthy at my core.

 I just can’t care about myself anymore knowing how needed it is elsewhere. I don’t value my life. I’m the exception in my activism.",t2_519onnba,1634089115,prolife

Speciesism is justified,"So I'm pretty adamantly pro life when it comes to human children but I really don't place value on other animals or living things. I think the standards we place on what kind of animals are protected (dogs, cats, birds) and what is not protected (cows, chickens, pigs) is completely arbitrary just like the term limits pro choice people will argue for. You can be vegan/vegetarian, but you're still placing an arbitrary standard on what kind of lives are protected (plants are ok to eat, bugs and pests are ok to kill).

I consider myself entirely pro-human for tribalistic and speciesist reasons. I am human, therefore I prioritize humanity above all else. For me, not only are all other lifeforms inferior to human lives, but any action against other species that can be said to provide a net benefit to humanity I believe is justified. Of course I also believe in a sense of practicality, i.e., breeding animals just to torture for some sick kind of entertainment isn't sustainable or a good use of resources. But prioritizing human life over all other kinds of life I believe is the ideal standard. I know there are pro lifers here who feel differently so I'm curious, what do you all think?",t2_9uxsm,1634072533,prolife

"If you believe that ""banning abortions will just cause women to die in unsafe abortions"" is a good argument for keeping abortion legal. Then you have to be for keeping abortion legal until delivery for any reason.","Firstly, I get that there are pro-choicers who make this argument and also believe abortion on demand up to delivery should be legal. Your at least being consistent, this criticism doesn't apply to you.

It always annoys me whenever I see someone make an argument like ""if you ban abortion you'll just ban *safe* abortions"" and then go on to say something like ""I don't believe in third trimester abortion"" etc...

Like what about women who want a late term abortion? Aren't you putting their lives at risk? Especially since doing a late term abortion by yourself is a lot more dangerous than an early term abortion in many cases.

What about all those draconian laws that people like the bring up, the infamous ""criminal investigations into miscarriages"", what if someone has a miscarriage later on in their pregnancy?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason so many people hold such a contradictory position is simple, they're not being logical. Their argument at the end of the day is based on the fact that they don't think the unborn are people and no matter how much they try to deflect it and bring up other things like ""women dying from unsafe abortions"" the fact still remains that their reason for holding their beliefs is that they don't see the unborn as human. So when they finally do see them as human (i.e. in the late term) suddenly they can understand why just because someone is going to harm another person in a more dangerous doesn't mean we should make it legal to harm that person.

You see the same thing with bodily autonomy, polls show most Americans are against late term abortions even though roughly half of them identify as pro-choice and probably think bodily autonomy or ""my body my choice"" is a good argument. Because that never was the argument it was personhood and once people reach a point (i.e in the late term) where they can't deny the humanity of the unborn these weak arguments fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you ever use the argument ""women will just get unsafe abortions therefore abortion should be legal"" or ""abortion should be legal because of bodily autonomy"" then the only way to be **consistent** with your beliefs is to be for abortion at any time for any reason. To advocate for a time restriction or to bar certain reasons as excuses for abortion would simply be **illogical.**",t2_9ev60ea5,1634036596,prolife

Inevitable pro-choice seizing of /r/abortiondebate has finally occurred. I recommend pro-lifers unsubscribe.,"Long ago, the moderator of /r/prochoice and I were friendly enough and cooperated in supporting the moderation of our various subreddits (watching out for various trolls, preventing brigading, etc), and could commiserate on modding issues, blablabla. They reached out to me to work together on a mutual ground, /r/abortiondebate, which they had created. 

At first it was small and very moderate-able. Given how pro-choice leaning Reddit is as a whole, the sub was a surprisingly even ground for pro-choicers and pro-lifers to interact respectfully.  

This is no longer the case.

As the sub grew, it become inundated with pro-choicers. This became evident with the voting issue (any pro-life comment got downvoted, vice versa) very early on. This has only gotten worse. The rhetoric towards pro-lifers was constantly derisive, and only the most egregious were banned or warned. 

At some point most of the PC mods became inactive leaving one PL mod. The caliber of the sub didn't change much, even so, but the sub members lost their shit about this.

Now the main moderator has removed all pro-life moderators.
See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/q43dwn/large_changes_today/) for further details. 

This wasn't a good sub for mutual debate and it isn't now. As you can see in the link, the intention is clearly no longer to make it a place of mutual respect. It's effectively another /r/prochoice parading as a debate sub. If that's your thing, have at it. But I would personally recommend letting it continue rotting.",t2_5fz3x,1633906225,prolife

I was told that because I can’t safely carry a fetus to the point of viability without a medical Ablation being needed I should never be intimate with anyone for the rest of my life.,"So long story short I have a complex medical history that involves my diaphragm being extremely weak and unpredictable in the case of pregnancy. And if I were to get pregnant my diaphragm would most likely rip and I would go into septic shock. This would almost likely happen before the fetus would be viable. I was told by some very pro life people that due to this unfortunate complication I should never be allowed to be intimate with anyone because if my birth control and condoms should fail I would most likely need an abortion.  And if I do decide to do so I am lower than a murder/criminal and I should be locked up for even considering the risk. on top of that I was also told that I am depriving my partner of the joys of parenthood and the fact that I’m even with someone is unholy and will send me to hell for “punishing them with my curse.”

Abortion Uncertainty?,"I’m unsure whether I should be supporting pro life and pro choice.

I’m trying my best to avoid propaganda and emotions attached to it &amp; make a logical ideological choice. 

I have a few questions before I commit &amp; felt this was the best place to explore them:
1. I’ve read through various posts and literature. It appears the idea of an abortion being referred to as a ‘maternity treatment or care’ is opposed as PL.  I understand why this might be - but struggle when it’s used for ectopic pregnancy, still born or medically required. What should it be called then? 
2. Relates to above. I like to make logical sense and a clear line of thinking. Should I be against all abortion or is there exceptions to the rule - I.e. victim of rape, child having a significant medical condition that is likely to impair their quality of life, or the mother’s health being in jeopardy? 
3. If the answer to above is yes - what  are the exceptions? 
4. Who should be held responsible for the abortion - mother or doctor or companies/government? A mix? 
5. Can I be pro death penalty and PL? All life is sacred argument - I just find this a contradiction &amp; I am not religious. 
6. I’ve seen financial implications discussed and I’m just looking for guidance as my country has a free health care system. I can imagine there are companies who take advantage of people and interest is based on making a profit. I also believe some doctors are likely to fall into this category; however don’t feel this can always be the case - especially in my country where they are paid/would have a job abortions or otherwise.  I don’t think it’s the case - but can I be PL away from the financial argument? I know a lot of argument is attached to American issues and conditions. 
7. I like the liberal view of the government having the least input on individuals freedoms. In my country we have a right to private life often cited. This is my biggest struggle - a right to make choices in my life without restriction. But also giving a directive via the state Around medical procedures. I have real issues with some aesthetic procedures being illegal in my country &amp; other cosmetic procedures being allowed. I find this contradictory. Similarly I feel this way about acts in my private life and leisure between groups that have recently been made illegal when it has no affect or harm to those outside the participating group.  This is my biggest issue &amp; is my lean to pro choice - maybe the thought should be pro choice without the other agendas attached? Like finance or political lines drawn? 

I completely understand it’s a complicated issue and I’m just trying to understand for my own perspective where I go from here. 

Any input is appreciated.",t2_519jifmp,1633595725,prolife

What are your thoughts on the women trying to leave Texas in order to get an abortion elsewhere?,"I'm pro-choice but have been really curious about how some pro-lifers may feel about this. With the current bill being active in Texas, there have already been some articles written on pregnant women who have went to extreme lengths (driving to another state, putting their jobs at risk) in order to get an abortion. Given that the purpose of the bill was to remove abortion on demand and ensure pregnant woman carry the pregnancy until term for the safety/wellbeing of the fetus, these women are going out of their way and not allowing the laws of Texas to prevent them from terminating their pregnancy; they drive to another state, put their job at risk in doing so, or some may even hide their pregnancy.

What are your thoughts on these women who have gone to such lengths to get an abortion? How do you feel about them? Do you believe anything should be done about them to ensure they do not terminate their pregnancy (such as convincing them, harsher abortion bans, etc.) Given that these women defeat the entire purpose of the bill, what are your thoughts on their actions? Do you believe anything should be done about these women, if anything should be done at all?

A more broad question: What are your thoughts on pregnant women in general whom still try to find ways to terminate their pregnancy despite there being an abortion ban (whatever method that may be, such as harmful methods, moving to a different state, taking pills)?

I will start by clarifying that English is not my mother tongue, so forgive the mistakes.

So as anti abortion they consider abortion wrong because it is murder, right?

That is not really the point, my question is this; As a murder legally would be an aggravated homicide by bond depends on the country, do you agree that people who abort are accused of this aggravated homicide? Should they receive the same penalties for this type of homicide or should there be a different abortion crime?  Should she go to jail and be totally excluded from society?

To those of you who compare a pregnancy to a person who needs blood from someone else to survive,"This argument obviously tries to justify abortion by arguing that both cases are alike and that you aren't and shouldn't be forced to give blood to someone even if they need it to stay alive. While yes, in both cases the being in question (the fetus in the womb or the person who needs blood to stay alive) is reliant on someone else to survive, there is still a key difference. In the case of the pregnancy, if it was caused by consensual sex, then it completely destroys this argument. Because the mother's decision to have sex caused the fetus to form inside of her putting the fetus in this position where it needs the mother to stay alive. Meanwhile, the person who needs blood to survive wasn't put in that position by you so you aren't responsible for what happens to them. Which is why these two example aren't comparable.",t2_a5pmghi9,1633542965,prolife

How did you convince a pro-choicer?,"Tldr at bottom

My long-term girlfriend is pro-choice and I feel like anything I've told her doesn't convince her. We love each other very much, but this topic we can never seem to see eye to eye, so I'm wondering how you were able to convince someone. My mom was a pro-choicer and always tells me it was until she had me and realized it was a life in her all that time and she nor anyone else didn't have the right to end it. I'm Catholic and have my Catholic reasonings, but my girlfriend was more of a Catholic by force due to her grandma forcefully shoving it down her throat, so now she has a bad taste for religion in general. So I can't really use Catholic arguments about God to justify it. 

My gf's mom had an abortion when she was a teenager and my girlfriend always defends it by saying it's her choice. I think this is what really makes it hard because she doesn't want to see what her mom did as murder. Additionally, she cited r\*pe as a case, and I told her that the sins of a child's father should not mean the child dies. Again, this is from a religious point of view, but also a scientific as life does indeed start at conception, but she always gets quiet when I say that because she says its just a clump of cells and the baby isn't sentient. 

I just really want to convince her because it kind of broke my heart the way she sees the unborn as conveniences or inconveniences. Like she told me she would abort our child if she was in her late 40's and got pregnant because she wouldn't want kids that late and the child could come out with a disability. It really makes me see her as an evil person and I don't want to think that about her. I tell myself she just doesn't know what she's talking about and will change her mind when she has kids, but I know this is just a cope. 

What did you say to get through to them?

Tldr; How do I convince my girlfriend, preferably without using religion, that babies aren't just clump of cells and that we can't just throw away human life?",t2_8kukfvrp,1633483473,prolife

Choice is isn’t what you think it is,"Ask someone who has tried to conceive for years.

Ask someone who has suffered through recurring miscarriage.

Choice isn’t what you think it is.


I hear it too often from people—whether pro-life or pro-choice. “So we decided to start a family.”

No…you didn’t. You decided to have unprotected sex while ovulating. You cannot “will” a person into existence. All you did was kick the field goal. But you do not get to decide how hard the wind blows. You don’t get to decide what happens next. 

My friend has struggled with infertility for years. Thousands spent in for IVF and the best medical care money can buy. Finally got pregnant. Lost her daughter in the womb 2 weeks from her due date. 

Where was her choice? There are some things we can’t choose. 


And just like you can’t will someone into existence, you cannot erase them once they’re here. Even if you “choose” abortion. That doesn’t change the fact they existed and will be in your brain for as long as you have one. 

I love the word “choice.” But the lack of wisdom present in “pro-choice” is so strikingly profound to anyone who has experienced the powerlessness of loss—and those who know what a miracle life really is.",t2_wf1od,1633463108,prolife

Dear Pro-aborts: If your argument cannot handle an unborn baby being called a baby - your argument is bad.,"So this is now a thing with pro-aborts that needs to be said: If your argument requires that people use a word other than baby when discussing an unborn baby, and it doesn't matter the stage of development be it zygote or fetus or whatever, than your entire argument is junk.

Baby refers to any very young human, baby is just the common vernacular for the word. A mother can call her 50 year old son ""Her baby"", a father can call his 14 year old daughter ""His baby"", it doesn't matter - baby can refer to anyone younger than yourself.

If you froth at the mouth and freak out when someone calls an unborn child a baby because it weakens your argument you need to find a new argument and give up trying to convince people to stop using the word baby. 

And before you say ""Oh well pro-lifers have to call the zygote a baby or their argument falls apart"": A human zygote is still a human, people use the term baby to refer to an unborn child to cover the full range of the early stages/young stages of human development.",t2_lxmbf,1633443450,prolife

For all of those who genuinely think abortion is murder would not any action taken to immediately stop it be justified?

If you saw you neighbor actively butchering a 6 year old you would be considered a hero for “stopping” them.

Also if I am being completely honest I do not support laws that say “You can abort after X weeks” Why? It is essential admiring that it is ok to kill someone if the are 1 day too young.

No one Really Wins,"No matter what legislation passes, in the end nobody is really going to win. If the pro choicers ""win"", we get to keep abortions safe for a few more years. Even before Roe v Wade, people were getting pregnant and having dangerous abortions. Now with the internet, I sure there will be some ill advised tik tok or youtube videos up shortly. Just look at all the misinformation about covid.  Women will die, women will get hurt. I don't know why we 100% lay this on the woman's shoulders. While it is nice to believe that there is always a white knight to step up and be a good dad, we know that is not the case.

I have seen some of their questions on some of the other subreddits about female anatomy and it scares the hell out of me that they are so misinformed. Parents need to start teaching them better respect of women so that will translate to the next generation.

A few questions for Pro-Lifers,"Hey, I used to consider myself a pro-choicer but after learning more about both sides I'm somewhere in between. I had some questions for this community, if you could answer them that would be great :)

In cases where the mother would almost definitely die because of complications but the kid would survive, is abortion ethical? 
If yes, what is the minimum chance of the mother's death that would make abortion acceptable? 90%? 50%?

In cases where the kid would almost definitely die, is abortion ethical?
If no, why? Wouldn't it just create more attachment and therefore more trauma for the parents?
If yes, what is the minimum chance of the child's death that makes abortion ethical?

If the mother is the victim of rape etc, is abortion acceptable?
If no, wouldn't this unfairly affect the life of the mother? Taking care of a baby isn't easy, and this could affect the entire life of the mother for a decision that she had no part in taking. While of course the baby's life has some value, is it more valuable than the mother's well-being? (For the sake of argument, assume that the father is never found in this case)

It seems like Pro-Lifers value the life of a baby from the moment that it has a chance of survival, is this accurate? At what point does the baby's life have value - at the moment of conception, or what?

How to handle the consequences of banning abortion,"Hello everybody, hope you are having a wonderful day. I would like to clarify that this post is not meant in any way to support either side of the abortion argument (pro-life or pro-choice). I myself am somewhat of a moderate and would be probably hated by both sides, but that is not important. What I am interested in is how would this subreddit tackle some problems that might rise with banning abortion. The problem I have in mind is abandoned children. Since women who are having abortion generally do not want their kids, problem might arise with those kids later being put up for adoption.

How would you ensure that children arent only protected from death by abortion, but also from death after birth when adoption centers will be flooded with unwanted children? Would you increase funding or get the government involved to ensure they get enough food and other vital necessities? Would you make those parents pay a slightly higher tax to increase such funding? Or do you simply hope that there will be a private charity and that people will donate enough to properly fund such institutions?

Donation Requests and You,"This subreddit occasionally gets requests to aid new or expecting mothers with the costs of dealing with a pregnancy or a new child.  As pro-life advocates, this is obviously a call that you all are very much willing to answer with your time and money.

However, we ask those responding to such requests and those posting them to be aware of our rule about not making posts soliciting direct donations of cash to posters.  

Unfortunately, there are instances of fraud on-line and Reddit is far from immune to this.  Many GoFundMe and other direct cash donation sites may represent those simply willing to pretend to be in need in search of cash.

Rule six mandates the use of Amazon Wish Lists or similar tools where a parent in need can ask for items specifically related to their child care needs, and pro-life members (or indeed anyone seeing that appeal) can actually buy the specific item for those who have the need.  

Alternately, we support charities that we can validate are legitimate and which will ensure that either items or money will make it to those in need.  

Members of this organizations who are able to validate their credentials are encouraged to send a message to modmail and we can discuss with them what is needed for their appeal to be posted here.  

Please understand, we do recognize that many appeals for cash are entirely legitimate, but it is our responsibility to not allow the potential for fraud to go unchecked.  The moderation team will be happy to try and sanction what appeals for cash we can validate, but it may not be possible for us to always do that to our satisfaction if you are not an accredited charity.  

Thank you for your consideration.",t2_11qgai,1633225573,prolife

Could she not have an opinion before the surgery? Ooh, how about *during* the surgery, just to make things interesting? Should everyone have this procedure?

I’m on the fence between pro-life beliefs and pro-choice beliefs.,"I (20F) am on the fence between being pro-life or pro-choice. I live in a European country that has no abortion laws (meaning abortion is completely illegal) I believe that we may have a referendum in the coming years in order to collectively decide whether to keep the strict laws against abortion or to legalize and decriminalize it. My country is a predominantly catholic country. 

I would like to ask this group first as I know a lot of pro-life groups tend to get a lot of hate for their stance on abortion. I also know there is a lot of propaganda on each side in order to belittle the other sides beliefs. 

My questions are:

Why are you personally against abortion? 

Do you believe life begins at conception?

Do you agree with more comprehensive sex education?

Do you agree that both women and men should have the option to sterilize themselves if they do not want children? 

What is your opinion on adoption? Should adoption fees be less expensive to make the process of adopting a child easier? 

Do you agree with government assistance programs in order to help women keep babies that they cannot afford? (Government housing, a monthly allowance, etc) 

What is your opinion on pregnancies conceived from rape or incest, should they be able to abort? 

What is your opinion on teenage pregnancies? (I ask this because there is a lot of debate online about whether teens should be allowed to continue their pregnancies)",t2_bgvue889,1633216772,prolife

Look, you can have your beliefs, that’s what’s great about America, but if you’re pro life, then you don’t get that abortion. Don’t impose your beliefs on someone else. If someone gets an abortion and you think she’s going to hell, Great, let it be. That’s her problem not yours. Are you raising that kid that was “saved” from that abortion? No? So why are you so worried about it?

Has anyone seen this?,"So in this article published under Ms Magazine by the author Carrie Baker, it attempted to rebut the idea that an embryo  has a heartbeat at six weeks. In her article where she claims to be dissecting scientifically incorrect statements about embryos/fetuses, Baker links an embryology textbook describing the stages of pregnancy to ""prove"" that the heart does not even exist in a six week old fetus. 

Unsurprisingly, the embryology textbook contradicts her claim directly, stating that between embryonic day 16 and day 20, the heart has already begun to pump fluid through blood vessels, and after day 20 the first red blood cells have appeared.

Secular-Prolife called her out for this on Twitter and she has since removed the link the the embryology textbook on the article.

A list of statistics regarding how Americans currently feel about Abortion,"Hello, I’m a prolife person from the r/prolife subreddit. I decided to try to do my own research on the current popularity of Abortion in the US and come to a reasonable unbiased opinion on the subject. I’ve posted this post to both subs r/prochoice and r/prolife to keep both sides up to date. Even though I’m biased in favor of prolife, I’m going to try to keep any bias to a minimum and instead I’m simply going to post what the current polling suggests. 

##General Stats

[People who identify as Prolife and Prochoice are nearly tied](https://www.statista.com/statistics/225975/share-of-americans-who-are-pro-life-or-pro-choice/) with 49% of people identifying as prochoice and 47% identifying as prolife. 

[Despite this, 70% of Americans claim to not want Roe v Wade overturned](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/) oddly enough. 

[Governor Abbott is currently mostly unapproved of, but it is likely because of his poor handling of COVID, not the abortion ban](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-gov-greg-abbotts-approval-plummets-54-now-believe-state-wrong-track-1630609). That is more unpopular outside of Texas than inside of it. 

##By Race and Religion

Recent polling suggests that Whites and Hispanics are roughly [tied on views on abortion](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-race-and-ethnicity/) (within statistical margin of error). Blacks and Asians are by far the most pro-choice of the minority groups polled. 

Blacks have however rapidly shifted their views on abortion. Shifting from [majority pro-life to majority pro-choice within a decade](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/318932/black-americans-abortion.aspx).

[White Catholics are less likely to be pro-life than Hispanic Catholics](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2019/08/13/abortion-hispanic-and-white-catholics-differ-their-views) interestingly. This could be because being Catholic is more of a religious default for Hispanics. 

[White Evangelicals are by far the most pro-life major religious group](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/), Catholics are actually more likely to believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases than illegal in all/most cases. White Evangelicals being overwhelmingly prolife makes sense because they were the faction that lead the charge against abortion in the first place, and it’s still a major key issue for them. 

##By Trend

It’s often said that approval of abortion is basically the same as it was in the 90’s, and [that’s basically true](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion/iframe/). However, this is because the prochoice movement is mostly recovering from its disastrous public support in the 2000’s. In the year 2008, people saying that Abortion should be “illegal in most or all cases” was only 3% lower than “Legal in most or all cases), which is abortions’ lowest level of support in any recent year. 

However, the Prochoice movement began a renaissance in the year 2016, with abortion legality over double digit support over making it illegal. The highest support in recent years is 61% in 2019. For comparison, it was 60% in 1995. 

Currently, 59% of the country thinks Abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 39% of the country thinks it should be illegal in most or all cases. 

[Going by specific position](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-detailed/iframe/), 25% of adults believe that abortion should be legal in all cases, 34% believe it should be legal in most cases, 26% believe it should be illegal in most cases, and 13% believe it should be illegal in all cases. The rest are unsure. 

##By Party Affiliation

I’m just going to say the very obvious; most Republicans want abortion to be illegal, most Democrats want abortion to be legal. Shocking huh? 

[By support of abortion of members of a certain party](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-party-identification/iframe/), 80% of Democrats believe that Abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 19% believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. 35% of Republicans believe that Abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 63% of republicans believe abortion should be illegal in most/all cases. So interestingly, Democrats are more pro-choice than republicans are pro-life. 

Very interestingly, self described moderate/lean republicans are more likely to [believe abortion should be legal in most/all cases than illegal in most/all cases](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-party-ideology/iframe/). That being said, the fact that the Republican base in general is 2/3rds prolife suggests the continued rapid erosion of the moderate Republican bloc. Make of that what you will. 

##By Gender

Very interestingly, Women are only [slightly more likely](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-gender/iframe/) than men on average to support abortion. 62% of women believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases, and 56% of men believe that abortion should be legal in most/all cases. That means women support abortion 6% more than men, which is only barely statistically significant. That’s very unusual for something that’s allegedly a “womens’ rights issue”. This is likely because for women, other identities (religion, race, age, party preference, etc.) are more likely to take priority over gender identity. 

##By Age 

Contrary to popular belief, the 65* age group is [more likely](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-age/iframe/) to support abortion than the 50-64 age group. This means the Baby Boomers are the most prolife living generation and not Silent Generation. Also to nobody’s surprise, Gen Z is the most prochoice generation by a long mile. 67% of people aged 18-29 believe abortion should be legal in most/all cases, and only 31% of them believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. 

##By Education

[No educational cohort has a majority pro-life population](https://www.pewforum.org/chart/views-on-abortion-by-education-level/iframe/). However, people with High School level of education or less are statistically tied in their support for abortion. 50% of them believe that abortion should be legal in most/all cases, 47% believe it should be illegal in most/all cases. For people with some College experience, support for abortion rises to 61%, and it’s 68% for college graduates. 

##In Conclusion

From these stats, I believe that while the prolife movement is a minority, they have become more devout in recent years, and have been heavily campaigning against abortion during the 2010’s. While the issue is still majorly important for the core Republican base, it’s also paradoxically losing steam relative to other major issues to the Republican base, such as Immigration and election integrity. This is because the prolife movement is extremely associated with the Evangelical movement, which has fallen to the wayside for the new Populist movement that has taken the Republican base by storm. 

This is also true for the Democrats who have lost interest in the issue since the early 2010’s, but have become re-enthused by the pass of the Texas abortion law. Since it is now a hot topic again, we should be seeing a backlash from both sides of the aisle.",t2_aw4gyd39,1633117567,prolife

i have a question for the prolifers,"I think one of the most important arguments in abortion are the consequences of abortion ban personally. Like sure we could endlessly discuss philosophical stuff what constitutes a person, what is life etc etc(as these debates often end up being more philosophical then medical) and whether it's morally right or wrong but are these arguments really that important over the pressing statistics of how abortion laws don't discourage abortion but rather increase dangerous abortions?

Lack of well funded abortion clinics would just lead to young women committing suicide and suffering depression by the hordes and risking their lives. Recently in India, we had a rape victim try to abort her own fetus by watching a youtube tutorial?? Can you believe that?? And that's definitely not the only incident. Not to mention the fact that the people that would be most affected by an abortion ban would just be the poor and the marginalized.

I'm genuinely curious to see what you guys think of this because I used to be a prolifer but I just don't understand how denying abortions to needy women would have any possible positive impact.",t2_579nfbit,1633110486,prolife

"Patience, compassion and kindness: an advice on how to talk to pro-choicers","I've noticed a lot of posts from people complaining about how closed-minded pro-choicers are. They say you can't converse with them, that they are brainwashed, etc. And while I think there is some truth to this, I will try to explain why I think the problem lies not so much with the pro-choicers but more with how we are dealing with the situation.

We've all had a conversation with a pro-choicer at one time or another and ended up in an argument, usually one where we are shouted at and given no space to talk. In these situations I always make it a point to stay calm, breathe and let them say what they want. I think that reacting aggressively would be the worst thing in the world because if they are already paranoid and distrustful, a direct ""attack"" would only end up confirming their fears. Sometimes it is very difficult and painful, because I love them very much as people and as friends but they say horrible things to me and I have to put up with it.

However, this is the best strategy to dialogue and convince in my opinion. Pro-choice people are like onions - Shrek reference - and one has to peel their lines of defense and arguments calmly so as not to end up crying. My friends see that I don't react to their insults or passive-aggressive statements, but listen to them and speak calmly. Short, calm, non-ironic responses are best. That way they let their guard down little by little.

We have to take into account the world and society we live in today. The modern world is in crisis and in order to feel safe everyone is entrenched behind their own opinions and beliefs. The one who thinks differently is seen as an enemy, one who is incapable of love, reason, dialogue, etc. This goes both ways. The PC movement is especially biased and sectarian in the sense that they have been taught that to go against the movement is to be anti-woman and sexist. A friend literally said to me once; ""no, I can't talk to you because I would not be in solidarity with my fellow women"". This is the level of entrenchment and war mentality that is in place. 


The best thing we can do is to dismantle their stereotypes with actions and words. If they call you cruel, show kindness. If they call you biased, show yourself open to dialogue. If they call you anti-woman, be compassionate. Soon they will have nothing to attack you with, because they themselves will see that what they say about you is not true. I recommend to stop checking r/prochoice or making posts of their sub in the first place as these only feed and reaffirm the ideas the pro-choicers have of us. Over time you will see them let their guard down and abandon their defensive attitude. You'd be surprised how many pro-choicers take the initiative and start asking questions in good faith once they're out of their foxhole. Once they have established a trusting relationship, where they know it's not about destroying the other in the debate but about learning something new, they will be able to engage in a calm and confident dialogue.


Side note: I would also try to reduce the amount of ""things pro-choicers say"" or ""pro-choicer nonsense"" style posts. They're not necessarily bad but lately that's all I see in this sub and I'm concerned it will lower the quality of debate and content on here.",t2_bec7k5ya,1633086947,prolife

That means that almost 1/4 anti-abortionists don't believe that if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, a condition that, when left unchecked, will result in the death of both the mother and the child 100% of the time.  I've never heard a single person who holds this position.  1/4 is a lot...

should we normalize teen pregnancy and teen parenting ?,"hello there I am pro choice, I try asking this earlier but people complain about the grammar and I really need this answer. so looking at some pro life argument I say yes we should from my point of view! if we normalize teen pregnancy and parenting then most people should be happy

pro life will be happy cause that is less abortion

pro life feminist will be happy cause that is women empowerment

pro choice will be happy cause your not forcing these teen girl to be parent's against their will

pro abortion, conservative and around 50% of the parents of the teen parents probably won't be happy but hey you can't plz everyone

this would give teenager who have gotten pregnant or got someone else pregnant support cause they can see it's no big deal if it become the new norm

it seem that pro life people wanna argue that a women is never too young to have a baby and be a mother so why not normalize it?

if you are wondering what age we are talking about like how young then I say, if you are old enough to activity look for sex then your old enough to be a parent and also im going with the assumption that the people in question will take care of the kids them self, not have the parent's or grandparents raise the baby as their own",t2_4peg9a81,1633035269,prolife

FOR THOSE WHO ARE PRO-DEATH PENALTY BUT ANTI-EUTHANASIA,"I understand there are MANY reasons for pro-lifers to support or condemn the death penalty and likewise euthanasia- however today i would appreciate hearing specifically from those who are pro-death penalty and anti-euthanasia. 

probably the biggest argument i’ve seen against euthanasia from (religious) pro-lifers is that it’s taking a decision and life plan away from God, and that he is the only one who can truly relieve a human of their earthly presence. if you believe in God this makes sense to me. But how could you believe God doesn’t want a terminally ill person to be in control of how/when they die (when they know it’s happening soon anyways, nonetheless), but he wants the government to decide which criminals deserve life or not?

how is making that decision for yourself under extreme circumstances “playing god” but literally having someone kill entirely separate humans isn’t???? and how do you KNOW he wants you to kill criminals but not extremely sick people who are suffering? 
how can you be so sure that the death penalty is right and effective when several have been falsely murdered under it, yet are so against someone who knows for a FACT that they DO want this?",t2_33gfrpbs,1633009667,prolife

What do you think would be a good solution?,"No sure if it's allowed but mostly wanted to discuss this with you all.

I'm pro-choice and read some of the post and realized that we'll probably never agree on this issue. From what I've see pro-lifers belive that live begins at conception and there is no excuse for an abortion unless it's a medical emergency or the pregnant person is a minor. Pro-choicers belive women get final say regardless of reason, plus some don't belive a life start until a person is born. Personaly I just want people to have a right to choose.

Basically I want to know what your solutions would be/your opinion on some of the points below. I've seen the argument that outlawing abortions won't stop them so it doesn't matter if they're outlawed. What about the other way around. Allowing abortions won't force women who don't want one to have one so why not allow it. 

Also about quality of life, mostly in regards to rape victims. Some can carry out the pregnancy and love the child regardless, but what about the ones who would be forced to do it, having to deal with the difficulties of an unwanted pregnancy and having to explain to co-workers why they're not keeping the baby(adoption), some children have spoken out about being the product of rape and knowing that they where not wanted and posibly abused because if it, bouncing from relative to relative or just treated differently than their siblings. Sure adoption is an option but there's still a stigma about it and maybe the family will adopt them but then it's the same thing, knowing that they weren't wanted, or the mother will keep them maybe thinking ""I won't love this child but I won't abuse them""

Also what about people in abusive relationships where women would be forced to have a child with an abuser and then have that child used against them, ""I hurt you or the kid"" 

There's a popular tiktok going over how pro-lifers belive a fetus is a baby but don't treat it as one under the law. Not allowing these points 
- being able to claim the unborn child as a dependent
- assault of a pregnant woman should also be child abuse 
- taking out life insurance on the child
- men having to pay child support when the pregnancy is confirmed. 
- extra food stamps and welfare 

If they can pass laws basically stopping abortions then they can pass these.

Are they people in this sub who were targeted by the abortion industry when they were unborn ?,"I am what Bob Ross could call ""a happy little accident"". My parents were and still are crazy in love with each other, but they were in a adultery relationship when I was conceived : my mom was single but my dad was married to another wife and had other kids. He forgot to put a condom just one time and POOF, I was created. 

When my mom learned, she was really happy, because I was her first child after spending almost 10 years in an in-vitro fertilization program without success, but she was also worried by my dad's reaction. The first weeks, he was the happiest man in the world, he planned to divorce his wife (with whom he was no longer happy) and live with my mom. But then, I don't know what the hell happened, maybe his wife or something like this, but he started to panic and asked my mom to have an abortion.

She was ready to do this, she took an appointment at her local clinic and had a two weeks waiting period, and it was during these two weeks that she realised that she was going to waste her only chance to give birth to the child she always wanted just because her partner couldn't man-up and assume his acts, she literally changed her mind, asked me for forgiveness (even if I didn't have a single idea about what was going on outside) and cancelled her abortion. Her sisters helped her going through the rest of pregnancy, labour and my first year in this world. Then my dad finally had the balls to divorce his wife and came to the mother of her last kid. Nowadays, they're husband and wife and parents of a healthy 17 years old girl.

But I've seen around several Redditors here on this subreddit either born from rape/incest or were rape/incest victims themselves but still proceeded with the pregnancy even when they had a good reason not to. The stories of these people have caught my attention and going after having explored other discussions on YouTube or even in other subreddits, there seems to be an unheard amount of people who were rape/incest babies or victims themselves who are living perfectly fine and sharing their stories in these said platforms.

PC’s argument changed a LOT in this debate,"was debating with a vegetarian PC-er:

- her initial point was that ability to feel pain should determine if a being is worthy of life.
- i countered it by asking if she would still be vegetarian if the animal couldn’t feel pain.
- she said yes and said she doesn’t think ability to feel pain should determine the worthiness of life, but consciousness—awareness that one is alive—should.
- i responded citing a study that found that born babies do not have awareness of life until 5 months old at the earliest.
- she said her opinion about consciousness being the determinant doesn’t apply to born babies, only unborn ones.

so it’s clear that she actually believes that only born babies are worthy of life, and unborn babies are not. ability to feel pain and consciousness aren’t even factors. so why did she even try to mention them?

Just realized something.,"Was debating with someone about abortion and I realized something. Every time I disputed an argument with why human life  is unconditional and abortions were unethical, she kept saying “well what about those poor rape victims” or “what about those with financial struggles” or what about xyz. I’m pretty sure the goal here was to catch me with a curveball (it didn’t work) but I noticed she spent more time changing the circumstance to try to get me to say abortion was okay in some situations instead of actually backing up her argument.

It made me realize I see this a lot in pro choicers. When you disagree with them, often times they will give up certain parts of their argument to focus on another one. Whereas (most) pro-lifers I see have arguments for all circumstances and are consistent in their arguments.

I've become pro-life because pro-choicers are hypocrites.,"Pro-choice people support a woman's right to have an abortion even if the man is against it, which is perfectly fine. Your body, your choice.

But most of them oppose a man's right to get a paper abortion. Why don't they support ""My money, my choice"". 

If you can have bodily autonomy, why can't I have financial autonomy? Why should I be enslaved to your child for 18 years and shell out a fortune?

Women keep saying, ""If you didn't want to pay child support, you shouldn't have had sex.""

So now my position is the same for them. If you didn't want to get pregnant, you shouldn't have had sex.""

"The pro-aborts side only ""moral argument"" is money.","Thinking about this a long time and every single pro-abort argument and how they back up these arguments are always based on money.

They constantly say ""Well what if the mother isn't ready?"" People endure things all the time they aren't ready for: You aren't ready to have to move, you aren't ready to have kidney stones, you aren't ready for that big promotion that has been handed to you at work. Not being ready is not the excuse, it's money that is an excuse.

They always move the argument then into ""Well what if they can't financially support the child?"" So what? Being poor doesn't mean you are not capable of a better life, being poor doesn't mean you can't work hard for your child, being poor doesn't mean your child needs to die.

And when anti-murder laws get passed what do the pro-aborts do? They threaten to sue, they threaten to pull their money out of a location. They declare it loud and proud ""For daring to protect the lives of children, we will take your money! We will work to get you fired from your jobs! You must support the murder of your children!""

In the end that is why many ""support"" what the pro-aborts want: Fear of being financially ruined. Fear of losing their jobs. Fear of being blacklisted. Fear of being protested at outside of their business.

The only more ground pro-aborts have is money, once you are willing to look them in the eye and say ""I don't care about money"" they lose all power, they lose all standing they had. They are literally standing on a loose pile of cash and the only thing you have to do is not care about it.",t2_lxmbf,1632839130,prolife

I mean a woman's body is naturally wired both bodily and mentally to protect her baby. Of course for some people that wiring can be damaged. So why would we treat these women any differently that if they have postpartum or prenatal depression? Those women need help and we have systems in place to provide it.

Killing vs. Let Die(And the morality of killing),"I want to get into the distinction between killing and let die. I'm pro-choice, but I want to explore with pro-lifers the potentially blurry lines of killing vs. letting die. I also want to explore a good definition of killing vs. letting die. I also want to get into which definition of killing would seem to show abortion in bad lights. There may be cases in which you've killed someone on accident, but we'd probably say that you did nothing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's define killing as this: If one intentionally brings about a state of affairs such that a living being ceases to exist, then one has killed that living being.

Let's define letting die as this: If one doesn't intentionally bring about or play a causal role in making a living being cease to exist, then one has merely let that living being die.

I think we can agree that not giving your blood to someone on the other side of the world who you've never even known can't really be considered killing them. You've merely let them die because you had no intention of bringing about the state of affairs in which they die. 

Let's say that your son is in a critical condition and he needs blood from you because only your blood type is compatible. If you refused, I don't think anyone would say that you killed him. You didn't intend to kill him, although one could argue that you intentionally withheld resources from him thus intentionally bringing about a state of affairs which your son is in a deprived state and thus will die from it. We wouldn't think however that the state should be involved in this scenario even if it's potentially immoral. We wouldn't think that this would be an act of killing either. But let's just grant that this doesn't meet the first definition.

Let's say that there's a murderer chasing after a man, and that man goes into your house. You find them in your house, and you know that there's a murderer chasing after that man, and you still decide to kick out the man. You have intentionally brought about a state affairs such that a living being ceases in the sense that you intentionally played a causal role in bringing about the conditions where the murderer catches and kills the man. And yet, I don't think this is an act of killing. This seems to be an act of letting die.

The pro-lifer's response could be that you didn't intend to bring about their death, or that you didn't bring them into their needy condition, so it can't be classified as killing another person.

Perhaps then we should edit our definition of killing to include: If one intentionally brings about a state of affairs such that a living being ceases to exist, and if it was one's primary goal to have that living being cease, then one has killed that living being. 

Or perhaps another definition to include the needy condition response: If one intentionally brings about a state of affairs such that a living being is placed in a needy condition which will inevitably lead to their deaths assuming they have no sustaining or perpetuating cause, and one deprives them of that sustaining or perpetuating cause, then one has killed that living being.

Or perhaps one could have a definition with a combination of both principles which I'm too lazy to articulate here.

There are problems with both of these definitions however which seem to undermine the pro-life cause.

1. The goal of abortion isn't necessarily to kill a human fetus, rather it's to remove the fetus from the body. I'm sure there are some weird people who try to get abortions for the purpose of killing, but that doesn't necessarily seem to be the case for a majority of abortions, although correct me if I'm wrong.
2. If one assumes the second definition, then one runs into the problem with the fact that many people who engage in the act of sex don't necessarily have the intention of getting pregnant, and yet many do. So abortion doesn't meet that criteria either. So I don't think removing the fetus from the body even if it causes the fetus to die really meets this definition of killing, at least in a large number of cases.

Perhaps we can try to further edit the definition of killing: If one brings about a state of affairs either intentionally or unintentionally such that a person is brought into a needy condition which will inevitably lead to their deaths assuming they have no sustaining or perpetuating cause, and one deprives them of that sustaining or perpetuating cause, then one has killed that living being.

There are problems with this definition as well. Suppose there's a button that gives you cake, but it has a chance to blow up a church with a bunch of people in it. You press the button, not knowing of the church that has been blown up. You just wanted to get some cake. Yes, you've killed them, but did you do anything wrong? No. If one of the half-blown up church-goers crawled to you and said ,""give me your blood, you did this to us"", would it be wrong to refuse blood? Not really. 

The pro-lifer could then say ""aha, this definition of killing isn't fully analogous to abortion, because people still know of the consequences of sex, where as you didn't know the consequences of pressing the button.""

Let's think of one last definition and scenario: If one brings about a state of affairs either intentionally or unintentionally such that a person is brought into a needy condition which will inevitably lead to their deaths assuming they have no sustaining or perpetuating cause, and one was aware that engaging in certain actions could potentially bring about that state of affairs, and one deprives them of that sustaining or perpetuating cause, then one has killed that living being.

Now for the scenario. Let's say that you're a scientist. An alien lets you press a button to hyper-accelerate the technological process of luxury experimental foods, which gives you a lot of pleasure, however,the alien tells you that there's a 30% chance that pressing the button could also bring a person into a needy condition and fuses you with them to sustain their life. You press the button, and the unfortunate event happens. You however find device can unfuse yourself from their body, which deprives them of necessary resources which allows them to die. You use the device to unfuse yourself. Is this wrong? I don't think so. I don't think you have an obligation to stay fused with them, but that's my intuitions personally. Even if it was wrong, should the state be involved? Probably not.

So I don't think this definition of killing really helps the pro-life cause either.",t2_4xk5604i,1632794987,prolife

The other, sadly, my cousins son has. Do not know the name of it but his organs were not all inside his body when he was born. So he has pretty much been having surgeries since birth.  And although he tries, he will never graduate high school or have a real productive life. Not saying he isn't a good kid. Just saying it is kind of sad. He was in fetal distress during pregnancy but was not viable to be removed. She would not abort. She took off when she realized that he was too much too take care of and not the perfect child who would give her unconditional love.",t2_5umj70q4,1632539836,prolife

My teacher gave us an online document with tons of different political issues and told us to write if we supported, opposed, or were indifferent to the issue. I went throughout the list. And about halfway through I got to abortion. I’m extremely prolife but I just couldn’t get myself to write anything. Anytime I’ve mentioned my prolife beliefs everyone hates me. There’s never a respectful debate, always insults and (if it’s online) dislikes/downvotes. I just couldn’t bring myself to type “oppose”. And now I’m just really upset with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

September 24, 2021

Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments on [Nancy Pelosi's latest defense of abortion](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001xxfJZ8arKkjzgZobTy38ZXsRJTl9xWY-Esnd7GgXgjUFOeoWd6_HtntxggkEfAHXQrWelagPrHQtN8EoVHC-rxDwF_pQ-SX8aG02B4hXS7NfEO_aoiqVsHJyNTJLlE2wKJ7bi0XDML7_N8xHLJahVBOxQN6dK9L5GpZGCAEiwKOuy2sbrr-e2bYyZYqgqoSl&amp;c=M4hHmIZxq4iMiZIE5TwOXI_lao7iC3Rpnli7oKq8oV45Icxy0ifRHA==&amp;ch=8iqE8kmsDjDQSbPfHtMrwOKUSMB76UH86pxLPoyG4jbm_Uz5S-ggvg==):

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who identifies as a Catholic, was asked at her weekly press briefing to reply to comments made by San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone that were critical of the Women's Health Protection Act, a radical pro-abortion bill. ""You're a Catholic,"" the reporter said. ""What's your reaction?""

Here is what she said (she ended with a reference to Cordileone expressing her disagreement).

""Yeah, I'm Catholic. I come from a pro-life family. Not active in that regard. Different in their view of a woman's right to choose than I am. In my right to choose, I had five children in six years and one week. And I keep saying to people who say things like that, when you have five children in six years and one day, we can talk about what business it is of us to tell anyone else \[what\] to do. For us, it was a complete and total blessing, which we enjoy every day of our lives. But it is none of our business how other people choose the size and timing of their families.""

The key word is ""view."" It is Pelosi's ""view"" that her pro-life family, and the teachings of the Catholic Church, are wrong on abortion.

A view is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""an opinion or judgment colored by the feeling or bias of it holder.""

Have you ever heard someone say that it his ""view"" that there are 12 months in the year? That would make it rebuttable. No, what people say is that *there are* 12 months in a year. They speak declaratively. It is not an opinion.

The pope recently said that abortion is ""murder,"" and Archbishop Cordileone called it ""child murder."" Neither argued that it was his ""view."" Indeed, the pope said that ""any book on embryology"" makes clear that life begins at conception.

If disagreements on abortion amount to nothing more than different ""views,"" as Pelosi contends, then why wouldn't disagreements on slavery amount to the same? Consider what a pro-slavery ""Catholic"" might say if asked how to reply to his archbishop on the merits of slavery.

""Yeah, I'm Catholic. I come from an abolitionist family. Not active in that regard. Different in their view of a slavemaster's right to choose than I am. In my right to choose, I bought five children in six years and one week. And I keep saying to people who say things like that, when you have bought five children in six years and one day, we can talk about what business it is of any of us to tell anyone else \[what\] to do. For us, it was a complete and total blessing, which we enjoy every day of our lives. But it is none of our business whether other people choose to own slaves.""

Those who oppose slavery and abortion rest their case on moral absolutes, not opinion. Pelosi's moral relativism places her outside the Catholic community.

A Confused Thought Experiment,"I recently came across the thought experiment which goes along these lines: If a six-year old girl and 10 embryos were in a burning building, which would you save? At first, I wasn't quite sure how to approach this question, with it obviously having a basis in the Abortion argument and who holds ""more value"". Then I realized that this is still not a thought Experiment which represents abortion as a situation.

This relies on the idea that both the girl (meant to represent the mother) and the embryos (meant to represent... well, the unborn) are in danger of losing their lives in the context of the pregnancy. This is obviously not the case for the vast number of pregnancies, especially given modern prenatal technology and advancement. In those few cases where the mother and Zygote/Embryo/Fetus (ZEF) are both in danger, precedent is clearly taken to preserve and protect the life which has a greater chance of continuing existence, which, in most cases, would be the mother. In this case, I can clearly still say I would save the girl while still consistently valuing human life as a concept and right.

A more appropriate version of this comparison to (most) abortions would be a burning building with embryos inside and the little girl outside (or something to that extent). Do y'all have similar conclusions on this?",t2_91ttmem3,1632438208,prolife

My point is, if a person has not been fully formed or conscious yet, and we have the evidence to prove that he would be born with a severe terminal illness or a handicap, why not give the choice to the people who are going to spend a significant portion of their lives and resources caring for that child to terminate that pregnancy before the baby's brain forms and is fully conscious.

Pro-Choice Person Wondering What Pro-Life People Think,"So I am pro-choice because I consider the moral value of an agent to be dependent on whether or not it can suffer, and also whether or not it has a consciousness that can be disturbed, hurt, or taken away.

(source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440624/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440624/), 3rd paragraph below Figure 1) That combined with the fact that the VAST majority of abortions are performed before 23 weeks (1% occur after or during the 21st week of pregnancy, source: [https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data\_stats/abortion.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm)), I have nothing against abortion in general. Of course, I support government restrictions after 23 weeks (except in the cases of rape or danger to the mother or viability of the fetus). I do have a biased respect for embryos and fetuses (because I am human and spiritual) but I feel this should have no bearing on the laws of a secular government, which should only consider objective facts (like those found in science) as evidence rather than religious dogma or political/personal bias.

A callous question,"I am a fan of the 'safe, legal and rare position' and to me, the heartbeat position is a fairly reasonable position (you've got 6 weeks, that's a decent amount of time). However, I had a thought the other day. Keep in mind I am approach this from a secular, libertarian viewpoint (although I will include some religious elements). 

Even though I just mentioned safe, legal and rare, I personally would never convince/propose that my partner gets one. I think it is a barbarous practice that we will look back on with shame. However, depravity seems to be edging its way into our culture these days. Additionally, the political divide within the US seems to be strengthening the conservative base within smaller communities in the select few states that they exist in. So my proposition is thus: why don't we let the depraved have their abortions and simply outcompete them in the biological sense (as in, have more children and raise them better)? 

I've used the following religious lense on members of my family who are devout people of faith: temptation to commit evil exists in the world, and your obligation is to attempt to stop it when feasible correct? Does this mean you feel obligated to stop the murder of a child hundreds of miles away when your vote actually means nothing? Wouldn't a much more effective strategy be to convince women in your local town to not have abortions/teach your children responsibility with regards to sexual activity? 

Additionally, leading by example is normally much more effective than essentially collectively hiring someone to do it for you (which is what voting really is).",t2_yb7g9,1632393612,prolife

My mother raised me to understand that anyone seeking abortion is a murderer and will be destined for Hell. For years, this is all I really knew or understood about abortion. As a kid, occasionally I'd ask for brothers or sisters. My mom would tear up and I never understood why. Until I was 20... My mom also developed cervical cancer, which was spreading worse after an attempt to surgically remove it. I was in the hospital room when the her new oncologist came by... ""Any previous surgeries? All of them you can list...""
3 abortions were listed. I didn't initially feel bad for my mom. I felt lied to. I felt absolutely misled. I also didn't change my stance, abortion was murder.

One thing I haven't mentioned that is crucial to mention now, my parents had agreed early on in their marriage... One kid. One. That was me. They both stuck to that, no more abortions... a vasectomy for my father and my mother had her tubes tied... One kid.

If my mom had not had an abortion at all... They would've already had one kid. There wouldn't have been 2 other abortions. There wouldn't have been me. I wouldn't exist without my mother being able to choose when they decided to actually have a kid. When people say ""every life is sacred"" and that there shouldn't be a choice... It feels like a slap in my face. My life doesn't feel sacred when people don't respect the path that brought me here too. I'm sure there are other people, like me, who are alive today because their parents had the choice. That choice obviously weighed hard on my mom years later, enough that she silently condemned herself everytime she told me that ""people who get abortions are going to Hell"". It still doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't exist if it wasn't for abortions.

I exist because of pro-choice, not pro-life. That's why I'm pro-choice.
The debate on when a life truly begins, conception or otherwise is a much deeper conversation. I have my own thoughts, but this isn't the place or time. I was sharing my side, no science, no religion (aside from my mom and the Hell speeches). 

Just as deep as when does life begin is how many lives happen because of abortion? And, now, you can't say none... You've met one. And if every life is sacred... Those lives matter too. My life matters. 

(Also, sorry... I couldn't choose which flair best suit this post, obviously not my own abortion story, but a bit more about my mom's)",t2_61apxwbu,1632335357,prolife

I believe the government should have very little control over citizens lives, most republicans believe this.

However I just find it odd that no one is getting forced to get an abortion, as many horror stories you can make up most people who get abortions do it within their own will- I don’t think anyone will argue against this.

But why do many libertarian republicans support increasing government regulation to make abortions harder? Does this contradict the whole idea of libertarianism?",t2_41vhdf4e,1632306093,prolife

"Do Not Enlighten Me: Or, how /r/prochoice asks questions they do not want the answers to","Reddit, as a Left-leaning social media platform, often occasions crossposts which are occasions for brigading and other toxic behavior. Occasionally, however, they appear to invite greater dialogue among groups. Group A and Group B have overlapping interests; therefore crossposts enable Groups A and B to interact in a positive way. Alas, it appears only the former is the case on /r/prochoice, and not the latter - even when they explicitly say that it is. 

Several users there seemed confused as to the following:

&gt; can someone enlighten me on how, calling an individual a “pregnant person” gives more handmaidens-tale vibes than your pro life laws that are killing women?

This question was generated with screencaps from a conversation on this subreddit. The replies on /r/prochoice are... disturbing in their ignorance. I figured I would chime in and offer an answer to this user's question. After all, they asked the question, surely they want the answer, right? Ergo, I offered the following explanation in answer to the user's own question and the various nonsensical replies offered in response to it: 

&gt; I'm not quite certain any of you understand the arguments being made here. Rather than try, you're just leaping to whatever low-hanging fruit you think someone who you think your opponent is like would make (""obviously they're a stupid, no-good, rotten &lt;preferred identity&gt; hater"" et al).

&gt; First, the pro-choice response on the image above is... ridiculous in its smugness. Whoever wrote it should probably take a step back from the ""compared to my towering intellect, everyone around me is a child I must stoop to"" vibe. They're not going to do anything but alienate literally everyone who would bother to read their response by being so patronizing.

&gt; Second, the pro-life responses on the pictured thread indicate an understanding of man and woman resembling something along the lines of of the following:


&gt; Man: a human person ordered toward insemination


&gt; Woman: a human person ordered toward gestation

&gt; Man and woman understood in this way have distinct natures and ordered purposes. Obviously, if you don't accept the paradigm that we are born with ordered natures (if you accept, for example, that existence precedes essence - that we can define ourselves however we wish and that is who we are), then you won't accept the paradigm in which men and women exist as concretely distinct from one another. This is usually the view of existentialists, humanists, social constructionists... Most of you probably fall under this umbrella. Given what I'm reading here, I would be shocked if any of you did not fall under this umbrella. If you don't think you do, or don't consider yourself to, fine. Whatever. That isn't an exhaustive list of individuals who would hold to a view along the lines of ""existence precedes essence.""

&gt; As it is, inb4 ""what about women who can't get pregnant/XXY/XXXY/XXXXY/elderly people"" - the phrase ""ordered toward"" does not imply perfection function, e.g. a person does not require perfect function of their distinctly ordered parts to be considered within that distinct order. Some defect in function does not remove the underlying order of the function. Blindness in the eye, for example, does not indicate that a blind individual is not ordered toward possessing sight. It merely requires some restoration of the proper function of the eyes to achieve this.

&gt; Note that in this post I am not judging your views. I am not violating any of the rules of this subreddit. In fact, I am following the rules of this subreddit as stated in the sidebar. I am merely explaining to you, who may be struggling to understand ""what is going on here"" (rather than simply raging at their keyboards), what precisely is going on: that, for someone who does not hold the views that you do - and I am not here to argue your views, you can think whatever you wish and you can bombard me with links to whatever literature you desire (I am already familiar with most of it, I assure you) in order to ""smash"" me ""with facts and logic"" - the underlying biological differences (which play a large, but not total, part of the definitions given above) between man and woman are important, and it is precisely the underlying human biology which indicates that ""pregnant person"" depersonalizes women, as it is part of womens' unique role that they are ordered toward gestation. In removing this distinction, in the view as explained above, you diminish the role of women.

&gt; That is what is happening here. Agree, disagree, whatever. At least make the attempt to understand before you criticize.

"My abortion 6 years ago, loss of identity, conflicting feelings, and uncertainty","I imagine many of you will read this story and shudder at the kind of person I am. Maybe you will think I’m a monster. I don’t know why I’m posting here. I don’t know how to come to terms with my abortion. I’m sorry this is long, I want to give my entire experience. 

I was pregnant at 20. Just starting college in a southern town. My parents and almost everyone I knew Christians. I had sex out of wedlock. I thought of this as a victimless crime. One night he didn’t use a condom. I was drunk and stupid. My biggest regret and moment of absolute disappointment of myself was making this choice. I consider myself a responsible person but this period of time haunts me as a time of foolishness and poor decisions. What was I thinking? I wasn’t. I am ashamed to admit I barely knew him. 

I wrestled with my own religious views and had been secretly agnostic for awhile. I always wanted a “stable” home for my children with two married parents who were committed and loved each other. I only knew of one person in my town who was raised by a single mom, my ex boyfriend, and he experienced a lot of pain and trauma from not having a father figure and the men his mother dated coming in and out of his life. I didn’t want my kid to grow up without a father, and I didn’t trust the man I chose to have sex with as being the father I imagined having kids with. I didn’t want my kid to grow up hurting because of a stupid decision I made. 


I thought about adoption. I read mixed information. I read about the risks and dangers of foster care and felt guilty that I would birth a child and toss it away to become someone else’s responsibility. But maybe it would end up with two loving parents in a stable home. 

I googled abortion. The thought originally made me sick. I read a lot about abortion on Reddit trying to find women who had been in similar situations. After reading about a fetus being unable to feel pain or having any sort of consciousness in the early weeks and convincing myself that an abortion would prevent any risk of suffering due to my sin, I decided to abort. I had the belief that the fetus was a growing into a “potential life” but not yet comparable to a newborn. 

At the time I believe it felt easy to unintentionally dehumanize the fetus. I didn’t look pregnant, I didn’t feel pregnant. I only found out I was pregnant because my period is always on time and I was late. 6 years later I still don’t know who I am. I don’t even elect to kill bugs if I don’t have to (usually catch and release if they are in my house or I leave them alone), I love people and babies and animals. At the time of my abortion I was donating to Compassion International, a charity that helps children in need. Yet here I am knowing I killed my unborn child.

I wrestle with knowing the fetus had no consciousness, felt no pain, was developing in my body and was hardly developed. What value do (should) I place here? I don’t know. Then another part of me feels like a monster for taking away the future of my unborn child.

I was pregnant at 20. Just starting college in a southern town. My parents and almost everyone I knew Christians. I had sex out of wedlock. I thought of this as a victimless crime.

I wrestled with my own religious views and had been secretly agnostic for awhile. I always wanted a “stable” home for my children with two parents who were committed and loved each other. I only knew of one person in my town who was raised by a single mom, my ex boyfriend, and he experienced a lot of pain and trauma from not having a father figure and the men his mother dated coming in and out of his life. I didn’t want my kid to grow up without a father, and I didn’t trust the man I chose to have sex with as being the father I imagined having kids with. I didn’t want my kid to grow up hurting because of a stupid decision I made. 


I thought about adoption. I read mixed information. I read about the risks and dangers of foster care and felt guilty that I would birth a child and toss it away to become someone else’s responsibility. But maybe it would end up with two loving parents in a stable home. 

I googled abortion. The thought originally made me sick. I read a lot about abortion on Reddit trying to find women who had been in similar situations. After reading about a fetus being unable to feel pain or having any sort of consciousness in the early weeks and convincing myself that an abortion would prevent any risk of suffering due to my sin, I decided to abort. I had the belief that the fetus was a growing into a “potential life” but not yet comparable to a newborn. 

At the time I felt it was easy to dehumanize the fetus. I didn’t look pregnant, I didn’t feel pregnant. I only found out I was pregnant because my period is always on time and I was late. 6 years later I still don’t know who I am. I don’t even elect to kill bugs if I don’t have to (usually catch and release if they are in my house or I leave them alone), I love people and babies and animals.

"Personhood, as it relates to Pro-Life and Pro-Choice:","Hello, I am new to the Pro-Life stance and I have a few fundamental questions that I would like answered. My contentions as some may have surmised due to what new posts often ask; “how does one establish when life begins against someone using the consciousness argument and how does one refute the bodily autonomy argument?” 

For replies, I would prefer them to be specific to each point, question, or thought experiment I place forward. Also, I would not like answers appealing to the bible, if the bible must be referenced, please provide context as to why the bible finds that position immoral or moral. 

To begin, I shall present a hypothetical used by Pro-achievers. 

&gt;”A man is driving his car drunk and crashes into someone else’s car, the crash causes the victim to loose blood, can the state force the drunk man to provide his bodily autonomy for the victim?”

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some refutations that may be utilized would suggest that the fetus is not part of the women’s body, but the fetus is relying on the women’s autonomy hence, the analogy is analogous. Thus, what is another response that may be utilized? 

Another common argument utilized by Pro-Choicer’s is that personhood ought to be granted consideration at the first conscious experience because they believe that current, past and future consciousness is required for personhood.

Please help me understand Pro life ideology.,"I am a 20 year old female and I am very very pro choice. I do have an open mind and I believe I’m very smart. I consider myself an empath, so I want to understand pro choice. I have had a very hard time understanding because I think I’m a very moral person and I just want to do what’s right. I feel so torn because my boyfriend of almost two years agreed with me about it being a woman’s choice and now that he’s getting closer to church he doesn’t agree with me anymore. I am so hurt because I want to agree with him but every fiber in my body doesn’t think it’s his right to have an opinion. Only God’s. I understand what Christians and pro lifers believe, but I don’t think they should be the deciders of any woman’s body. I want to understand him I do. I promise I want to understand because it is hurting me so emotionally that we don’t agree. I believe that only some situations warrant an abortion. For example, I think rape and incest warrant the right to an abortion. I believe if the child is going to have a very short painful life of suffering if they are both it warrants an abortion. And I believe if having the child threatens a woman’s life it warrants an abortion. But my boyfriend thinks it’s black or white. He says that he is pro choice no matter what. But I don’t understand why the baby’s life should take priority over a woman’s life.I’m sure there are many Women who would want to sacrifice their life for their baby’s life, but I believe that should be a decision only a woman can make for herself. I don’t think babies that are almost fully grown should be aborted unless there is this extreme circumstance. Also when kids are raped or haven’t even had their first period and get pregnant, I think an abortion is more than reasonable as it’s traumatic for a child to go through that. I truly want to understand and I truly want to know why he thinks or maybe you all think that a woman still shouldn’t have the choice to have an abortion. Please help me understand because I truly want to empathize and be of moral reasoning. I don’t believe in God but I think I am very good at being open minded to others opinions. I also brought up the fact that he could get me pregnant and that I would definitely consider abortion given the circumstance, especially if the baby threatened my life. He says that I should stop trying to convince him and that if it’s God’s timing, it’s God’s timing but I think it’s not fair because he will never even have a baby so how could he be the one to decide. Please be kind
 as I am just trying to understand you all and him.

I've always been pro choice but now I'm not sure,"Im a 35 year old man with 1 child. Im a lifelong atheist and I have liberal leaning worldviews so anything presented to the contrary would probably not be very effective at reaching me, I guess. Ive pretty much gone along with the flow of ""clump of cells, no uterus/no opinion"" etc and stayed out of it. Fast forward to my ex wife's first ultrasound at 7 weeks, seeing my baby's heartbeat on the screen, and falling in love. 3 weeks later I got the phone call informing me that I have a son on the way. I was so happy and excited to be a dad and I got all the baby books and signed up for the pregnancy emails that tell you what's happening every week of the pregnancy as your baby develops. Doubts about my views started creeping in during the first trimester after seeing my son on the screen and reading about his recent and upcoming developments. These first weeks really started humanizing what I had always thought of as some inconsequential blob of cells. Really thinking about it all went to the wayside as the pregnancy progressed and I prepared for the arrival of my son. Ive spent the last few years just keeping it out of my mind until recently, when my home state passed some extremely restrictive abortion laws. The topic is unavoidable now and im just not sure how I feel anymore. Since I've been living under a rock, I recently started looking into the kermit gosnell case. I had known about it before, but really didn't know how horrific the case truly was until I started researching it. I listened to a podcast this morning that advised not to look at the evidence photos because ""it looks like a baby"" . Naturally I want to see that shit so I look it up and I cant describe how horrific the imagery is. ""Looks like a baby"" because these are actual viable newborns that were born alive and murdered but theyre still being called fetuses. They're murdered newborns. Now I can't help but obsessively wonder how many monsters like this are flying under the radar, if reputable clinics are crossing lines in secret etc. I just can't stop thinking about it. So now I'm surrounded by angry pro choice friends and im silent with doubts and big feelings I don't know how to process. 
That's not to say I don't have issues with many pro lifers too. I think too many people are just pro birth and while I want to see children born, I also want them cared for and loved. We've got a foster system that's overwhelmed with overlooked children and too many neglectful and abusive people. I see too many people that want a child born but in another post will slam free lunches and social programs that can help with the financial burdens of parenthood. I dont want sexually abused children being made to carry a pregnancy but I also dont want that baby to die. I dont want women who are pregnant from an attack made to live with that but I also dont want that baby to die. So right now I'm just stuck with these big and conflicting feelings and I dont know how to rationalize any of it. I dont even know where to start. I dont even know what im hoping to get out of this. I just know I can't say anything around present company.",t2_9lyswwun,1632088605,prolife

3 Ways To Make Abortion Unthinkable - Catholicism Coffee Article,,t2_8bxytcqk,1631985915,prolife
Ways the prolife movement shoots itself in the foot,"I converted to Catholicism, and I had never really looked at the prolife cause in any depth.  Well, I was obligated by my new faith to be prolife, so I had a look to see if it was as terrible as it seemed.  Turns out I was wrong about that too.  Guess I'm on your team now.

Ways that prolifers shoot themselves in the foot and make it really easy for prochoicers:

1) The language sometimes gets so hyperbolic that the prochoicer doesn't even need an argument.  Sometimes, yall sound crazy. Just like most other social/political movements, the prolife-prochoice debate isn't had on stages or at rallies.  It is had at dinner tables between family members and between friends.  The moment you talk about genocide or hiring a hitman, you have lost the argument because the person you're talking to thinks you are insane.  

I cannot stress this enough. The strategy for dealing with a rabid prolifer is to just let them talk.  The prochoicer just stands back and says ""well, I don't agree with any of that.  I think this teenager should go to college.""

2) there are way fewer pro-abortionists than there are prochoicers. Most people just want to be a good person.  Notice that politicians- filthy and duplicitous slime that they are- cannot usually firmly commit to prolife or prochoice.  The prochoicer talks about freeing a woman from an antiquated system of subjugation. ""Don't you think this woman should be able to have a career? This woman was raped.  Why should she be punished.""  Most prochoice people don't want to be associated with the far right.  Use some leftist arguments to attack this assumption. (I will give some.)

3) The prochoice cause is inherently racists, abelist, and classist. ~75% of women who ""choose"" abortion come from the lowest two income quintiles.  (75% are really poor.)  And, all together now, it disproportionately effects black and brown communities. Sanger called the birth control movement the ""N*gro project"" because she thought there were too many black people.  Bill Gates has arrived at the same conclusion for Africa.  Too many black people.  

That means that the question is not ""do I want kids?"".  It is ""can I afford to take time off of work for doctors appointments or delivery?  Can I pay for daycare?""  

This is why it must be dressed up as rights movement.

4) Iceland has ""cured"" Downs syndrome by aborting every fetus who tests positive for it.  This is a strange double think that can be exploited.  Almost 100% of humans would say a person with downs has value.  To prevent their birth is to say that it would have been better if those with downs had never been born.  This is an incredibly shaky position the prochoicers have taken.

Here's the skinny: this exposes the truth behind the prochoice position.  ""We should regulate who should and who should not be born.""  That's eugenics plain and simple.

5) Support for the death penalty- especially callous and vitriolic support- undercuts the prolife position.  Clearly this person believes there is a circumstance in which it is fitting to end a life.  Now we are just negotiating terms.  

6) Since the prolife cause is taken up (mostly) by conservatives, some of the far right stuff gets in the way.  If I were arguing with you, I would ask if you supported abortion.  ""No."" Then I would ask you if you supported paid maternity leave or free/low cost to user Healthcare for babies.  If the answer was no, I would ask you whether or not that baby's life was valuable and worth saving.  There is a doublethink here that shows (especially to prochoicers).  I'm sure you have heard it said of you ""They aren't prolife. They're just pro-birth.""

Most of us don't live in an idyllic Mayberry-esque place.  We live in the real world.  Wages are low and bills are high.  There was a priest on Matt Fradd's show who described a family sitting around the table deciding whether they wanted a fourth child.  He went on to assume that was the norm.  It isn't. The entire narrative needs to get honest.  I assure you, the prolife position is ascendant when the facts are considered together.

7) Protests don't work.  Strikes work. Revolutions work. Protests don't.  They are mutal admiration societies. Run for office.  Find a good candidate and help that person run.  You don't have to be on the Supreme Court to change the trajectory of abortion.  There are so many resources being wasted at the local level.  Getting elected to a county council or city council can help the prolife movement.  

I'll stick this here.  Medicaid actually does a good job of covering medical bills associated with pregnancy. Anything to expand that would help.  My girlfriend got pregnant and we were in the medicaid gap (made too much for medicaid but too little to buy insurance).  We aborted the first child because we decided we wouldn't raise a child in poverty.  We had to let the electric bill go to afford the pill ($500).  Later, lack of Healthcare resulted in two miscarriages.  

8) Roe v Wade.  The Supreme Court did not say ""abortion is cool now"".  It struck down the 1971 Texas law because of how it was written.  The law basically said that pregnant women can't get abortions.  The 14th Amendment says you can't write a law that only effects one group of people.  So, write a law that grants citizenship at conception.  This isn't rocket science. We were all afraid the republicans were going to do it in 2016. The new Texas law is written cleverly, so that might work.

9) About 50% of abortions are done by taking two pills.  The pills force a miscarriage. The next 25% or so are done using a vacuum.  That leaves about 25% that are done surgically. That doesn't make it ok, but it does make you look like an idiot if you start describing some Frankenstein-esque scene where a doctor is ripping limbs off of a baby.  

10) There is a strange prochoicer position within the conservative camp.  It is all very secretive, but you hear stories about good Christian parents driving their deviant daughter to planned parenthood to cover up her mistake.  I dont know how large of a contingent this is, but that weird dynamic is a shot through the heart of the prolife movement. ""See, they say no abortion for the poor black teenager, but when it's their daughter, she doesn't deserve to be held back by one mistake.""

"Do you think to be ethically consistent, pro lifers should be vegan?","I've seen many pro choicers claim that it's hypocritical that pro lifers are against abortion at all stages, yet are perfectly fine eating meat, consuming animal products, wearing fur coats etc etc. When of course those products come from literal billions of animals being killed and in many cases being horrifically abused and kept in poor conditions before hand, every single year, and there is no denying more suffering is going on here than in abortions, not to mention animal agriculture effects on the environment and such, and how the vast majority of people simply don't need to eat meat, or consume animal products to live a healthy life anymore. And for the most part I completely agree with this which is why I'm a pro life vegan. But what are your thoughts? If you're vegan do you think being pro life but not vegan is ethically inconsistent and vice versa? And if you aren't vegan why?

My name is Luuk and I'm a Master student Sociology from Tilburg University, in The Netherlands. Me and three fellow students are conducting a small research about motives for Pro-Lifers to participate in their social movement. Because of this, we are looking for respondents (preferably males) to interview. At the moment we are only looking for one (last) respondent, but have trouble finding the last one. So my question to you all is the following: would anyone be prepared to be interviewed about their motives to participate in Pro-Life and about the view on the matter of Pro-Life. Ofcourse the interview is anonymous, it can be conducted online and will take approximatelly 30 minutes of your time. Any other questions which one might have, may ofcourse be asked. I hope anyone fancies to be interviewed, it would help us out a lot, thanks in advance!

PoV from a pro-choice person,"This has probably been shared here, but I am new so I wanted your views on this. I am pro-choice, although I am completely sympathetic to pro-life arguments, particularly once the baby has a working central nerve system (i.e. can likely feel pain), has a heartbeat and a heart (heartbeat bills are stupid, well, because: science) and can likely be considered sentient.

But that's not my PoV. People talk on here about demonising Pro-lifers, I think that's a bit rich when I routinely called a child murder and agent of satan. My question is this: how many people on here who are pro-life also support access to birth control, better sex education (or in same places, sex education) and unfettered / confidential access to reproductive health care? Because if you're passionate about stopping abortions, this is the best tried and tested way to do it.

What doesn’t make any sense is for the pro-life stance to be so overwhelmingly demonized on a large scale, as if being pro-life is akin to being a Nazi or something. To demonize all pro-lifers in that way really does require you to be a complete dolt and entirely lacking in basic critical thinking and empathy.

When I see how so many pro-choicers argue, I can’t help but think of the meme where Manray is showing Patrick his driver’s license. So often, the arguments follow a pattern of pro-lifers explaining to pro-choicers that they don’t hate women, they just believe unborn children should have human rights. The pro-choicer will then hear all of this, they seem to understand it… and then they immediately fall back on claiming that they hate women.

It’s like they purposely shut their brains off just for the sake of not having to find any middle ground.",t2_11drap,1631701758,prolife

"As a young adult, I feel so isolated especially being a pro lifer. I feel so alone.","I'm just 21.. I'm very much an outlier. I've always been the odd one out. my brain is just wired differently. Younger people are more liberal and I'm more conservative. take mostly any take, such as BLM, defunding the police, ""privilege"" of any kind, such as white, male, or ""skinny"" privilege. And of course, abortion. 

I've come across plenty of girls and guys and they're usually liberal. the cutest ones are usually more moderate though. they don't have the annoying out there personalities, having sex be 90% of their personality with them handing out nudes and onlyfans like candy, etc. 

but due to younger people being more liberal, especially women with abortion, I can never see eye to eye with it and it usually kills any future possibility of a relationship.. they think banning abortion is trying to control women. in actuality that makes no sense. nobody cares enough to try to control them in such an esoteric way for basically no gain other than bragging rights. 

I just feel very isolated. It feels like nobody thinks the way I do. I'm not a monster. I'm not some ""[insert whatever here]-phobe. I'm not even religious, so my view of it isn't even based in religion. i know my brain is just wired significantly differently than everybody else my age, if not around me entirely. I've always been known as ""gifted"", presumably moreso by my psychiatrists and physicist guidance teacher who had experience with IQ. he had said that I am clearly more than gifted.

But then I go into real life and I struggle to make and keep relationships because it feels like I'm the dumb one. it feels like time and time again, I'm wrong that abortion is immoral. I'm wrong that sex should be cherished and not handed out. I'm wrong that defunding the police is a bad idea. I'm wrong about everything. it's isolating. I feel dumb.",t2_thmdy,1631678641,prolife

Vasalgel - Non hormonal reversible birth control for Men,"So one of the things I think will drastically reduce abortions is having contraceptives for Men.

I really think [Vasalgel](https://www.revolutioncontraceptives.com/vasalgel/) is promising

I think it's a better solution for a lot of reasons:

1. It's effective, I mean *they tested it on rabbits*
2. It's reversible.
3. It's non-hormonal, which means no effect on the brain
4. It removes a lot of pressure from Women to take a pill that can frankly really mess them up.
5. It solves the problem in an easier way by focusing on the simpler external reproductive system of men than the more complex internal reproductive system of women.
6. It gives men (who generally want kids less) the ability to fully prevent impregnating women they date, effectively eliminating much of the unwanted pregnancies we're seeing.
7. It has no impact on sensation unlike a condom (not that it's a good excuse to not use one and frankly if you're hooking up you should DEFINITELY be using one because STDs)
8. It gives men a more active role in reproduction, which means men will start asking the ""When/If/With Who"" question about children more, no longer will pregnancy be something to be afraid, but something to plan for.

Curious what the rest of your thoughts are, also curious what percentage of women feel like they get really sick from their birth control, but I guess that's a bit of an aside.

Would also be great if you'd explain your choices in the comments.

I kind of wish I could be pro-choice.,"I used to be pro-choice, and my entire family is pro-choice, with the exception of my grandfather who passed away.

However, for whatever reason, I just can't do it. No matter how many pro-choice videos and articles I read, I can't convince myself to be pro-choice again.

Need help with my dilemma.,"It hasn't been a very long time since I had my first stand on the topic of abortion, but since I finally had one, I've been constantly looking for arguments here and there which did shift it a bit, but I think I am not somewhere where I'd be confortable at.  


According to my view, any abortion is murder, but nontheless, it should be legal, or at least not punishable by law. That is, I think, somewhat contraversial to general ideas, as people have this need to believe they are doing something absolutely right (either it's not a murder and it's legal or it is and it is illegal), but I don't really care about it that much.  


My way of thinking, that might have to be changed is the following: abortion is murder, because there isn't any moment between conception and birth at which we'd be able to say: okay, it's a human being now. The only moment that can serve us well enough is conception itself, and the argument of ""Oh wow, my pregnancy test is positive, I wonder what it is, is it a bird, is it a plane? I wonder what's it going to be in 9 months, I have no idea!"" is ofc ridiculous for me.  


But I also do believe that any procedure (giving birth included) can only be done with that person's (or people responsible for said person) permission. If person considers a procedure too dangerous for them (fear for their life, health, etc), so if there is a chance for a mother could die or encounter serious health issues giving birth, surely she should be able to deny it and have an abortion. But there is always a chance... And Just like with a moment at which a baby is ""a baby"" and should not be killed, I have to admit the only chance at which mother should not be allowed to risk her health or life is exactly 0%, or else I am a huge hipocrite. And surely, 0% chances of having health issues cannot be reached, thus... abortions should be legal.   


In my own head, atm what we should do is to, at all costs, promote being pro-life and discorage killing babies, yet making it illegal and punishable by law seems incorrect to me. If you have some arguments that could change my mind or make me think, please be my guest.",t2_r9cvm,1631645120,prolife

How about pro-lifers redirect their focus towards things that can help women to avoid getting in that situation in the first place, such as advocating for laws that allow women to get their tubes tied/ hysterectomies WITHOUT needing their spouses permission and without age restrictions cause women in this day and age can’t get those until they are already close to menopause!

Is that all you would do while women walked into clinics with their children to have them legally murdered? I am absolutely sure this is not the case. I believe most people would help burn down the clinics, attack the doctors, risk their personal safety to put their bodies between the children and certain death. Do you see the point I am making?

"Abortion, entertainment, and the reaction of fans","So, the show Desperate Housewives has several plotlines involving unexpected/unwanted pregnancies and abortion never comes up. I never thought anything of this, honestly, but since finding fan communities online, I have seen massive amounts of people complain about it. And any defense, even if I don't admit to being pro-life (because it will just result in a fight and that's not what I'm looking for when chatting about a TV show I like) gets me downvoted into oblivion. 

Like even just pointing out that the show is from the mid-2000s, written by people from the Baby Boomer gen, about upper class suburban women in their 30s/40s. One of them is even devoutly religious and Conservative. Taking all of that into consideration, I don't think it's that far out of the realm of possibility that these characters never consider abortion. It's as if it is just inconceivable for some people to believe there are women who wouldn't ever see it appropriate to consider that or suggest it to someone else.

I happen to be one of those women, so seeing the characters deal with their pregnancies without abortion ever coming up did not seem strange to me at all lol. It just doesn't enter my head and even after all this time, I still get this little jolt of surprise when it comes up in entertainment. 

Roseanne is probably my #1 favorite show of all time. If you're unaware, abortion comes up when the titular character, Roseanne, has to deal with the possibility of something being wrong with her baby. This is always a low point in the show for me, honestly. It's pretty bad when you find yourself agreeing with the generally unlikable harpy mom, Bev, when she says ""if you're willing to lie on your back and have sex, you should be willing to deal with the consequences."" And the anti-abortion protestors are wholly portrayed as evil and sexist. I have never seen fans do anything but praise the episode.

It always especially makes me cringe when women who have kids consider abortion. I don't know how they could look at what they already have, think about killing the one they're carrying, and not see how that's like playing God.

The pro-choice Handmaid's Tale obsession makes me think we need a cultural reference point for our movement's goals.,"I don't think I've never seen a movie, book, or TV show that's featured an abortion ban in a non-dystopian, non-apocalyptic context. Whenever abortion restrictions show up in fiction, they're invariably either the first step in some sort of totalitarian takeover or a drastic, last-resort attempt to prevent human extinction.

Worlds in which abortion is illegal and society in general is just fine just don't seem to exist in American pop culture. And based on some of the reactions to Texas's abortion law, it seems like a lot of pro-choicers are incapable of imagining such a world. That someone could want to ban abortion but _not_ move on to legalizing spousal rape or revoking women's suffrage or whatever is literally inconceivable to them.

Just once, I want to see a fictional world where protecting the unborn is _normal_. Where abortion is just... a thing society has moved past. Where the abortion ban is just an ordinary bit of the worldbuilding, as opposed to being the start of some nefarious slippery slope or an indicator of how far society has fallen. Something we could point to and say _this_ is what we're fighting for.

Imagine that, a story where abortion is illegal and... that's it. The main story is about robots or mermaids or whatever. Picture a fantasy movie where the elves look down on the humans for killing their unborn young, or a space opera TV show where an android cites prenatal personhood as a time human rights have been expanded in the past. Maybe then people wouldn't be so certain that even the most modest restriction on late-term abortions can only be the first step towards red cloaks and rape cults.",t2_457pe,1631492087,prolife

Check out what a fetus looks like then. Absolutely not “a clump of cells” like they enjoy saying. I remember the ultrasounds from my own children at that age. You can count every finger and even see what the face looks like.

Epiphany,"So I've seen other people worrying about their friendships with prochoicers and struggling to be ok with their ideals on abortion. I've been struggling with the same thing and I have found myself feeling some hatred toward people I meet on the street, being fairly sure they'd support me if I decided to end my unborn child's life.

I think I've found the mentality I need for serenity and coexistence. It's a religious mindset, mind you, so some of you may not like it and I get that. I just wanted to share it in case somebody else could use it since it was shared with me at church. I feel like the more people can think of life this way, the less anger they can breed in themselves. 

Life is temporary and our goal is meant to be as close to God as possible. No one is closer to Him than an unborn child who can't make decisions or even control their own body. We know for certain that aborted children are in a better place without pain or suffering. But the people who killed them aren't. They're still here, with the consequences of their choices and the pain of everyday life. They still have to try to be close to God just like the rest of us. Instead of praying for those unborn children who have died who's souls are already cared for and loved, let's pray for the end of the killings and for the souls of everyone involved. Because they've already had the opportunity (as we all have) to fall away from God. Pray that they find peace. Pray that we don't look down on them since the world has lied to them and they do not see the wrong in what they do.

I know people will disagree with this. This is not meant to judge, only to lift the hearts of prolifers who have lost hope in the people around them.",t2_8qmmsp91,1631489274,prolife

I’m sick of victims being used as pawns,"Tw: Rape

I know my family means no harm but every time we debate about abortion, they bring up rape victims. What they don’t know is I’ve been raped myself (yes, it was by another female so I couldn’t have gotten pregnant but that’s not the point) and I can never bring myself to tell them. It makes me feel like my trauma is being used as a political pawn and I’m tired of it. I understand they think they’re helping victims by using that as an argument but they aren’t. I wish I could tell them what happened to me so they would get why I don’t like rape being brought up in the debate as an argument but I just can’t. It would destroy them. Plus, it’s less than 1 percent of abortions. 

There’s two types of people who use this argument:

1. Those who think that they’re helping (such as my family) 

2. Those who use it to guilt trip us and don’t actually care 

But either way, I’m sick of my trauma being used in politics. We aren’t pawns. We are people trying to heal and I wish people would get that through their heads. Vent over now. Thanks for reading.",t2_247dogos,1631459246,prolife

If yes, you would agree that murdering* any form of life should be treated equally?

If so, which life forms? What circumstances?

Inconsistancies,"Not sure if this is just a vent or if the flair is appropriate,maybe both......Thought I'd run by a few logic fallacies that i,and I'm sure many of you hear time and time again...fallacies that are just intellectually lazy attempts to avoid having to consistantly stick to a claim or argument.


""Its up to the mother to determine whether or not what she's carrying is a valid life...YOU cant make that choice"" ...almost always says this despite insisting that it's not a human life

""Its my right to choose,I should be allowed to abort weather I have a reason or not..and the father has no say""  and once its done for convenience,if guilt is felt ""omg why did he do this to me...its somone else's fault I HAD to abort it.""

And my personal favorite...one that REALLY pisses me off and devalues just about everything modern civilization stands for...

""Well,morality is just subjective to different poeple you can't impose your moral ideals over mine..its WRONG (god the irony is just outstanding)""

Then I guess there is no universal standard that we can hold against the rapist who hurt an innocent child...
its just our interpretation that the robber that stole from a bank and killed 10 poeple did something evil. 

The day society as a whole throws out morality from how it governs and holds itself accountable will be the day it comes crashing down..

If we let this argument slide with abortion,it won't be long before poeple try applying it to infants.

Would you support a government income for mothers/single mothers?,"Hey do you believe there's any incentive in the system we live under for women to carry a pregnancy through full-term? Clearly that's not the case

I'm not like most idiot pro-choicers that like to play defense 100% to your arguments ""it's just a clump of cells"" Ok let's say it's a living human being and that I believe that life begins at  conception. How do you ensure that this baby has a decent life once it's born?

I believe abortion is mostly a symptom of conditions that are outside of the woman's control. And in the overwhelming majority of cases women are scared of pregnacies because they can't afford it, because for a lot of women, having a baby means the end of the little financial freedom they may have but the big irony is that the politicians that want to criminalize abortion are the ones advocating for a smaller welfare state.

So would you agree to have an income for single mothers (and mothers in general) to be full-time mothers.

New rules have been added and upcoming rule changes,"Due to the explosion of new member we decided to add some more rules to the sub. Let's not beat around the bush here they are.

# No Badges of Honor

 

* No post solely dedicated to telling us you were banned from any sub is allowed. We get it Reddit is unfair.

&amp;#8203;

    We already decided to ban this long ago but it was never made into an official rule. No more post about being banned from a subreddit for our views. 

# No off topic discussions

 

* All conversation has to be based or related to abortions, pregnancy, adoptions, foster care, children, and so on. The moderators have the final say on what is or is not off topic.
* We have weekly chats dedicated for off topic discussions, so have those conversations there.

&amp;#8203;

    You guys generally don't have any problems with this rule however sometimes a conversation can get way off track. 

# No pictures or videos of the aborted

&amp;#x200B;

* We cannot allow these pictures/videos on our sub any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

    Too many people have been caught posting animal embryos and trying to use them as ""got ya"" post. Personally I don't know what the point is behind that but nevertheless we will not be allowing these anymore. If you really want to see that stuff look it up on Duckduckgo.

These rules have been added to our list. We still need to update old reddit's list since they are not in sync with new reddit and the wiki but they do exist. Lastly this is the part that you are going to really love or really hate Rule Number 1 is getting revised.

# You must support your claims

Things that need to be cited include:

* Statistics  
* Case studies.  
* Specific claim that could be challenged or easily disputed such as "" London is the foggiest city in the world""
* Specific claims that is not common knowledge

Things that don't need to be cited include:

* Opinions
* Common knowledge such as ""the sky is blue""

Rule of thumb: A claim is to assert something is true. If what you're asserting is true but is not comment knowledge you must cite your sources with a link to where you're getting your information from.

Bad Sources: If your source does not support your claim, is not a credible source, and or is a blog that does not cite their sources then you're still in violation of this rule.

What to expect if you violate this rule: You will be asked by a mod to provide a source, if you cannot your comment will be removed. If you persist to make the same claim you will be banned. Yes even if you posted your citation before on a previous thread if you're making the same claim on another post you still have to give a source. 

    We are cracking down on misinformation a little harder. Well we barely even enforced this rule in the past. We want our users to also start developing habits that will make them more persuasive in the long run. This also allows users to share important information with each other.

My thoughts on pro-life-pro-choice debates:,"We can all agree around the world with our different ideologies and faiths that the life of an innocent human being is the most sacred thing in the world. The question is; what is a “human being”?  
How can we scientifically and philosophically identify such an important term.  
Many religions answer that question, so there’s no problem for Muslims and most Christians and Jews. However, for atheists’ moral reasoning is hard (we all know why, let’s not fight over it).  
How can we have a philosophical and scientific secular argument that identifies when is a human a human?  
For example, one of the pro-lifers I met was saying that a human isn’t truly a human if they haven’t yet experienced life as we see it. Thinking about that lately made me reach a logical conclusion of that philosophy that justifies post-pregnancy abortion…  

We are all here because we don’t want babies to get killed, but if we can’t PROVE they are actually babies, how can we criminalise abortion around the world as an inherently barbaric operation?",t2_au4etttm,1631394918,prolife

The church of satan has made it a simpler choice to be pro-life,"Whether the mother realizes it or not, abortion has always been child sacrifice, a form of satan worship. 

It's surprising how readily the satanic church acknowledges it, and how fervently they are trying to protect the rite, including discouraging counseling and ultrasound. They must be desperate, and that should encourage us. 

In a way, this public declaration by the church of satan is a gift. They've made it clear that opposing abortion means we're on God's side. Most of us have always known that, but it's opening the eyes of many who have tried to remain neutral. Pray more, speak out more, fight for stronger restrictions.

1-You can cut flowers on your tree, so bigger and sweeter apples can grow.
2-You can keep all the flowers and have as many seeds as possible.

  Now, there's no way we can agree on anything, but you guys understand why it's important to have both options available? It's admirable to fight for what you believe is moral, but by doing so you prevent young couples of getting ready to build a family.

So, i'd argue banning abortions actually ruins more families than it saves.

It's not about the number of kids,"Alright, pro-lifers think foetus are as alive as any other human, while pro-choicers think the bean sized bit of flesh isn't capable of self awarness or basic cerebral functions yet. Either way, life is a miracle and shouldn't be wasted. 

That translates in 2 approaches:
1-You can cut flowers on your tree, so bigger and sweeter apples can grow.
2-You can keep all the flowers and have as many seeds as possible.

  Now, there's no way we can agree on anything, but you guys understand why it's important to have both options available? It's admirable to fight for what you believe is moral, but by doing so you prevent young couples of getting ready to build a family.

Let's settle this.,"What's up pro-lifers. I became pro-life two years ago and have some key points I've used to debate this topic in a foolproof way. I sure do get tired of seeing the propaganda and talking points from the left, so I'll go ahead and settle this right now for anyone who's a lil' confused. However, this isn't me hating on pro-choice individuals as I myself used to be one. 

1. No, Emily. Biologically speaking, dumbing a human zygote down to being a ""clump of cells"" up until it's convenient enough to call it a fetus way down the line is straight up not a good argument. Why, you might ask? Well, from the moment of conception, that zygote quickly becomes a fetus after a few short weeks, and has a unique set of DNA separate from the mother. A unique genetic code that determines every characteristic about this future unborn child. When most women find out they're pregnant, often times a heartbeat has started to form as well as major organs. 

2. ""You just want to control women"". Uh, let's break this down. Control what exactly? The outcome of the fetus' life? ""Forcing"" women to give birth is not an accurate statement to make, as 98.5% of the time, statistically speaking, the woman chose to have sex. How about we focus on educating our youth on the consequences of sex, the reality of abortion, and the ""glorious"" hookup culture? Would this change the outcome?

3. ""It's not sentient"". Neither are full grown adults in a coma, under general anesthesia, or are, well, asleep. ""They have the potential to become sentient"" So does a fetus. Anytime we start drawing lines as to when abortion is ok and when it isn't, the same line can be drawn to someone who's an adult. 

4. ""Separation of church and state"". LOL. Complete misuse of that definition and context, 1, and 2, abortion is often times a secular argument as many non-religious people consider themselves pro life. Christians in particular, believe that objective truth exists and that morals are defined by God. ""You shall not murder"". Let's not pretend like the satanic temple didn't just endorse abortion entirely. 

5. ""Let's focus on the mother, kids in foster care, etc"" OR ""You aren't pro life if you support ____ or don't support ____"". 
The definition of being pro-life is to oppose the legalization of abortion due to it being quite literally a form of premeditated murder. To be clear, I don't believe jailing mothers is effective(you can disagree) but abortion doctors, absolutely. You can want to fix the U.S. foster care and adoption system and still believe abortion is morally evil. It's not one or the other and to believe that ending a life before they get the chance to live and eventually improve their circumstances is wrong. 

People that are pro choice typically* (minus the teenage girls leaving comments about wanting to eat a baby, someone come get their kid, please) are well-intentioned, knowledgeable, and want to help. However, we've made it acceptable to act and vote based on emotion, fear and preconceived notions, and that is not acceptable.

I mean aside from the obvious help it gives to premature born infants or pregnancy complications...

In my experiance fear of carrying and childbirth itself is often one of the biggest motivator for voluntary abortion...if this could be perfected and traded for abortion it would make the argument easier to ban abortion.

If Woman could end thier pregnancy,and the child would be unharmed. That would strike the biggest blow possible to abortion...the desire to have one to begin with.

Yes I know that it sounds very irresponsible and unrealistic and can be considered caving to pro choice desire....but the lives of all involved (including the child) is the greatest priority no?

My opinion on abortions,"The scientific world lacks a consensus on what a life is, and therefore i am on the fence about when a human fetus is a life. But i do think that women should have access to abortions until about 12-18 weeks into the pregnancy unless there are medical reasons later than that like abnormalities with the fetus or that the pregnancy is a threat to the Mother. And i think the most effective method of preventing unwanted pregnancies is acces to better birth control. I also think that access to abortions is positive for the public health

While it's true that we often use emotions in our arguments, we mostly just state facts and show people the truth. Meanwhile, we've got the pro-choicers basically putting on a play in the middle of the street. If I didn't know any better, I'd say a lot of them have some sort of weird fetish for the depiction of women in The Handmaid's Tale, seeing as they seem to love wearing those outfits.

Pro Life can also have its negatives just as much as pro choice. What’s your thoughts on this? ⬇️,"Let’s just say a woman who gets raped decides to give her unwanted baby up for adoption. 

That baby then goes to an adoption program or agency and has to go through a really difficult childhood and possibly a really stressful life as a teenager. 

Some adoption agencies are HELL ON EARTH and are ruining the lives of adopted children into adult hood. 

It’s even worst if child never gets adopted. 

Some adoption agency’s treat baby’s and children’s like sh**! Not all, but some of them do.

I have a friend who grew up in the adoption system and he says sometimes things can be bad. Like really bad!

Fast forward! Now that child is an adult and has to live with the fact that their parents or mother never wanted them. That HURTS to think about that. 

My point is, everyone always talks about pro life, but never thinks about what that child may endure as a result.

With that out of the way, I'll get us started!

&amp;#x200B;

**-Rape-**

**PC Argument:** A woman should not have to care for the child of a rapist, not even to the point of delivery!

**Analogy 1:**  Should the wife of an abusive man be able to stab their 1 month old child to death because she hates the man without any moral or legal repercussions?

**Analogy 2:**  If a man beats his his wife and their child, and both will be recovering for 9 months, and the mother will be able to do virtually all her usual tasks in spite of her injuries they will just take a long time to heal and will cause some mild to moderate discomfort, but the child is on life support and will need constant care for 9 months after which the child is expected to make a full recovery. The hospital will take care of all the child’s physical needs for those 9 months for $2000 which the mother can pay over time, or if she has insurance the insurance will cover all the expenses. Now the mother hates the child because it’s the child of the man who beat her, can she opt to take the child off of life support knowing that the child will almost certainly make a full recovery in 9 months and have no moral or legal repercussions?",t2_x08vj,1631295936,prolife

- Not being able to have the surgery because you are under a certain age (but still over 18, a legal adult)
- Not having kids already (most of the time surgery is denied if you don't already have kids)
- Surgery is denied because the doctor assumes that you will change your mind. I know some doctors say this to protect themselves from being sued.

An abortion pills story from my local subreddit,"&gt; Warning: Graphic Read

&gt; So happy to see this flyer, but I'm also going to share my experience for anyone who has never experienced the abortion pill. As well, not saying this is the same for all who ingest. Only my own experience.

&gt; I am 100% pro-choice and will advocate for all measures needed.

...

&gt; 14 hours of the worst pain and agony I've ever felt. It was worse than my experience with child birth.

...

&gt; After 14 hours I ""passed the pregnancy"". They don't tell you you may see ""the pregnancy"" in the toilet. I did. It was about 2 inches. It had arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes, and a brain. And a heart. It was translucent skinned curled up like a shrimp and you could see all the development through that skin. I fucking lost my shit. I broke down at the toilet and sobbed.

&gt; The physical pain stopped immediately after the ""passing"". But Jesus Christ- they don't prepare you for that when they prescribe that pill.

&gt; The only reason I am sharing this, which I've only shared with my partner and best friends, is because I would NEVER want any woman to experience this without knowing what may occur.

&gt; Again, I fully support the right to chose, but if needed, I highly recommend not having this medication at 12 weeks along if there are other options.

Does anyone else resent the fact the the modern pro-life movement has become monolithically associated with Protestant religious fundamentalism?,"The roots of the pro-life movement are distorted depending on which account you read. As far as I can tell, the original pro-life movement was largely based on Catholic principles, constant life ethic, New Deal Programs and anti-war activism for many people. I think sticking to the constant life ethic is not only a more correct approach but also a more compassionate and understanding view of life itself. Being more compassionate to immigrants fleeing harm and religious bigotry have not become associated with us, and in many instances it is correct. The Moral Majority and these initiatives were a mistake to begin with, I think, because we gave the view that only overtly evangelical people are the only ones who care about life, alienating those who agreed on abortion, but felt like outsider on everything else.

Genuine question from a pro-choicer: WHY do you feel like you have a right to life?,"This is a real question that I truly want to understand. I have read the policies and understand that there is moderator discretion for these types of questions. This will probably be deleted, but if not, here is my promise to try and gain moderator acceptance - I will not respond to any answers in this post in any way, or repost, or take any other type of action. I will simply read what responders write, and learn. 

More background about my question:

1. I am probably a fairly moderate pro-choicer compared to others - for example, I think that a fetus is a human life, and I think that abortion is ending a human life. I just think abortion should still be legal. 

2. The reason I think it should be legal is that I* myself would not want to be here if my mother did not want to grow and birth me.* I feel no right to exist if she does not want to do that.  If I imagine my mother found herself pregnant, and the law stepped in to force her to grow and birth me, that makes me sick. I would never want that.

So my question is - WHY do you feel a right to exist of your mother does not want to grow and birth you? Are you actually saying that you would want the law to force her to grow and birth you?

I know that sounds like a challenge, but like I said, I am willing to listen, and I won't respond. I will think about what you write.",t2_4aswbk0n,1631241902,prolife

Bad at titles,"First i would like to point out any potential bias i might have: I am a 15 year old left leaning LGBT+ person who doesnt personally know any prolife people. 

 As someone who is pro choice i get where you are coming from, i really do. But i feel on both sides many arguments are being misrepresented and not enough research is being done.

First of all: You cant generalize all of the people having abortions as people having unsafe sex, Rape happens, Contraceptives failing happens, Condoms failing happens. If a student in college or anyone not making a significant amount of money having a child would be financially devestating, Pregnancy is incredibly dangerous to people aswell and while abortions can also be dangerous the technology improves. Also just like with how legalizing weed would make it more controlled illegalizing abortions would make illegal abortions incredibly common and i dont think i need to explain why that is dangerous.

You call abortion murder but i dont think you realize how comfortable you are with murder (bad wording i know never been a great writer) From the research ive done a 2 year old baby is about as smart as a housecat, Texas's recent limit on abortions puts the limit at 6 weeks into pregnancy and (honestly just guessing here) i would say that a child at under 3 months (where i would personally put the limit although thats stretching it a bit) is significantly less inteligent than a mosquito which im sure most of you are just fine with killing. The argument that it would grow into a human is... hard to argue with as while you are not wrong having to deal with a kid you dont want for 19+ years isnt really something anyone wants to do and especially because chances are that kid wont do anything with their life.

Adoption and foster care isnt reliable enough and on average people who went through those programs are a lot more likely to have mental health issues. you can show stories about children born from rape or a person that went through foster care being happy but those are the stories that get shown not the ones that are common and dont talk about the parents at all.

And as a little side note some of you are calling us evil and i just think that is baseless and a complete non-starter. I have also seen the term ""pro choicer"" and along with ""pro lifer"" i just dont want to see those terms as it puts us on the same level as flat earthers and im sure you dont think that.

Extremely tired of pro choice argument surrounding adoption and social care,"I see so many pro choicers giving the perceived “gotcha” of “if you’re pro life, why aren’t you ADOPTING? why aren’t you HELPING PEOPLE?” 

This irritates me on multiple levels. First, the United States has no shortage of loving families who want to adopt infants. The numbers about the thousands of children in the foster care system are primarily older children and large family groups. In that case, the goal is usually not adoption — it’s to reunite them with biological family members when they are able to take care of them. 

Second, most prolife people are already doing the things mentioned. Prolife and Christian aren’t the same in all circumstances, but Christians adopt at twice the rate of the general population and the organization Catholic Charities is the second largest social safety net in the United States (only behind Social Security)

I shouldn’t be surprised that this poor argument is being parroted but I’m so tired of it.",t2_af7jxa8w,1631220823,prolife

Abortion Is A Hate Crime. (And Pro-Choice Speech is Hate Speech.),"This should be obvious if you've thought about it. Just replace ""fetus"" with ""black"" or ""Jew"" or some other persecuted group.

If you say it's okay to kill black people because they're not actually ""people,"" that would be hate speech. And if you actually kill one because I find their existence inconvenient, (and because their skin color makes them ""not a person"" in your view), that would still be a hate crime.

Call it what it is; Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or—in the case of abortion—age, is no different from any other bigotry.

(Note: Saying ""But I don't *hate* the unborn"" is no defense. If you kill a black guy because he's black, and claim don't ""hate"" him because you don't even think he's a real human being in the first place, that's still considered a hate crime regardless. Simply *not thinking he's a human or a person* makes it a hate crime.)",t2_dd0tt,1631215428,prolife

What’s y’all’s definition of personhood?,"I see a lot of prolifers here and on other platforms say that a person is a human being and while I agree that being a human being is sufficient for being a person, it is not a pre-requisite.  I define personhood the same way as the medieval philosopher Boethius who essentially said a person is an individual of a rational substance.  Or simply that a person is any individual belonging to a species of a rational nature and who has a secondary order capacity to develop rational thought or a primary capacity to develop rational thought.  What this would mean, is that ZEF are persons due to their secondary order, people in comas or who have severe developmental issues that limit their rational thought are still persons due to their secondary capacity, and even non-human beings can be persons.  What I mean by non-human beings are for example aliens who have a rational nature and, if you’re Christian, angels and God (though he’s three persons in one being).

Serious Question for Pro Lifers,"Have a question. If this is the wrong place, please let me know. Not intending to be disrespectful to anyone. While I am pro choice, my sister is pro life and I totally respect her views while she respects mine. But I cannot figure out the endgame if I don't ask the questions. So, if we are going to call it at 6 weeks that a heartbeat means that a fetus is considered a ""baby"" even though it is not viable, I assume this means it has all rights that all people have under the constitution, correct? If that is correct, doesn't that start taking us down a slippery slope? Again, no disrespect, just asking. Whose moral compass decides what rights that child has? Does the mother choose? What if the mother wants to smoke or even drive? What if someone believes that driving while pregnant is child endangerment? Not saying will happen today or tomorrow, but who know what will happen 10 years down the line. Does unborn child's rights trump mother's rights or vice versa? There are abortion bounties in Texas. Will there someday be bounties on pregnant women if you see them involved in ""risky behavior"".  Women in El Salvador are being sent to prison for decades even for miscarriages if an abortion is even suspected.

If pro choice was correct, it does not matter to the other side because their argument does not hinge on it either.

On morality and pro-abortion identiti,"I've recently ran into two arguments being used for abortion and I'm curious how often other pro lifers run into them,and how to best respond to it.

1. Poeple who say that being pro-life on moral grounds is irrelivent due to the presumption that morality is supposedly subjective

2. Poeple who literally identify as ""pro abortion"" and say abortion should be encouraged to always be favored over pregnancy based on the presumed belief that pregnancy is inherently life threatening

I mean is it just me,am I insane to be completely dumbfounded by these fallacies?",t2_79d98ijk,1631167841,prolife
The one pro-life argument I can’t seem to find,"I never understood the pro-life mindset, in fact, when I was younger (10 and below) I didn’t know anti-abortion was even a thing. In an attempt to broaden my mental horizons I spent lots of time on this subreddit, I looked up articles, personal stories, and statistics of pregnant women debating on abortion. I can confidently say I understand most pro-life sentiment now; (rape &lt; 1% of abortion cases, children shouldn’t pay for the father’s crimes, marginal cases shouldn’t define an entire system). Most of my questions have been answered and whether I agree or not, I am thankful.

However, there’s one question that the pro-lifers on this subreddit seem to dance around, either knowingly because it’s difficult to answer or they simply don’t think about that factor. 

Pregnancy is extremely painful. An EXTENSIVE list of complications can arise solely from pregnancy such as severe nausea, vomiting, iron-deficiency anemia, NUMEROUS infections, depression, and many many more. And that's not even mentioning how women have to push a watermelon sized baby out of a quarter sized whole which many times tear the flesh. Having children is a beautiful thing, many women will go through this pain happily for children; and of course pregnancy doesn't equate to suffering.

I have many reasons to be pro-choice, the biggest one is that I'm not a woman so I feel uncomfortable talking about this subject and even more uncomfortable telling women what to do with their bodies (I know pro-lifers think of this topic as more of the baby's body than the mother's). The second biggest reason is, for the women who do not choose to get pregnant (but became so anyway) why should they have to put themselves through all that pain when they don't want a child?",t2_47p61glj,1631167762,prolife

Question about consent to fornication in the law,"Though I lean somewhat pro-choice, I find myself strongly supportive of making consent to fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense. This probably stems from my experience as a male who:

1. accepts that human life starts at conception,

2. has experienced female sexual abuse,

3. recognises that rape and sexual assault are extremely difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt,

4. recognises that consent to fornication would be at least somewhat easier to prove than rape or sexual assault,

5. recognises that the easier provability of consent to fornication would more effectively deter rape and sexual assault, and

6. recognises the moral necessity for legislators to make a reasonable effort to effectively deter conception through rape or sexual assault.

With the above in mind, I find it odd that there is no discussion among pro-life advocates to legislate more effective deterrents against rape and sexual assault.

Even though I lean somewhat pro-choice, I probably would vote for a pro-life candidate with little hesitation if that candidate promised to make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense. The reason for this is that I have difficulty accepting a ban on abortion without first adequately deterring rape and sexual assault.

Even if fornication did become an offense, I probably would still lean somewhat pro-choice; but I can say that the absence of such a law makes me decidedly pro-choice.

Why don't pro-life activists reach out to pro-choice-leaning voters who still believe that human life starts at conception and so believe in the necessity to legislate a more effective deterrent against coerced sex?",t2_8md27ufj,1631136601,prolife

"In 2019, 34% of pregnancies in the City of Detroit ended in abortion, whilst 52% ended in live births and 14% in miscarriages.","This rate is astronomically high and one of the highest in the nation. Yet, pro-choice commentators paint the statistic as a ""tragedy"" in the Daily Beast:  [31% of Detroit Pregnancies Aborted (thedailybeast.com)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/05/23/31-of-detroit-pregnancies-aborted) and the Huffington Post acknowledges the issue: [Nearly A Third Of Detroit Pregnancies End In Abortion | HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/detroit-abortion-rate_n_5381241). If pro-choice advocates are alleging that high abortion rates are a problem, why don't they acknowledge that having an abortion has not produced a fruitful solution, as the process never ends. Since the time of the Daily Beast articles' writing of reference (2012), the percentage of pregnancies that have ended in abortion has risen a further 3% (circa 2019). Further, poverty is not a direct link as they might allege. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the City of Detroit's poverty rate (2012 1-Year Community Survey Estimates) put the citywide poverty rate at 42.3% (with the 90% C.I. placed at +/- 1.6%), whilst according to the 2019 1-Year Community Survey Estimate, the citywide poverty rate had fallen to 30.6% (with the 90% C.I. placed at +/- 1.9%). Conclusively, the poverty rate fell approximately 11.7% (+/- 1.6-1.9%).

"“If you had to decide between saving a baby and 1000 fertilized fetuses, who would you save.”","Ladies and gents, this is what we call a straw man and I hope to explain why. 

The argument is wether an unborn fetus is a living person, or as the opposition would say “clump of cells”. 

Asking if you’d save something actually doesn’t prove anything at all except that the person who just said it is very bad faith. The reason why is that if I’m saying it’s a living thing then regardless of what decision I make its still supportive of a fetus being a living person. It’s like asking if I’d save my mom or dad, the argument serves no purpose other than arguing a useless point. If I say the toddler it’s fine because I’d saved a living thing and if I save the fertilized fetuses then again good because I saved living thing (that aren’t born yet but nonetheless.)

Now there’s also the topic of abortion itself, the situation is in no way comparable, the choice in abortion is giving birth to a child or murdering a child. Both choices are not about saving lives, only one is.",t2_2xz1drns,1631123887,prolife

Thoughts on the Texas Heartbeat Act,"All the pearl-clutching over the new Texas Heartbeat Law \*would\* be well-justified ***\*except\* for two (2) things***:  The unborn baby is fully human and has a full right to life.  You may be anti-science about that, and that's your problem, but the LOGIC of the situation is clear: GIVEN the scientific fact that an unborn baby is fully human and GIVEN the moral fact that every human individual has an inherent right to life, the bill is something to rejoice about.  So if you want to act all scandalized and whatnot, then EITHER you are anti-science and are blind to the reality of pre-born life OR you think only \*some\* lives are worth protecting (or maybe both).   Social justice that doesn't extend to the most helpless and vulnerable members of the human community is pretty screwed up.   (Actually, there is a third option: You are engaged in systematic double-think, where you acknowledge those two facts, yet isolate them from everything else you think.)

Debate the \*premises\* if you deny the \*conclusion\*.  That's Logic 101 (literally).  But the degree of misrepresentation of what the bill actually says, what its supporters believe, and how it relates to other issues is off the charts off the mark.  Focus, people, focus...

Every \*single\* thing that is said against this that \*isn't\* an argument that babies aren't human individuals or that some human individuals don't have a right to life is purely a distraction.  If you've read this far and still can't stay on topic, my only response is going to be ""FOCUS.""",t2_13kzqx,1631119128,prolife

"Can you guys answer me, why do being a human matter when it come to why a women can't have an abortion ?","So I am pro chocie and I always find it dumb when people throw out 'because a fetus is a human' argument to why we can't have abortion. I live in america and at least here in america, we are fine with killing another human, the death penalty, police shooting, cooperation using human, self defense, protect your castle, the military. 

is it just me or dose it seem that we don't care if another human dies, I mean look at covid we can't even agree on that,

from my point of view if I was a fetus in my mother womb, most of you guys would be fighting to make sure she wouldn't abort me, you all would probably be saying that I am a precious gift from god or how how my mother would be killing a human being or something like that  but if I was to go out and buy a gun and shot up a mall and kill at least 6 people I am sure at least some of you pro lifers would call me a monster and probably advocate for me to get the death penalty. 

ever since covid started there have been protest all over the country for different reason a few hundreds people at least, from my point of view I can buy a car and drive right into those people killing a few and crippling more. if I was to do that I am sure at least half the country would want me dead. 

the fact that a lot of pro lifer have to specify by saying that the mother is killing an INNOCENT human being pretty much tells me that even those people are more ok with certain human being killed. if someone was to abort Ted Bundy then at least 30 people would most likely still be alive, giving up that 1 human life would had save 30 human life at least

I wanted you all to know where I stand on the topic of abortion. 

I am absolutely against it.

Whether you believe it or not, when you consent to an abortion you are consenting to the killing of your pre-born baby. 

There is a consensus in the field of biology that human life begins at conception: 

https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html

https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/wdhbb.html

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703

Human beings are constantly changing and developing throughout their lives. a human in the womb undergoes certain stages of life) zygote, embryoand blastocyst.) just like a human outside of the womb undergoes different stages (infant, toddler, child, teenager, adult, elderly etc) 

Not one human is less worthy of life than another judging only by their current stage of development. 

A human being is not less worthy of life because of their financial stability, their mental capacity, the parents they were born to, their outward appearance. 

In fact. 

There is absolutely no reason a person should be stripped of their right to life.

Here is a question I hear pro-choice individuals asking pro-life individuals often

Should a woman who was a victim of rape carry her baby until birth? Yes. A child is mot worthy of death for the crime of their parent. 

If you believe a baby in the womb conceived by rape should be put to death then I’d like to know if you believe a newborn, a two year old, a five year old, or a ten year old should be put to death if the mother decides they no longer want to care for their child due to the trauma their “biological father” caused her. 

If the answer is no, why not?  If the reason for killing the baby is solely based on the fact that the mother was a victim of rape then the age of the baby shouldn’t matter. 

If the age of the baby matters, and your reasoning is that you don’t believe a pre-born baby is as worthy of life as a born baby then it’s irrelevant whether the mother was raped. 

Because to you anybody should be able to kill a pre-born baby. Because to you it isn’t a baby. 

You’re using rape as leverage for an irrelevant argument. 

If you believe that an abortion is only appropriately performed when the mother was a victim of rape then you must believe that a baby conceived of rape is less worthy of life than one who wasn’t. 

Obviously, I disagree. 

I could very seriously go on and on regarding this topic. Probably for ages. I am VERY PASSIONATE about advocating for the lives of babies. But finally I’d like to share my story again about our son, Eden.

Eden was 21 weeks in my womb when his trisomy was confirmed. I was immediately pushed toward having an abortion by doctors I had never met before. I was told he would not make it to term anyway and that if he did, his life would be painful and full of suffering. 

That was OUT OF THE QUESTION for both keiffer and I. We carried that sweet boy until term, and held him in our arms for three whole days. He slept in our arms, and gave us sleepy smiles, and cooed, and knew what a life full of love was like. He did not suffer. He was beautiful and aware and had he lived another hundred years he would not have known a day without the love of his family. 

He was our baby boy. 

And for some baby boys their final moments are full of the pain of being ripped apart in the womb, never meeting their mom. Never taking that first breath. Never feeling a warm hug. Never giving a genuine smile. Never laughing. Never taking their first steps. Never making a friend. Never going to school. Never falling in love. Never having their own kids.

When you abort a baby you are not just “evacuating your womb” you are destroying a child’s chance at life. You are taking away every beautiful thing they would have experienced had they grown up. 

That is the only life that they had, and you ended it before they even got to see the light of the sun. They will never get to live again.

I’m happy to discuss this further (not to have an argument) with anyone who disagrees.”",t2_8yfhx89p,1631050197,prolife

Why is the fetus more valuable than the woman?,"Hi!

I identify as someone in the middle in the whole Pro Life vs Choice debate. I’m not 100% on either side 

I say that because I can understand both sides of the argument and even have my own ideas on what should and shouldn’t be allowed in abortion (For me, I believe that abortion in the 3rd trimester should be allowed, but disagree that abortion should be banned out right)

I’ve noticed that ProChoice tends to value the woman more while ProLife tends to value the fetus more

I want to ask why this is the case. There is no denying that the fetus is definitely a form of human life, but I can’t compare that fetus to an actual 1 month old infant or see why a fetus is more valued than the mother. Especially when considering that pregnancy is a serious thing and not something someone just forgets about after it happens. When I see a woman vs a few weeks old fetus, I see it as a form of human life but not one that overrides a person who is already here 

However, I also can’t see why, in most cases, a woman would need to wait 6 months for an abortion (at least in the US idk about other countries) unless her period is highly irregular (which I understand) and her body does not differ much from pregnancy in terms of shape.


Personally, I feel that the woman has higher priority over the fetus, but a 6 month fetus would have higher priority but that’s not including possible health complications and what not

So that leads me to ask, for the ProLife crowd, why is the fetus more valuable than the woman?

I do not want to argue, I want a civil talk. If you’re going to insult me then please do not respond.",t2_ee695ixm,1631044682,prolife

Another Refutation.,"If an outcome was preceded by a person willfully choosing to take an action which resulted in the outcome, the person acknowledged the risks and/or benefits, as nature has taught us itself. The principle, is quite clear to most people when applied to the idea of a drunk driver. The driver acknowledged and consented to the possible outcomes they had at the outset of consuming a beverage which had the potential to limit the person's sobriety. The subsequent outcomes were acknowledged, knowingly or not. The responsibility for the accident is hereby imparted upon the individual that chose this course of action, due to their unbounded ability to choose an action which inevitably had positive and negative possible outcomes. It is relevant to apply the idea to other areas of life in terms of decisions, ""great power has great responsibility."" It is conclusive that, applying the same principle, we see that it is necessary to be aware of as many outcomes as possible, before making a decision, particularly when the potential outcomes involve and/or pose a threat to other people.",t2_2b27n74u,1631040311,prolife

A possible compromise to pro-choice and pro-birth?,"Disclaimer: I say pro-birth instead of pro-life because pro-choice is an umbrella term that includes people who would AND wouldn’t get abortions since the whole meaning is *to have the choice wether to abort or not*

I am a pro-choice woman who believes a woman’s bodily autonomy comes first, and though I don’t really see a clump of cells as “life” I can sympathize with the other side for wanting to give a fetus the chance to live (though I also feel like we shouldn’t be making decisions on behalf of a fetus if that fetus was to one day regret being born, but besides the point) 

The technological advances we have made in this day and age has given us the miraculous power of saving organic beings, and slowing, our technology has been used to incubate premature babies, younger and younger. So with this in mind, can’t both sides of this debate push for funding on advanced fetus incubators so that women who don’t want to carry a baby, can have them removed safely and held in an “artificial womb”, and open for adoption?

Now to get some stuff out of the way, first, I hate the idea of having to put kids into the foster systems and would much rather a fetus is aborted than cause chaos to its life before it’s even born, but with the whole “pro-life” argument only becoming more tense recently I can’t help but want to reach AT LEAST some middle ground before every state in the US starts looking like the hand maids tale.

Response to those who say pro-lifers are hypocrites and don’t care about life,"I have many responses. Here they are in no particular order: 

1. Fine. Let’s assume I’m a hypocrite. That’s not a defense for your position. Imagine a defendant arguing in trial he should be found not guilty because the jury are hypocrites. 


2. I oppose killing homeless people. Do I give them for or money every time I see them? No. And neither do most pro-choicers.  Just because I don’t actively _support_ them, it does not follow that I should be OK with actively _harming_ them. Imagine someone claiming that you’re a hypocrite for believing it should be illegal to kill homeless people because you walk by them every day and don’t support them. 

3. Most arguments for pro-lifers not caring about life are dubious at best. Especially the often cited “pro-lifers support the death penalty.” 

First, on a side note, the arrogance of this argument is it assumes that the death penalty is inhuman, whereas life in prison is. As far as I’m concerned, I’d choose the death penalty over life in prison. 

Second, and more importantly, it takes some real audacity to compare a fetus to a convicted murderer. 

This notion that supporting the death penalty for those who kill others makes me a hypocrite doesn’t care about a fetus is honestly disgusting.

Keep the government out of religion and win the abortion debate.,"Seriously people we need to keep the abortion debate about secular pluralistic principles based on biological science! We don't want the government weighing in on religious debates and religion has not come to consensus about the abortion debate. But if instead of debating religion we maintain that human rights should be for all humans and rely on biological science to classify all living homo sapiens sapiens as humans then there is no debate. There are almost no biologists out there who wouldn't acknowledge that when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg from that moment forward it is a new human life. So at that point we can move on to the real heart of the matter, under what circumstances does a mother's right to self-defense trump her child's right to life? If we want to love them both we need to acknowledge both of those rights.

A Refutation of a Common Pro-choice Argument.,"I have read through various subreddits, Quora pages and scholarly articles that commonly frame the defense of abortion on the sole idea of bodily autonomy but still argue for limits to abortion in the third-trimester. The main pillars of the argument fall flat. It only stands to reason that if bodily autonomy is the sole tenant of your argument, you must then support abortion for any reason up to the point of birth. If you introduce a second pillar to argue for your idea of limits, coinciding with the initial argument, it becomes muddled on the basis that your second argument cannot withdraw the boundless scope of the first, unless you admit there are bounds within the idea of bodily autonomy, in which case the first pillar still falls on the basis that the unborn child is still inside the body of the pregnant mother until the point of birth.",t2_2b27n74u,1630993743,prolife

I‘m not from the US but I of course still noticed the new texas abortion ban and the meltdown the internet is going through right now.

I also read a lot of times that pro-choicers claim that pro-lifers only want to have control over woman. That that is their driving force. Good old misogyny. I really fail to see how that makes any sense.

I‘m from Germany and here abortion is not as huge as a topic but I guess that the correlations are similiar in the US. We have around 100.000 abortions a year with rape not even making up 1%. The second chunk is medical complications and the big big majority of over 95% comes from simply going to a counceling session in the first 12 weeks of the pragnancy for whatever reason (My guess: I don‘t want to be a mom) and getting it done. 

Most of the pro life folks I ever listened to mainly don‘t see it as acceptable to kill a baby just because of your convenience. We aren‘t forcing those woman to get pragnant. We just want people to take responsebility for their actions.

"I have said something similar on here before, but here is a solution to Abortion: Don't have sex unless you are prepared for the responsibility of a baby","This is not about the 1-3.5% of abortions due to rape/health of the mother. This is the 95+%. Abodtion is about responsibility. Or lack thereof. People today ridicule religious people or people in the past who want celibacy outside of marriage, but what has 60 years of pure sexual freedom accomplished? 60 million dead from abortion, 10s of million dead from AIDS, and numerous other raging STD epidemics. I'll take my abstinence over being involved with that. 

But that aside, you don't *need* sex. You need food, shelter, water, and realistically some education. You can live perfectly well without sex. And if you choose not to, your poor decision shouldn't be taken out on a child.

The question of abortion and animal rights,"This is something I'm genuinely curious about. What is the pro-life stance on animal rights? I'm thinking of farm animals, but vermin and pets as well.

The fact is that the vast majority of arguments from the pro-life community are based around the fact that a fetus is viable, has a heart, and can feel pain. Why is it not okay to then, say, kill the fetus if it is unwanted, but to kill a mouse in your house with a mousetrap is perfectly fine?

In the same way, how is it acceptable to kill a lamb for its meat? A lamb can feel pain, joy, fear, love for its mother, same as fetus - if not more so since its brain is far more developed than a fetus'.

It seems the only difference between the fetus, who it is cruel and immoral to kill, and the lamb, who it is okay to kill en masse, is that one is human and the other isn't. What grants the human one a greater claim to life than another?

Mind you, one is being killed to spare the mother the pain of carrying it to term, while the other is being killed just because someone wants to eat lamb, a far more frivolous reason. 

I'm not necessarily for or against abortion, I'm just curious what the source of this human exception is.",t2_9eld37aw,1630948757,prolife

How old is abortion.,"Jesus Christ condemned abortion 2000 years ago, but did abortion existed at that time? If yes then how it was performed? When was it invented?",t2_7aiajcxq,1630946195,prolife
Why do pro-lifers prioritize laws that don't actually decrease abortions by a lot?,"So I am prochoice, but I can understand and respect the philosophy of prolife. If you equate abortions to killing children, then I may not agree but I can respect your opinion. 

But what I don't understand is why the prolife movement as a whole pushes for legislation that doesn't actually decrease those ""killings"" as much as the policies pushed for by prochoice advocates. 

For example, there is a lot of debate about whether abortion bans actually decrease them in the long run. When you compare countries with bans vs where it's legal, there isn't much of a difference in rates of abortions. And when I try to find studies where they do reduce them, the most I've ever found is a 25% decrease. 

The things that prochoice people push for though have a way bigger impact. Increasing access to contraceptives alone has resulted in a 72% decrease in abortions, and that's just contraceptives! When you add that to improving the quality of sexual education, abortions fall even more. And the best part is that it doesn't result in anyone being forced to continue a pregnancy or give birth against their will, which is something that is really important to prochoice advocates. It might take a while to explain why, but let's just say for simplicity sake that prochoicers see people being able to say what happens to their bodies as completely sacred, the same way that prolife sees all human life, no matter what form, as sacred. 

So if you are comparing the two: banning abortions vs improving access to birth control and contraceptives, it seems like the second is the best approach. It respects the values of both pro-lifers and prochoicers since it prevents the most abortions from happening, while also preventing lack of autonomy. It's also incredibly fast. You can instantly prevent a huge number of abortions, rather than with a ban where people can go to other states to get them. 

But I still see most prolife advocates pushing for the bans. Even if they also agree with the birth control access, they still prioritize the bans in their voting and policy decisions instead of the approach that would actually have the biggest impact on abortions. 

So I guess my question for ya'll is, why do you push for the solution that prevents less abortions (bans/restrictions) more than you push for the solutions that prevent the most abortions AND respects your fellow Americans' values too? If saving human lives, and as fast as possible, is your main goal, then it doesn't seem like your approach/impact is matching up with your values and goals.",t2_lvrsyqk,1630945577,prolife

Pro-choicer here! Would love to hear your responses to this analogy,"I present this analogy in good faith and I’m here to revise it if needed. Any thoughts are welcome :)

Imagine we lived in a world in which men were predisposed to a condition where if they consumed meat, there was a slight chance that a clone of themselves would begin developing inside their rectum. This condition would give the man Stage 3 prostate cancer for about a year until the clone becomes sentient and exits their rectum. (Obviously, given that the cancer is stage 3, there is a slight chance the man could die at any point without warning). We have a cure for the cancer but the procedure would require inserting a probe that ultimately kills the clone living inside their ass.

Should this cure be banned? Should men have to endure stage 3 cancer in order to save the clone?


SOME ANTICIPATED RESPONSES:  
* **If it were me, I just wouldn’t eat meat** — Sure. For men who don’t want a clone, the responsible decision would just be to become vegetarians. This is obviously a hard sell given all the meat advertisements we see in our daily lives, but it would certainly be the ideal choice to make and one I would recommend. This however doesn’t answer the question of whether the procedure should be banned.  
* **The right to life does not apply to clones** — Why not? The clone would be just as human as anyone else.  
* **”Oh great, another silly analogy…”** — I actually don’t see how one could view this analogy as silly when it is almost perfectly analogous to pregnancy. The man does a voluntary act that naturally results in the creation of a new human, and this has plaguing effects on the man’s body that are potentially fatal, the only solution to this being a procedure that kills the new human. I’m certainly open to hearing what makes this case relevantly different.",t2_38qy6ydl,1630944898,prolife

Why is the pain of the woman ignored so much? Shouldn’t it count in an argument?,"Something I noticed:

A lot of those here on ProLife either don’t mention, ignore, or diminish the pain of the woman

There’s a lot of talk on how the future baby can be adopted, but it still ignores that the woman has to go through 9 months of drastic changes to the body and then painful hours of labor 

Whenever I bring this up and get a response it’s always;

-she’s a woman that’s what her body is meant to do

-the pain will be worth it 

-other women have given birth to multiple kids again and again

-she just take medicine 


But why? One person being able to do something does not mean that another person can easily do the same. Some medicines cannot be taken for certain pregnancies and brushing off the birthing process basically just ignores the woman in pain in favor the fetus


I guess what I’m asking is:

Why is this okay? Why is the pain of the woman (9 months + labor) ignored as if non existent?",t2_e337a8om,1630942518,prolife

Pro-choicers: Go down the list and realize these arguments/wordplays you are attempting do not work.,"Honestly, get it through your skulls every pro-choicer who comes in here:

1) We consider the fetus/whatever you want to call it a child and a human and deserving of human rights. That isn't going to change: Stop trying to change our minds on that reality because it isn't going to change

2) Calling it a fetus doesn't change point 1. It's still a human being deserving of all rights as a human being. We don't care the state of its body.

3) Stop trying to act like calling it a fetus makes your argument air tight. It doesnt. Your argument relies on dehumanizing the person you are trying to kill. That is not a tactic that ever works. 

4) We have no interest in controlling anyone's body: We care about the body of the child. You can have as much sex as you want, we don't give a damn, we care when you decide that it's okay to kill a child for what you did.

5) Calling it a parasite or whatever won't change our mind, and you're barking up the wrong tree with that approach. We see you as an idiot when you call a child a parasite and lacking human empathy which means you lack the ability to argue in favor of your side.

6) There are many pro-life atheists and secularists. These people do not use a single teaching from the Bible or any other religious text to back up their views concerning being pro-life. Telling them that they have religious views because they are pro-life makes you look dumb. 

7) Yes the child/fetus is alive. Why is this a talking point with you people currently? It's the dumbest thing I have honestly ever heard in my life.

8) Yes it's human, again where is this pro-choice talking point coming from that a human being in early stages of development isn't human. It's beyond stupid.

9) Yes the primary purpose of sex is reproduction! The view that the primary purpose of sex isn't reproduction is so stupid it is impossible to find papers on the subject. It has to be born out of some attempt to frustrate pro-lifers because it's such a stupid argument it's like arguing with someone that humans breathe air and then them saying ""Oh well the primary purpose of breathing isn't to live"". Stop with that stupid ""argument"".

10)  Arguing in circles is stupid and annoying. If you are unwilling to admit the child/fetus is human and you just keep saying ""Well it doesn't fit my view of what a human is"" you need to sit down and shut up. No one in the history of the planet has ever been considered a ""good guy"" who decided arbitrarily what is and isn't a human.

These attempts at what you think are arguments are not: Their bad faith arguments that have no backing in your head when you bring them up and you have that smug attitude like you got some kind of gotcha on pro-lifers. None of you have come up with a new, decent argument about why you should be allowed to murder children every time you come breezing in here.

You see the sidebar? Use it before you post from now on. You got a good faith question ask it but when we answer don't try to then tell us we're wrong: We understand our reason, you are asking why and in the end pro-choice simply means pro-death - there has never been a time in human history that the dehumanizing or killing of a certain group of people deemed less than human has been looked back on favorably.",t2_lxmbf,1630939991,prolife
My abortion Story,"This isn't a story about my abortion, it is a story about how my parents did not abort me. 

I was an accident baby. My parents did not care for each other much at the time I was conceived, and they were not married. My conception essentially required that they get married (they were religious also abortion was less accepted at that time). 

Essentially, this went on to develop a very unhappy marriage for the next 15+ years. My parents went on to have three more kids.

My mother was extremely depressed for a long time, on the level of it being abusive indirectly towards her children. It left all of us with irreparable, long lasting, and awful scars. 

A few decades later, after their eventual divorce, I see the harm that this had on me, my siblings, and others involved. My siblings have a host of issues. Myself, I have extreme depression. My sibling's kids have issues stemming from my sibling's issues. Etc.. etc.. these are things that we have to live with. This is the primary reason that I will never have kids. 

All of this could have been prevented if my parents felt like they could have an abortion without being judged. So much pain would have been avoided for so many people, and so many people would have had the chance at happiness if they aborted me and did not feel like they should try and make things work because of some responsibility that did not exist.",t2_8g9lfou4,1630939958,prolife

""There's actually an interesting Biblical break on equating persons with human embryos. The syllogism goes like this, Genesis 9:16 says that those who kill the image of God must themselves be killed. Exodus 21:22, which is in a passage explicitly about what killings are murder and what killings are not murder, says that if a man causes a woman to miscarry, he is not killed, but he has to pay a fine to the woman's family, determined by the court. So, the fetus then does not have the image of God. According to these passages, the image of God, personhood, is obtained at birth. It is a, literally, a birthright.""

How many of you are actually Pro-Life?,"The new Texas Bill is in place but so far I have seen no advancements to make pregnancy easier for women. I had this same argument on Instagram with a Pro—Life Man and it has angered me to the core. 

I proposed everything on this list and he had to argue against it. So if you really want to ban abortion but refuse to introduce any of these things are you really Pro-Life or Forced-Birth. 

* Defund other areas like the Police and increase funding in foster care and advertisement so the government encourages people to adopt. 
* Pass a bill so Doctors cannot refuse women hysterectomies and allow them to be fully accessible.
* Raise minimum wage so the people who most have abortions, lesser income families, can afford a child.
* Reduce the wage gap, because as of right now in the US women earn 82 cents to a man’s dollar. Stop making women dependant on men so they can raise the child on their own without a man’s help.
* Increase funding in charities that provide free housing to pregnant and non-pregnant women seeking shelter from abuse. 
* Right now women in the US only receive 12 weeks of unpaid maternity. Canada provides 15 weeks of paid maternity and the US is the only high-income country that doesn’t support pregnant women financially with federal law. 
* Provide free condoms to those below a certain salary to reduce children born into poverty and encouraging safe sex.
* Either a law that allows lower-income people to access free healthcare, or even better, provide universal healthcare for all. Did you know in the US it costs $5,000-$11,000 to birth a child in hospital. 

Low-income households are the most affected by pregnancy and alongside POC, are the leading factors for abortion. Having a child should be a personal choice, not a lifestyle one. But the US is that twisted, that 43.96 million people in poverty cannot afford a child and they’re the people affected by abortion bans. 

Protest! Protest once, protest twice and protest again. Because the harsh truth is that you cannot ban abortion without introducing these plans. Make pregnancy easier and more people will keep the child. 

Fingers crossed y’all agree or I’m just going to be left gobsmacked. I’ve said what I needed to say.

This would mean no scraping, no dismembering, just taking the fetus out of the woman’s body as it’s her body and the fetus’ body would be intact

Would this be okay? Why or why not? I was thinking about this scenario and it seems that it would be okay as the woman is not “killing” the fetus. The woman has her own body and as she has no ownership over the fetus’ body, then the fetus has no ownership on staying inside the woman’s body

Chicken or the egg,"I would like input on this thought.

I know one of the major things that people get hung up over is the fact that the pre-born reside inside and connected to the mother. Therefore it allows them to wrongly think that it's not an indivudal human being.

My thinking is if you compared human reproduction to chickens it would be much easier for people to realize it's not the case. The fetus is outside of the parent how would they rationalize it's not an individual chicken?

If they concede it's an individual chicken than the only difference with humans is location which imo is the hardest attribute to defend. That location is what makes someone an individual being.",t2_9gfnsllu,1630897513,prolife

Question from an AntiNatalist,"Hey all,

I’d like to have a respectful dialogue with you about the idea that the new Texan law is a “win for the unborn”. 

From where I’m standing, I’m not really seeing how now banning abortions at this level is “saving” anyone, rather than forcing them to be born in, which in some circumstances, frankly suck ass, due to the parent’s inability to adequately take care of the child, and lack of government, private, or familial help and support.

I suppose I could understand it if it was followed up with assistance programs (public, private, or joint venture) but I’m not seeing that. Even more long term, I’m not seeing these same states implement much of any solutions to battle future problems that these children will have to grow up in, such as climate change.

So basically, how is just “being born” here a win, if there’s no structure to ease the unnecessary burdens and trials of the living experience?

Thanks for y’all’s time.",t2_afpmz7aj,1630895076,prolife
Apparently you can't support only child families if you don't believe in abortion,"So I'm an only child and the parent of an only child. I had a bad pregnancy and I won't be able to have a second pregnancy without putting my health and the life of my unborn child at risk so I won't be trying to get pregnant again. There is a podcast called Only You (please don't harass them, just look at their page) that is all about the different circumstances that may lead parents to having only one kid. It's been a great resource to me as I've come to terms with having one less kid than I originally planned as well as the trauma from my high risk pregnancy. The hosts are very left wing Portlanders so I'm not surprised at their pro choice posts and have just rolled my eyes and scrolled on by when they have posted BS that I don't support in the past but...this new post upset me way more.

[Post](https://www.facebook.com/102252488337274/posts/296752168887304/)

The post in question says that you can't support one and done families if you don't believe in abortion. This pissed me off to no end. I was responsible with my sex life. I never had sex without birth control when we weren't trying to get pregnant. I was also diligent about taking the pill when I was on it. I waited to start a family until I was married, in a safe living situation and financially stable. And because I can't handle the idea of a late term miscarriage ( likely with my health issues) I'm doing the responsible thing and getting my tubes tied. I have an only child and I'm totally on board with other people wanting one kid (or even no kids) but why do I have to support murdering an unborn child to support having an only child. 

Furthermore, my parents had an only child without getting an abortion. They had severe fertility problems and got pregnant on an absolute fluke. My mom is also a pro life Catholic so I'm 100 percent positive, I'm not an only child because my mom had an abortion. Once again, my parents felt they were too old to have a second since I was a later in life surprise and my dad was responsible and got snipped. Why do the responsible people have to support the irresponsible people just because they want the same outcomes as us? Don't want kids or more than one kid? Either don't have sex or be extremely consistent with your birth control or get vasectomy / tubal. 

I'm conflicted about whether I'll continue listening. It's the only podcast out there about raising Only Children so I hate to have to pass it by but I literally went from almost supporting them on Patreon to wanting to never listen again because of one post.",t2_bsuby5mk,1630892896,prolife

Abortion is legal. But every single abortion must be recorded, logged. Else jail and big fines and lost medical licence.

All women gets a card. This card contains info (real time electronic database) that she had an abortion or not. 

Private businesses can ask to see this card. They can refuse service to women if they had one abortion. Your boss can check your abortion status online any time and fire you if you had an abortion. 

Additionally, people who work in jobs which involve young children, cannot be held by people who had an abortion. If they killed one who is merely few years younger, they are a danger to these kids either.

Big business can ban people with abortions en masse. Refuse them service, or refuse doing business with them.

People who had abortions are shamed. Called dangerous members of society. Friends cut contact with them, grandmas refuse to let them visit, or the grandma is banned from seeing their grandkids.

Restaurants who are willing to cater to them make a different part for them. The abortion aisle if you will.

Glorification of Abortion and Historical Child Sacrifice.,"This is just a bit of info I thought I'd share after reading about the Canaanites. Thought y'all would find it fascinating. IDK. Sort of an essay I guess. Enjoy!

* Graphic descriptions of child sacrifice will follow

As Choice42 explains it, ""There's nothing new under the sun.""^(1) Child sacrifice has been around for a long time, and despite our nice white, sterile rooms, it's still just about as barbaric as it was thousands of years ago. Let me display an ancient example or two first.

Clay Jones quotes Albright (See original quote source in the linked source) in his article on the Canaanites' depravity:

&gt;Leviticus 18:21 commands, ""Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech."" Molech was a Canaanite underworld deity represented as an upright, bull-headed idol with human body in whose belly a fire was stoked and in whose outstretched arms a child was placed that would be burned to death. It was not just unwanted childred who were sacrificed. Plutarch reports that during the Phoenician (Canaanite) sacrifices, ""the whole area before the statue was filled with a loud noise of flutes and drums so that the cries of the wailing should not reach the ears of the people."" And it was not just infants; children as old as four were sacrificed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kleitarchos says Phoenicians and especially Carthaginians who honoured Kronos, whenever they wished to succeed in any great enterprise, would vow by one of their children if they achieved the things they longed for, to sacrifice him to a god. A bronze image of Kronos was set up among them, stretching out its cupped hands above a bronze cauldron, which would burn the child. As the flame burning the child surrounded the body, the limbs would shrivel up and the mouth would appear to grin as if laughing, until it was shrunk enough to slip into the cauldron.^(2)

Maev Kennedy at The Guardian reports another description.

&gt;The Roman historian Diodorus and other ancient historians gave graphic accounts of Carthaginian child sacrifice: ""There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus, extending its hands, palms up and sloping towards the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.""^(3)

But while that same article says that "" According to Quinn, there were perhaps 25 such burials a year, for a city of perhaps 500,000 people,""^(4) those are rookie numbers. "" According to WHO, **every year in the world there are an estimated 40-50 million abortions**. This corresponds to approximately **125,000 abortions per day**.""^(5)

We like to think of ourselves as ""evolved"" beyond the ""ignorant and barbaric ancients,"" but are we really so enlightened. I suppose it's fitting, though. Our god complex matches our condition. In ancient times, people sacrificed to idols. Now, we are the idols; we are the god. We sacrifice our children to the wise and powerful ""Us.""

We even glorify the practice. **Far from** drowning out the screams of our sacrifices and our grieving members with drumming and flutes, we encourage people to make the noise themselves. We are told to ""Shout \[our\] abortion\[s\]!"" with hashtags, books, T-shirts, and *comedy* routines. To tell the whole world about our stories of abortion. To normalize it; to paint *ourselves* as the victim--the victim that overcame an ""obstacle"" and became heroines.

We even use sopher clamps (an instrument used to dismember, disembowel, and crush the skull of a preborn child in an abortion) to anoint our Christmas trees!^(6) What fun! Also, I might add, quite ironic, as Christmas is a holiday celebrating the birth of a child--the birth of God (in human flesh)--the coming of our Savior. It seems fitting though, doesn't it? The birth of a child replaced with the death of a child; The ""birth"" of God with the ""death"" of God, Him being replaced with us taking His throne as the rightful leader; The Anointed One (that's what Christ and Messiah mean btw), the Savior on a tree replaced with the anointment of the savior of those clamps on a tree.

""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" (John 3:16 KJV) Perhaps *that* ought to be replaced with ""For we so loved ourselves, that we gave our only begotten son... and that's all folks!""

In conclusion, child sacrifice still happens today and it's still barbaric. In some ways, less than ancient times; in some ways, more. We might have exchanged the cauldron and hands with stirrups and clamps, but *ultimately* there's nothing new under the sun.

"Dear fellow pro lifers, I need some more information on embryology and the fetus's metaphysics","Dear fellow pro lifers, an apologist for the devil (literally, the guy was defending TST) and I were debating the personhood of the fetus. Instead of using the distinction between ""human"" and ""clump of cells"", I used the distinction between ""subject"" and ""object"".
It is possible to ""be"" a subject. It's inconceivable to ""be"" an object.

I said the baby was a subject and not a mere object either immediately AT conception, or when the brain forms.

Here are my questions:

1: We know the brain is the seat of consciousness, if we switch brains it will be you with my body, and me with yours, NOT you with my brain, and me with yours. The self, the person is intimately tied to the brain. The embryo is, for a bit, non-brained. The pro life movement asserts it is nonetheless a person. I need a bit more justification. Maybe I've missed something?

2: Zygotes can twin. But a frame of reference is indivisible.
So the original zygote's frame of reference ""being"" must be destroyed, and 2 new ones created, or the frame of reference inexplicably stays with one, and another is created. Or, there are no valid frames of reference and they are created later, rendering it an object. But, in all other situations one person can't become two. So should we look at it as a person pre-emptively and work backwards: ""Well, all you've done is prove one person can become 2 in this special case!"" or should we accept that it can become multiple, and work forwards to say: ""well, then it can't be an object"".",t2_ca4sk83n,1630820449,prolife

You’ve driven us away.,"I used to be with you. I grew up privileged to have a loving, married, religious family.

I made it through college a virgin, got married to a good man, still no children but I’m still young.

I’ve watched and listened as others in youth group strayed and were gossiped about. Treated like crap. I’ve listened to the stories of those who have been abused.

I was ok with banning abortion until I realized most of the world isn’t lucky enough to remain unmolested and be educated and save to afford the best care for a child.

I never realized my sister was a victim until recently and was denied the happiness and peace of mind I’ve always had. That silently, to avoid shame and condemnation, they suffer and pretend while elders rant about premarital sex. She kept dating her rapist for nearly 3 years because she thought she was damaged goods despite the fact she did NOT choose to do so.

In several states, abortion laws creep towards banning abortion even in cases of rape or incest. You argue, why make an innocent child pay for the act? And I now truly believe that you can’t be the judge - only God can - if one can live with making a choice.

She got lucky she didn’t get pregnant because she would have lost everything. My parents would never have understood- trust me, as a virgin teenager one rough morning dealing with puberty stuff, my mom screamed at me and accused me of being pregnant. Not unless there’s a second coming, mom. 

She was on their insurance and still is, nearly done with a pharmacology program. She’ll have a doctorate and will continue being a strong, beautiful person. She was too afraid to get the morning after pill in fear that they’d know. Imagine if she’d checked later and found out she was pregnant.

She wouldn’t have been able to continue her program. She still feels like damaged goods and I am going to try my best to ensure she is well and happy. The preaching that is so quick as Catholics to condemn and judge while forgetting we are mortals and not the judges ourselves. Should she have had to carry her rapist’s baby at 18 and fight battles many of you have never imagined, legal and emotional and full of inner conflict?

I don’t support abortion for “because I felt like it.” I never will. Unless the world is made perfect there have to be cases where it is allowed. 

If you truly want no babies to need to be aborted before they’re born, fight for those who suffer to birth them. 

Fight for victims of PPD and trauma. 

Fight for actual punishments for abusers, for preventing abortions with comprehensive sex education. 

Fight for universal healthcare so that the young and naiive have a future as parents and not having to sacrifice a future for a child or a child to have a future.

Demand it and treat pregnant young people with compassion and support, not sneering distaste, repulsion, and intentionally shaming them. It’s funny how many other sins are listed in the bible, such as unfaithfulness, and allegories about throwing stones, and there are innumerable posts from women suffering mistreatment from their families. All of these changes start at home and in your community.

You’ll have to bring us back with incredible compassion or you’ll lose the future of your congregations. After all, the odds aren’t in your favor anymore.

Why bodily autonomy arguments fail,"Bodily autonomy arguments rely on granting the pro-life premise that a zygote is a person to a woman, based on accepting the premise that conception is the beginning of a person with a right to life. Autonomy arguments argue that women have the right to withhold their bodily resources from other people, and so they also have the right to withhold their bodily resources from the zygote ""person."" 

It is at fault for a woman who caused the existence of a person. It is not the case that women are required to give bodily resources (such as organ or blood resources) to another person that they didn't directly cause the existence of or where the persons do not continuously depend upon the woman for basic things such as oxygen and food. 

But it is required of women to give bodily resources to persons that they did cause to exist and to those persons for as long as they continuously depend upon the woman provided that the woman's life is not in danger. 

Nobody should ever force a woman to reproduce. But birth is not reproduction. Conception is reproduction. By the time the abortion is procured, reproduction has already occurred. And if the woman engaged in activities that led to reproduction by her own free will then she has a moral duty to give bodily resources to the person that she caused to exist for as long as that person that continuously depends upon the woman.",t2_13kzqx,1630793226,prolife

"With the medical research available, nobody has an excuse for being pro-choice.","Hello, I wrote a report on the subject of abortion for a high school English paper, and I thought I should share some of the sources I used (although not the essay itself because I can't access it and may not be able to legally copy and paste it), as well as an explanation of why the government has the duty to protect life, regardless of whether people believe abortion should or is a right.

First of all, I'll address the legal reasons people believe abortion should be permitted: The government has the constitutional duty to protect life, and we can't stoop to a point where we consider those at less stages of development to not be worthy of life, or of otherwise being 'less than human'. Throughout history amendments have been added to protect rights like this, such as with the slaves and the passing of the 13th amendment, and the repeal of the 3/5th compromise, which was used to justify mistreatment of blacks for being 'less than human'.  

Secondly, there is a moral/ethical reason to oppose abortion, and support its ban from all of society, for any and all reasons.   


In the following paragraphs I'll address some issues regarding detection of pain perception, heartbeats, the fetus being able to move on its own, in addition to the fetus being its own separate being genetically, which I hope will indicate to the pro-choice that abortion cannot be ethical, at the very least past a certain stage of development (although I am confident that the act of abortion is murder at any stage). 

Much of my research comes from the Lozier Institute, in addition to some sources which have been used in the past be left-wing outlets such as the New York Times, before they were all unabashedly pro-abortion. Sources from the Lozier Institute are listed below, and come from this [source](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/) (written in 2020). Note that additional sources are linked with a number, like '\[8\]'.  

**There is growing evidence that the unborn can feel pain**

""The old, uninformed notions that unborn and newborn babies cannot feel pain are refuted by a growing body of scientific evidence. The published scientific literature shows that unborn babies can experience pain at 20 weeks gestational age"" (para. 1).

""A comprehensive review of the scientific literature[\[1\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn1) including neural development, psychology of pain sensation, and moral implications of fetal pain, concludes that unborn babies may experience pain as early as 12 weeks.

""The review notes that neural connections from periphery to brain are functionally complete after 18 weeks""(para. 2-3).

**How the unborn experience pain at heightened levels**

""Fetal reactions provide evidence of pain response. The unborn baby reacts to noxious stimuli"" (meaning the unborn baby reacts to a potential tissue-damaging event, for example, removing your hand immediately from a hot stove without thinking) ""with avoidance reactions and stress responses. As early as 8 weeks the baby exhibits reflex movement during invasive procedures.[\[9\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn9) There is extensive evidence of a hormonal stress response by unborn babies as early as 18 weeks [\[10\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn10) including “increases in cortisol, beta-endorphin, and decreases in the pulsatility index of the fetal middle cerebral artery.”[\[11\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn11)  Two independent studies in 2006 used brain scans of the sensory part of unborn babies’ brains, showing response to pain.[\[12\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn12)  They found a “clear cortical response” and concluded there was “the potential for both higher-level pain processing and pain-induced plasticity in the human brain from a very early age”(para. 9). 

""In 2010 one group noted that “the earlier infants are delivered, the stronger their response to pain.”[\[15\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn15) This increased sensitivity is due to the fact that the neural mechanisms that inhibit pain sensations do not begin to develop until 34-36 weeks , and are not complete until a significant time after birth.[\[16\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn16) This means that unborn, as well as newborn and preterm, infants show “hyperresponsiveness” to pain""(para. 12).

**In instances of early birth, appropriate care and treatment, more often than not, saves a baby's life**

""Survival of extremely preterm infants has increased significantly as doctors realize advantages of active care for such young patients. Ages of survival have dropped from 28 weeks to 24 weeks and now less than 22 weeks.[\[26\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn26)""(para. 17).

""A *Journal of Perinatology* study found that if extremely preterm babies were routinely given care, as many as 53% of those born at 22 weeks’ gestation survived, compared to only 8% if active care was not given,[\[28\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn28) challenging physician attitudes on survival as well as thoughts about the age limit of viability.[\[29\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn29)""(para. 19). 

""An NIH-funded study of infants who were delivered at 22-24 weeks and who received active treatment observed increasing rates of survival without any neurological impairment. Yet, three-fourths of those delivered at 22 weeks still received no active care. [\[32\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn32)""(para.22).

""60% of infants born at 22 weeks who receive active hospital treatment will survive. [\[33\]](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-science-of-fetal-pain/#_edn33)""(para. 23).

**And more references on the issue are on that page.** 

Anyway, I can understand the ethical argument for those who believe a fetus is 'not a human' or otherwise not a living being until a certain stage in pregnancy. For example, journalist Tim Pool, a liberal, talked about this when he made a video on the Texas Fetal Heartbeat bill, and in many ways I understood his reasoning (although I disagree with many of his claims on the issue itself). What I cannot respect, however, is how many people on the left, and now many conservatives, believe that no unborn child is alive, or otherwise not worth protecting at any stage of pregnancy. I am particularly referring to late-term abortions, where due to the fully-formed (or almost fully-formed body), anyone should know that at the very least, the unborn at this point would be human rather than 'a clump of cells' as many pro-choice people tend to use for their argument on why earlier-term abortions should be legal and/or are morally acceptable.

Secondly, the belief that abortion is a right assumes that the unborn child is not its own being, or otherwise not significant enough to have the right to life. Around 90% of abortions, on average, are performed with no stated reason (or otherwise elective), while a tiny minority are performed due to issues like rape, incest, or harm to the mother's life. The laws in the states that only allow abortion for rape or incest are also flawed, because they assume that the actions of the father can dictate the right to life of the unborn, and in the case of incest, pro-choice people believe that the actions of the parents and/or the chance of genetic abnormalities justify depriving that unborn being of life. In the rare case that a birth is likely to cause a mother to die, or otherwise cause both the mother and the unborn child to die, I do not believe performing an abortion is justified. Would murder for the sake of sparing a life be justified?

Otherwise, for the vast majority who have abortions for without a medical 'need' to, adoption is an option if you really can't take care of your child. I can respect typical left-wing views when it comes to having freedoms that clearly don't cause direct physical harm to others, and that don't take away the constitutional rights of others. Regardless of what the Supreme Court has decided on the constitutionality of the issue, abortion is not one of those freedoms, and current medical research can show why it shouldn't be.",t2_7prsvncl,1630788579,prolife

An abortion will be the only way (in this hypothetical) for the woman not to die. Because you are pro life shouldn’t we save the woman by getting an abortion?

And you may say in most cases the woman would be able to give birth, which is true but this is a hypothetical meaning there’s no other way that this can happen it’s going to happen this way so there’s no changing the outcome. Either she has an abortion and lives or gives birth, dies and the baby dies.

[SATIRE] What pro-choicers think about pro-lifers,"1. Every single pro-life person who is a woman has secretly had an abortion or would totally get one in the future.  

2. Pro-lifers only oppose abortion because they like telling women what to do. They have literally no other reason to oppose abortion.  

3. Restricting or denying abortions ultimately leads to death of pregnant women. If abortion were banned overnight in the States, 80 percent of women would be dead by 2024.  

4. A fetus is not a living child until pushed out by a vagina. The magical human vagina imbues the fetus with life as it is being pushed out.  

5. Every woman who ended up having to carry her child to term is miserable and angry with a ruined life, whether she gave it up for adoption or not. Please do not look up any statistics challenging this. Just believe it.  

6. Pregnancy is so horrendous, and so awful for women, that abortion is literally a kindness.  

7. Getting pregnant on accident because contraceptives failed is literally the same trauma as being raped.  

8. Banning abortion does not reduce abortion rates, it just makes them more dangerous for women. Also, banning abortion is evil because it means less women will be able to get abortions. Also banning abortion actually INCREASES abortion rates, while also forcing more women to carry babies to term that they didn't want. Don't question this logic.  

9. Banning abortion will cause all the events in The Handmaids Tale, a fictional book, to suddenly happen. Yes, it's true. Telling women they can no longer terminate their pregnancies will make America turn into Gilead, and all women will be made slaves to men and be raped and forced to give birth. It will totally happen.

Genuine Questions About Pro-Life,"Hello Reddit! I am 15 years old, and have recently been curious about the perspective of Pro-Lifers.

While I wouldn't call myself either Pro-Life or Pro-choice, I have been raised in a household that believes that abortion is something that can be done in cases where the baby is a result of non consensual procreation, or other cases like that, but is unacceptable if it was created with a partner you consented with. I truly wish to know about pro life views, and if it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience, answer my questions!

1. Is there any time abortion is acceptable other than if it is a threat to the mothers life? or is even that unacceptable?
2. If so, what are those times?
3.    If a baby is truly unwanted, to the point where it would be unloved or better off away from those parents, but is carried to term, what would you propose done with it?
4. Would you personally be willing to provide fiscal and raising aid to a mother who would otherwise get an abortion?
5. Would you take a baby and raise it yourself if it meant that it would not be aborted? 

Thank you for taking the time to read through my questions, and if you choose to answer them, thank you even more!",t2_7o64k6e6,1630756994,prolife

"Brain Death, Potential Life, and Ability","So a lot of pro choicers bring up the fact that doctors use brain death to determine whether someone dies. So using that, they would apply that to fetuses who haven’t had a brain developed yet. 

Essentially, I would suppose this is the neurological view. 

My 2 initial responses is that 1, it’s arbitrary, and 2, if someone is brain dead, it’s permanent. 

I think there is some standing pronounce someone dead by brain activity. But that’s not my main confusion. 

My main confusion is with point 2. The difference is that one is permanent and the other still has the ability to do so. But then that just sounds like the potential life argument. Like we wouldn’t ask surgery students to perform surgery even though they have the ability to become surgeons. 

But then again, I’m sort of conflicted on that as well. If we define consciousness as the definition of life, then someone who loses it would be considered dead. But obviously we wouldn’t pull the plug on someone who is in a coma. Because they still have the ability to become conscious. Just not right now, perhaps a few months later. 

So similarly, for brain activity, the logic in the consciousness scenario could be applied here. But that seems contradictory to the surgery student situation. 

So am I drawing a false equivalency with the surgery student situation or the consciousness situation, and why? Because both situations give two different answers, even though they seem similar.",t2_518sdac7,1630745861,prolife

Secular pro-life arguments are inherently speciesist,"Secular pro-life arguments say that because a fetus is biologically human it is worthy of the same moral consideration as any other person. As such secular pro-life arguments rest upon the assumption that the only thing which gives life worth, the only thing that bestows personhood is a life being a member of the human species. 

By making this claim secular pro-life arguments devalue and degrade all forms of non-human life. If what grants life value is it being human then all non-human life holds no value. Animals would be worthy of no moral consideration because due to them being not biologically human, their life would hold no value. 

To move more into more speculative areas, this would also mean that any potential intelligent non-human life would have no value. One of my favorite movies is District 9, a movie about an alien species of beings who are oppressed and whose existence is devalued by humans, who due to the aliens being non-human see no value or worth in their existence. Stories such as these make a very convincing case that life's worth and value do not stem from something being biologically human, but rather consciousness, sentience, etc. You might say that this is just sci-fi, but sci-fi has throughout its existence explored moral and philosophical questions, such as what grants life worth and meaning. 

I am an atheist and pro-choice, as I firmly believe that life is not granted value by something being biologically human. The traits which grant life value are that which a fetus is not capable of having, despite it being biologically human. A fetus is essentially equivalent to the philosophical zombie, a hypothetical being that is physically identical to and indistinguishable from a normal person but does not have [conscious experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness), [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), or [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience). It might be human, but it is for a time incapable of all that which grants human beings personhood. So all pro-lifers that see this.

Addressing common misinformation about the Texas Heartbeat Law,"Hey y'all, I'm pretty familiar with this law so I just wanted to address some lies I've heard from anti-lifers about it.

MYTH: Abortion is now fully illegal in Texas.
FACT: A physician must attempt to detect a child's heartbeat before committing an abortion. He must use methods that are standard medical practice. If a heartbeat is detected, the abortion is illegal. If no heartbeat is detected, that abortion is still legal. (Pg 4 lines 2-7)

MYTH: Woman will be held liable for their abortions.
FACT: The new law explicitly states that a mother cannot be held responsible for the illegal abortion of her child. Women have been lied to for 50 years in this country, and we need to promote a positive culture of life. (Pg 5 lines 8-11)

MYTH: We are making doctors into criminals.
FACT: Nobody is being turned into a criminal. This law is enforced through civil means, not criminal means. Anyone who performs an illegal abortion, or aids &amp; abets in an illegal abortion, must pay damages in civil court. (Most of the bill details the civil enforcement procedure)

MYTH: If you have a miscarriage, someone might report you for that. All miscarriages are at the risk of being investigated.
FACT: Again, mothers are not held liable. Only those who perform, induce, or aid and abet in the illegal abortion are liable. If someone is found to have knowingly caused the death of that child, that person is responsible.

MYTH: A rapist can bring a suit against his victim who gets an abortion and collect a ""bounty"".
FACT: A person who impregnated a woman by rape, sexual assault, incest, or any prohibited sexual act cannot bring a suit against anyone involved in his victim's illegal abortion. (Pg 9 lines 13-16)

MYTH: You can be sued for accidentally aiding in an illegal abortion.
FACT: In order to be liable, someone must knowingly engage in conduct that aids or abets the performance of an illegal abortion. If it was not a person's intention to help a woman procure an illegal abortion, then that person is not responsible. (Pg 6 lines 14-20)

MYTH: You can be sued if you simply talk to someone about abortion or morally support their abortion.
FACT: Someone is only liable under this law if the materially assist in the procurement of an illegal abortion. (Legal definition of aid &amp; abet)

Pro-Lifers need to be educated about this law. Similar legislation is already being filed in other states.",t2_15yzft,1630744642,prolife
What should be the fathers role?,"First post here but I have recently gotten into a heated discussion with some family friends and want some opinions.

So, pregnancy tests, doctor visits, ultrasounds, baby supplies, possible lost wages because of the pregnancy, delivery costs, extra house hold expenses, regardless if he is in the kids life. My family friend believes that it should only be the court allotted child support that depends on his income. He also mentioned that it is possible that they do not know who the father is, but I believe there should be mandated DNA tests for all the potential fathers (so all sexual partners of the mother) till a match is found. 

I believe the child should get equal support from both parents and that both people who made the child are responsible. Any opinions?",t2_17q4ln1,1630744499,prolife

"Ah, I don't really know how to phrase this, because I know it'll probably offend people, but here goes, why is early stage abortion different to masterbation?","So, fetuses in early stage pregnancy don't have a brain yet, and can't feel pain. If they are aborted then why is it different to when sperm is destroyed, just through normal masterbation?

Even if it's mixed with an egg it's still just a cell, or a few cells anyway, and is still basically just sperm plus an egg, and the egg isn't living, it's just a place for the sperm to develop, so I fail to see how a sperm put into one is that different to sperm by itself.

And sperm dies after about 74 days even if it isn't ejulated, so it dies even if a man doesn't masterbate, I don't really understand how sperm dying is different to early stage pregnancy.",t2_73c31bcz,1630732673,prolife

“Am i my brother’s keeper?”,"Disclaimer: this post is about a religious argument. The main point of the post works outside of religious context, but if you’d rather not see any, move along



A week or two ago, our pastor was going thru Genesis, specifically the story of Cain and Abel. We all know the story, right?

The pastor made a point of one passage in particular though, the one in the title. This wasn’t just Cain denying his guilt, this was Cain denying any responsibility for his brother’s wellbeing. He had no desire to live in community with his own flesh and blood, instead simply envying the praise Abel received for a cheerful offering.

I think you can see where I’m going with this. It’s not just a matter of killing anymore. It’s our entire cultural mindset that is broken. We don’t ask about other’s wellbeing. In fact, we take _offense_ to others implying we owe any amount of care to people who haven’t given to them yet. It’s not an entirely selfish society, mind you, but this “tit for tat” mentality (that is, cheerfully helping those who already helped you, but scorning those who scorned you) goes hand in hand with both our vengeance-porn obsession and our rampant consumerism. Our culture of service is in its sick bed, as people would far rather give money than time. They can take my taxes and promise me 15% go to helping others, but the world forbid that I actually try to help anyone _myself_

"Personhood versus Life: A question from someone ""Pro-Choice""","So as Texas's abortion/vigilante law is not being blocked by the Supreme Court, abortion has obviously become a hot topic right now. As someone who's struggled with the abortion question more than any other major viewpoint, I believe I have a fairly consistent and logical position. I don't have many staunch pro-life people in my direct life to discuss the topic with, so am looking to understand ""your"" ""side"" better and maybe has out my own ideas better.

To start, I'd like to clarify a few terms:
- Thankfully this subreddit seems to define the pro-life line pretty clearly. For the sake of this post, I'll work with pro-life meaning abortion is wrong at any point because life begins at conception. I'll leave out cases of rape and incest for now. (If anyone's rebuttal's or stances aren't actually that life begins at conception, please feel free to correct me. The goal of this post is understanding)
- I've seen some.... interesting takes in this sub so far as to what pro-choice people believe. So would also like to clarify that most ""abortionists"" don't *like* abortion. Terminating a fetus isn't something that gives 99.9999% of the population any semblance of joy. I don't enjoy paying taxes, but absolutely believe in having and raising them. Especially for the sake of this post at least, I do not enjoy terminating a fetus. 
- I don't love the label of pro-choice because there's about an 8 month window of where the line may lay, and people on the SB8 side are radically different from those on the ""third trimester abortions side,"" even though both technically allow for abortion, just at different scales.

My view: I believe that a person's life is the ultimate right they have. As such, I think that once a fetus can be described as ""an alive person,"" the right of the mother to abort ends. The only thing that can trounce a person's right to live is their own concious action, of which a fetus/baby physically can't take. 
I don't believe a person can be said to be alive at the point of conception, and obviously don't believe in infanticide, so somewhere between those two points is when personhood (and therefore the right to life) begins.
Brain death is, at least at our current medical understanding, the true end to a person's life. A heartbeat is not a good indicator that they're still alive. We can keep a person's organs alive by keeping their heart pumping, but the conciousness, the person inside that body, is gone and can't come back. People's hearts stop all the time. 
Therefore, I believe complex brain wave activity is a consistent metric for defining personhood/life as beginning. Not just basic neurons forming or firing, but significant neural activity. Sometimes, you can squeeze a loved one's hand and feel them squeeze back as a sign of life, but this is unfortunately a neural reflex. 
This level of brain development happens in the second trimester, although exactly when is tough to pinpoint and is different for each fetus. Therefore, I think that anywhere in the second trimester is a reasonable point to cut off abortion. 12-24 weeks, although legally I wiuld obviously want to define a much narrower window and instill a test requirement for those seeking abortions too close to the window. Before that point, I believe abortion should be legal.


I welcome any and all crticisms, questions, etc. Those of you who believe life starts at conception, when do you think life ends? If you agree to my definition of end of life, why not the beginning? Those of you who can agree with my definition of life beginning but still are against abortion, why?

The Satanic Temple is scamming its members. Let's not tell them. 😉,"If you spend any time on r/all, you've likely heard of an organization called the satanic Temple.

They're a satanist organization that claims religion is a sacred practice for its members, and thus should be allowed a religious exemption for abortion, as protected by the constitutional right to religious freedom. 

The problem (or benefit, from our point of view), is that it's quite settled that that isn't how the first amendment works. The first amendment allows freedom of belief and opinion, but it still permits the government to restrict behaviours. Most famously, this standard was used in Reynolds v. United States, where the court upheld laws prohibiting Mormons from marrying multiple people. 

Now, could Reynolds V. United States get overturned? Sure. But here's what would have to happen for the ST to become remotely useful.

1. A pro life law is passed and signed by a governor. 

2. It makes it ALL the way to the supreme Court. 

3. The court overturns Roe. V. Wade.

4. That same court that litteraly just overturned roe v Wade then turns right around and forces abortion to be legal AGAIN, but only to people who subscribe to a self proclaimed fake religion.

Obviously, that's never going to happen. As tempting as it is to taunt Pro-choicers with this information, don't. If they want to waste their time energy, and money on a bunch of scammers and trolls instead of effective activism, more power to us 😁.",t2_1yf4ntd9,1630725547,prolife

There are certain reasons why we don’t enforce certain views on people, but to say plainly you shouldn’t is going against what a democracy is designed for.

Just want to understand why prolife is so adamant on banning abortions.,"As a woman who decided that I wouldn't get an abortion if gotten pregnant as I am fortunate enough to be able to raise a child. But at the same time I wouldn't want to project my choice onto another woman who is not ready and is forced carry the pregnancy to term. 

There are already laws that limit abortions such as california where you can get an abortion up to 6 months into the pregnancy. Any later than that then you have to get an exception if carrying the fetus to term would threaten the life of the mother. Which sounds reasonable. Although I do think the time should be adjusted to less than 6 months as technologies have improved survival rate of premature baby that have been born 22 weeks old.

In my eyes if a fetus can survive outside of the womb then there should be limits on abortion services. If it's literally a cluster of cells and will not survive outside of the womb then its find to terminate the pregnancy. 

And don't give me that a zygote is life therefore it's a human reason it's debatable. My reasoning is if the fetus can stay alive with or without incubators outside of the womb don't abort it unless the life of the mother is endanger. 

So why are people so adamant to ban all abortions?",t2_chs5wry,1630709672,prolife

TLDR: I strongly suspect a universal basic income would reduce abortion rates significantly.,"With abortion being a hot topic in the news I am getting a lot of people asking if I am willing to pay more taxes to take care of more kids and my answer is absolutely yes! 

In fact I am willing to do so for the kids we have already, I just want to make sure it is spent well. 

I have been pushing some version of this for years now. 

To address the problems I see in other UBI proposals I suggest the following be seriously studied. 

1) The poverty level to be set after every census to the lowest amount at which a person can afford the basic amounts of clothing, food, healthcare, shelter, education and transportation needed to participate in society.
2) The poverty level to be increased with inflation and decreased with deflation annually between censuses.
3) The abolishment of all existing welfare programs (including corporate welfare), for social security programs to stop accepting new participants, and for the removal of minimum wage laws.
4) The establishment a universal basic income of no less than the poverty level for every citizen (from conception until death).
5) Free relocation to fill demonstrated gaps in the workforce of rural communities.

A Hypothetical Ethical Parallel to Abortion [LONG POST],"Here is a hypothetical that is slightly adapted from another. Its parallel to abortion should be obvious. Its takes a few minutes to read. There is no TL;DR. Only read it if you have time and want something to consider.

I am evaluating my position and stance on abortion in the cases of rape in incest, so any other perspectives are very welcome.

# The Hypothetical

Suppose that you were walking down the street, when a car rolls up beside you, drugs you, and kidnaps you.

You wake up on a table, hooked up to a machine, and opposite you is a person on a table. Your kidnapper tells you these seven things:

1. The person opposite you has a condition that has rendered them comatose.
2. Their condition has completely destroyed their kidneys, which function at 0%.
3. You are hooked up to them via some machine and IV, and their blood is being filtered by your kidneys. The person who kidnapped you doesn't share their blood type, so they cannot be hooked into them.
4. You are free to leave the room, however, this would cause the other person to die.
5. In nine months, a dialysis machine will be available, but the stress of filtering their blood will leave your body forever changed, possibly severely.
6. Should this person ever wake up, their brain function will never be that of an able person, but they won't be vegetative if they do, and will have some kind of life.
7. The comatose person would not have wanted you to be kidnapped to save them.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Analysis

There are only two decisions which can be made here:

1. Sacrificing your freedom and body, and staying in the room until 9 months have elapsed.
2. Leaving the room, and thereby causing the death of an innocent person.

***Neither choice here is ethical***. Our decision is between two very bad things, and we are forced to pick the lesser of two grave evils. The first choice causes the death of an innocent person, and the other seriously violates our bodily autonomy. My final decision is that a person should decide stay, but that no blanket decision should be made for everyone.

Some may argue that, because you were forced into this situation, the guilt of the death of the comatose person would fall upon the kidnapper. However, I believe you still maintain *some* amount of guilt if you choose to leave. Here is my reasoning: if the kidnapper had instead forced you to pick between killing two people with a gun, or killing one, both of your choices remain unethical, but by killing two people, you caused a death that you didn't have to, and are thus guilty of at least one death. My point is that the previous ethical decisions of another person don't totally absolve someone from guilt in a situation where they are forced between two evils. The comatose person bears no guilt for the actions of the kidnapper. They are totally innocent of any wrongdoing, and *the guilt which you bear for their death is thus proportionate to your other options*. For example, if staying in the room was paid, didn't require your body, was otherwise comfortable, and you chose to enter the room, then you would be guilty and the person mediating this dialysis transaction would be totally innocent. But, if staying required your life, then you would bear no guilt for leaving and the kidnapper would bear all of it. Therefore, I believe the guilt of their death is somewhat upon us if we choose to leave.

Another semi-utilitarian argument focuses on the comatose person. They would argue that because they will be disabled if they wake up, it would be better to just let them die now, rather than forcing them to live with a disability, and that we would maximize happiness overall if we decided to leave. I don't think I have to point out the ableism of this argument. The presumption that a person's life who has a disability is inherently less happy or meaningful is not a choice that we can make for another, and therefore it cannot be a factor in our decision.

Other's focus on the universalizability of our decision, that is, if our decision is okay if *everyone* in this situation chose exactly what we did? If everyone chose to leave, then we would all agree that we value individual bodily autonomy over the life of another innocent person. Similarly, if everyone chose to stay, we would value life over individual autonomy. Both of these choices have terrible implications. If we value life over autonomy, then we would also agree that conscription of soldiers into our countries army against their will is an ethical decision as long as it saves more lives than it takes. If we strictly value autonomy over life, then any line we draw between a person who is and isn't autonomous will include some subsection of disabled people. Again we are stuck between two awful decisions.

Virtue ethics at the individual level leads to the only tenable solution in my opinion. We may be able to decide individually whether we wish to be the kind of person who sacrifices their bodily autonomy to save the life of an innocent person, or the type of person who values their individual autonomy over the life of an innocent person. The former is more virtuous in my opinion than the alternative. The only issue is when we scale this thinking up, we are stuck with the issue of universalizability and its awful implications again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, my personal conclusion is this: forcing someone to leave or stay in the room as an implication of a universal ideal which values life over autonomy is dangerous and shouldn't be done. However, it is more virtuous to decide for yourself to remain in the room and sacrifice your bodily autonomy to save the life of the innocent person than it is to leave.

# Translating My Conclusion to Abortion

I would then conclude from my previous reasoning that it is unethical to create laws concerning abortion in the case of rape and incest, but that anyone who decides to get an abortion in the case where they are forced into pregnancy or the baby will be seriously disabled has made an unethical decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note, in the case where a woman got pregnant by her own choices, this conclusion wouldn't stand. The hypothetical would have to be adapted, and *I would conclude* ***in that situation*** *that it is never ethical to leave the room*.",t2_2bkv9m3y,1630693456,prolife

What about lives lost in illegal abortions?,"I posted this earlier on r/Abortiondebate hoping to get responses from pro-lifers but I mostly got responses from pro-choicers speaking on behalf of pro-lifers. Things got ugly pretty quickly and the moderators had to remove a lot of comments so I thought I might have better luck asking here.

This is something I don't often see being brought up in abortion discussions, at least not as often as other arguments. I think it's a very important thing to consider, especially from a pro-life perspective. Pro-life is rooted in the ideal of saving lives and this is why they believe abortion is wrong and should be illegal. I see a problem with this when you factor in illegal abortions.

Making abortion illegal doesn't completely stop people from getting them. It just makes a large number of women seek illegal and, often, unsafe methods to get an abortion. Sometimes this results in the death of the mother as well as the fetus. This now causes the deaths of two people (if you believe a fetus is a person like pro-life people typically do) instead of just one. How is that better?

In addition, even many pro-lifers seem to believe that a mother's life has more weight to it than a fetus's since some believe abortion as a method to save a mother's life is acceptable. For those who believe this, that means the mother's death in a botched abortion carries even more weight than the death of a fetus in an abortion.

Knowing all of this, why isn't it better to let women choose safe methods to get an abortion instead of inviting more deaths in illegal abortions?",t2_8iwxa2s,1630690723,prolife

Does anyone else find it difficult being friends with pro-choicers?,"I’ve had my doubts about abortion for a while now, but only fully turned to pro-life in the last year or so. My personal view is a moral one, rather than religious, and was informed partly by personal experience - my beloved grandma was born to a teenaged single mother who gave her up for adoption - but mostly by a great deal of thinking and reading. 

I view abortion as barbaric. I think it is evil, and only somewhat justified when the mother’s life is threatened. My change in opinion - not that I ever held a firm one hitherto - coincided with me beginning to appreciate life, which solidified my new beliefs i.e. how can I condone a life never lived when I enjoy my life so much.

These revelations have made me struggle in my friendships. I find it difficult to divorce them, the people, from their pro-choice beliefs that do genuinely make me feel nauseous. It’s not something we discuss, but it does prey on my mind. I don’t mind political differences; heck my friend and I used to have ‘debates’, as we called them, on matters all the time, but there was a basic understanding that the other was a good person acting in good faith.

Why I’m pro-choice. Would love to get your thoughts!,"Let’s get right to it. On the issue of abortion, I believe that the pro-life position is unnecessarily restrictive. From the perspective of both the woman and the potential child, abstinence, contraception and abortion before the fetus can think or feel are all ethically justified since the consequences are exactly the same for the potential person. They never get to experience consciousness. If my parents had abstained from sex, used contraception, or aborted me as a fetus before 24 weeks, it would all be the same to me. There would never be a 'me' - a conscious being - to experience it in any way. 

Given that this is the case, and given that (by contrast) the potential mother *would* suffer if she carried an unwanted pregnancy to term, the right to choose abstinence, contraception, or abortion should be with the potential mother until this point. After 24 weeks however, when the fetus begins to lay down neural pathways, feel pain, etc, we should then consider the rights of the fetus as well as the mother.  

In the case of a coma patient, we have another ethical question entirely because they are not dependent on anyone else's body for their existence and so the decision only need consider what is in their best interests. Minimizing harm would necessitate that we keep such a person alive and do our best to bring them back to good health.",t2_38qy6ydl,1630682538,prolife

"Ironically, for every pro-life victory lately, I feel like we lose the culture war a little bit more.","I live in Texas. Greg Abbott's an \*\*\*wipe. He's voted against benefits for disabled people, cut spending for underprivileged education, and more. And having him be the one to pass this law makes our side look worse.

""Be careful what you wish for,"" ""be glad we got *something*,"" I know, I know. And this will curb abortions for sure, but it's gonna look like it was his idea and the movement's gonna become even more associated with the far-right than before and *ugh.* I'm happier that this happened than I am mad at the fact that Abbott had anything to do with it, but all I've seen on the Internet is complaining.

I'm not confrontational. I relate heavily to this meme: 

https://preview.redd.it/l42dt19xx6l71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d557ae39894315c7dc401a20bb2b5fd9b0de512d

I tried to calmly rebuke a YouTuber I follow about the topic earlier and even though their response was actually quite respectful I still found myself crying about how much I hate fighting over this in the first place. I still haven't responded because I'm *scared.* I'm scared how I don't see other people taking a pro life stance outside of my own echo chamber, and I'm scared that I won't represent our side in a nuanced, kind way. I'm scared of those on our side who shoot up abortion clinics and turn pregnant teens away from the border because ""they're just trying to get a handout."" I'm scared of those on the other side who look so much *smarter* than I do because behind that wall of text I can't hear any fear or wavering they may have. Everyone looks confident on the Internet.

Whenever something like this happens there's so much pushback. Even I have to wonder sometimes if the ""whatever% of \[demographic\] are pro-life"" arguments are true because I've seen this side lie their asses off before. We *don't* look good to the other side, and I'm worried we never will, especially if we continue to plug our ears whenever they say anything. Heck, I ran away from the discussion I mentioned in the last paragraph - I don't want to be a hypocrite and I believe what I say but I get too wound up to say it.

A real question,"I have a genuine question for pro-lifers. Is a child’s life that is lived in extreme poverty, drugs, abuse, etc, a better life than having never been born at all? I know the argument that this is America, anyone can improve their situation. But that’s not the case for most people. It’s the exception, not the rule. Would you, as pro-lifers, be willing to adopt these children? To give them the home and life they deserve to have. A life that could be afforded to them if they weren’t born into a forced situation like this? Why is life for life’s sake more important than quality of life? I’m curious. 

And please refrain from using religious justifications as that has no place in government and therefore should not have been a consideration for this law. So I’m genuinely curious as to why this happened.

A list of the reasons why I converted from pro-choice to pro-life,"I used to work at an abortion clinic and I saw some extremely fucked up shit there which is why I'm so anti-abortion now. This is just SOME of the horrible stuff I personally witnessed:

• ⁠A 23 year old woman came in 11 months into her pregnancy and said ""I don't want my stupid baby anymore, kill it"" and the doctor said ""okay"" and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight

• ⁠A little 8-year old girl wandered in and said ""I want an abortion but I am not pregnant"" and the doctor said ""we'll fix that"" and he stole a baby and cut the girl open and put the baby inside her and sewed her shut and then woke the girl up and said ""congratulations it's a healthy six year old boy"" and the girl said ""can I keep him"" and the doctor said no and then backed over her in the parking lot with his brand new Ford Raptor

• ⁠They made me sign an agreement promising to stop drinking from the medical waste container (I signed somebody else's name)

• ⁠One of the doctors there developed a futuristic ray gun that could make anything he shot have an abortion, even trees, cars, or barns

• ⁠The receptionist threw nail polish at an elderly man

• ⁠The doctor's assistant invented this thing she called ""the silly slide"" and it was a really fun little water slide that connected a woman's vagina to a paper shredder so a newborn baby could briefly ""enjoy the high life""

• ⁠The oldest child we aborted was in his late 70s, we didn't even know he was a baby until his wife brought in photos

• ⁠The doctors put all sorts of crap up a woman's uterus including a clown nose, bicycle handlebars, a calendar, and an entire Sears retail outlet (before bankruptcy)

• ⁠During every successful abortion, the doctor would shout ""take that, baby"" and he'd push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we'd all get Del Taco for free",t2_8fkhp2hk,1630623561,prolife

My Abortion Story :),"Hello all! This is my story regarding abortion and I'd like for you all to hear it. This took me a very long time to be courageous enough to speak out about and it is still so hard for me to talk about so please be kind! 

I do believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as they do not try and force it upon anyone else. That being said, I am pro-choice but I'd like to share my experience with abortion.

This took place a couple years ago, when I was around 20. I was attending the college of my dreams and I found the guy of my dreams! Everything could have been perfect, except it wasn't. I  struggled with an eating disorder since I was in high school, and I relapsed in college. I got diagnosed with depression when I was 17 following the loss of a family member. The so called guy of my dreams was really just an emotionally manipulative man who fulfilled the desire to be wanted in me. My parents moved back to their home country after my brother and I both went to college. I had no financial support. 

One night, we attended a party together and got drunk. After the party, it all went downhill. Long story short, I got pregnant against my consent. When my then-boyfriend found out, he left me. Said he couldn't. Keep in mind this is the same man who said he'd stay with me forever. Made promises of marriage and a family together.

So. I was 20. 2 years away from graduating with a masters degree. Struggling with depression and an eating disorder. Had no financial support and I was $150,000 in debt in student loans. And the father of the growing baby left me. 

I had a terrible relationship with my body image- and being pregnant 11 weeks in definitely did not help that. I was extremely frail- my body wouldn't have been able to carry the baby. And with my eating disorder and depression, the baby wouldn't have been able to come out healthy. I put down my cash and visited the doctor- where I got the news that carrying out the pregnancy could kill me or the baby or both.

So I did what I had to do in that position to save my career and save the baby from living through a lifetime of hardships and to *save my life.*

Now, I'd grown up in a very conservative household. Younger me wouldn't have ever thought I'd grow up to advocate for pro-choice. But things change!! And I'm not here to advocate for anything- just to share my story and say that it's ok if you change your perspective :)",t2_d34jklxw,1630620680,prolife

Roe vs. Wade is bad legislative practice,"People talk about *Roe* being settled law but I’m not so sure that’s right. The constitution says nothing about pregnancy or abortion. The right to abortion is not overtly protected by the constitution. The Supreme Court ruling that established a right to abortion was and still is controversial. It was derived from the right to privacy, which *is* protected by the constitution.  
  
In my opinion, it is not a good idea to make law in this way i.e. by Supreme Court decision. If America truly wants to guarantee the right to abortion they should pass a constitutional amendment to establish that right explicitly. Otherwise this debate will continue endlessly.  
  
And by the way, RBG felt the same way about *Roe*. Although she supported the decision, she felt that legislating from the bench on contentious social issues was not the right way to settle matters, because such decisions do not enjoy democratic legitimacy.",t2_diojre1m,1630618956,prolife

Anyway, back to what the title of this post says.

"There are legitimate worries and problems with this Texas law, even from a pro-life standpoint.","I don't know if this sort of post is allowed - I'll let the admins and mods decide. But:

Although many of us are celebrating the passage (for now) of the Texas abortion law, I don't think we should dismiss or handwave some of the legit, non-abortion related problems that this law causes. Just because a law is pro-life doesn't necessarily mean it's problem-free.

&amp;#x200B;

The law essentially means **you no longer need standing in order to bring a lawsuit.** Previously, you had to have ""legal standing"" to sue someone - that is, you had to have been personally injured *yourself* in some way in order to bring a suit. But now this Texas law says you don't need that anymore. Even if a woman who is completely unrelated to you gets an abortion, you can now sue her abortion provider. 

This has enormous ramifications. It means that, in the future, a liberal state like California could allow people to sue gun shops merely for the act of selling guns, for instance - even if those gun sales had absolutely zero effect on the people doing the suing. Or a government could allow people to sue church pastors for preaching creationism or Christian schools for teaching Bible lessons, even if those things had zero effect on the people who are suing. Or people could be sued for writing books that criticize LGBT.

In other words, this law opens an enormous legal can of worms. It's a Pandora's Box that goes way beyond merely abortion in Texas. In fact, this precedent could be indirectly used, years from now, as a tool of persecution against Christians, pro-lifers or conservatives - just with a little bit of tweaking and adjustment. We could now get sued ourselves for anything, by people without standing.

There is a different, better way to ban abortion - simply ban it the ""proper"" way. Pass a federal law to ban abortion nationwide, have enough justices in the federal courts to uphold it, overturn Roe, and now have blanket banning of abortion in all 50 states. But this Texas law is doing it the wrong way. By creating a loophole to allow people to sue without standing, it is going to unleash enormous legal consequences down the road that may hurt us a lot more than it helps us.",t2_ud3skgp,1630612673,prolife

A random experience with my son made me think about how bodily autonomy doesn't excuse doing harm to your child,"So my 1-year-old son is learning to walk by grabbing on to the edge of the couch and stepping along the side. If I'm sitting on one of the couch cushions, I usually sit with my legs crossed so my feet are hanging at about the level of where he puts his hands. Sometimes he comes over grabs my foot to steady himself and because he doesn't understand what he's doing yet, he sometimes digs his nails into my skin. This is obviously uncomfortable and my first instinct is to pull my foot away but if I did that he would topple over and possibly get hurt. 

To me, this is an example how bodily autonomy isn't a good enough excuse to hurt and kill your child. I have every right to pull my foot away from my son especially when he is hurting me but in doing so I would be putting my child at risk. And instead, I'm patient and help move him along so he is no longer digging his nails into my skin and can continue practicing walking in a safe manner. In that moment, he needed my body to stay steady, but there was a time not too long ago where he needed my body to stay alive. If I removed my foot, as it was my right to do, and he fell down and severely hurt himself, I would be seen as cruel or even abusive. But when someone rips a child out of their body, that isnt scene as cruel to their child but just an exercise in their rights. 


Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean that that is what you ought to do especially if that right would cause you to hurt your child. 

(For context, I had a particularly brutal pregnancy so I am not taking child bearing lightly. I understand how much parents especially mothers have to sacrifice for their babies but that doesn't mean I have the right to kill my children)",t2_bsuby5mk,1630608645,prolife

I'm pro-life but I don't fully support the new Texas bill,"Let me explain. 

You may be wondering, ""If you're pro-life then why are you against abortion being banned after the heartbeat?"" I'm not. In fact, I'd prefer abortion be outlawed from the moment of conception (though I don't think abortion will go away for good until it's made unnecessary, not just illegal). In short, the actual saving of unborn babies part is obviously not the problem I have. 

The problem I do have is the report system the bill has put in place. It's simply a dumb idea, to be honest. The idea of citizens reporting abortion clinics sounds good on paper, but the actual system is unfortunately not that simple. Instead, the law allows for people to report anyone involved in an abortion, whether it's the woman who procured it, the ""doctor"" who committed it...or literally the uber driver who drove her. That system is not only an overreach but it could also easily be misused. 

TL;DR, I support babies being saved from abortion but not the snitch system the new Texas bill has put in place.",t2_32pwc3bn,1630605173,prolife

Seriously Question: Why not look into vitality outside of the womb?,"Hi all, 

I want to start by being honest, and I hope despite my honesty that you all are willing to answer my question, because it's something that I've always been curious about. 

To start, I want to say that I do not support the pro-birth movement, but I am trying my best to be open and respectful of different beliefs. However, I want to clarify my own beliefs and the reason for my question first. 

As an American, who grew up with American values, I think it is insane for others to try to force their religious beliefs on others. I think the idea of forcing others to do anything based on an individual's personally held beliefs in un-American and un-democratic. I think that it is insane that an individual feels like that they have the right to tell another individual that they cannot take something out of their body, essentially taking away that's person's bodily autonomy; a right that a woman is forcibly being denied under any kind of pro-birth agenda (and this is my biggest gripe). The ""rights"" of a non-sentient being is given precedence over that of a sentient adult human being, in the pro-birth agenda which to me, quite frankly, is nonsensical. Finally, there is much evidence to support that abortions ban do not decrease abortion rates, but instead increases mortality rates of women. So the movement appears not only to be ineffective, but it's also contradictory. It does the exact thing that it claims that it is trying to avoid. And drags a process that should be above ground and regulated, underground and deregulates it.

That being stated, I am on this thread because I want to understand your thought processes. 

My biggest question is why do you all not focus on looking into vitality outside of the womb, instead of focusing on taking away, by law, what is technically a fundamental rights of any living female organism that is capable of giving birth? If this movement was truly about care, and concern for others, why go with the scorched earth method instead of finding a better way? You save what you believe is a human baby but what about lives of those involved? There is no secret that the child birthing process can be destructive to the bodies of women, and in some case, even deadly for women. Why try to force a person to go through a process that they don't want to go through, or that can be deadly to them instead of just finding another way? 

So I instead I propose looking into vitality outside the womb. Maybe artificially incubate the organism until it is fully developed and able to sustain life on its own? This way, the woman remains safe and the organism goes on to become a human child. I think that vitality outside of the womb could potentially be a great solution to the issue that you are all concerned about, and it may be more sustainable and less controversial.",t2_a8bvmhty,1630600117,prolife

THIS IS GOVERNMENT CONTROLLING WOMENS BODIES.,"Women have right to decide for themselves rather they an abortion or not. NOT THE GOVERNMENT, NOT MEN, NOT OTHER WOMEN. This decision is meant for 1 person and that is the woman who is pregnant.
Y'all don't understand how dangerous this is?
If women won't get a safe abortion, that won't stop her from getting underground abortions which will do more damage and higher death rate.
And no it's not because they're evil. The reason could be a variety of things to financial problems, to abuse problems or medical problem, etc.
Also none of y'all never talk about Child rape victims nor Child Pregnancy rapes.
And do not say that 
""it's a small percentage of pregnancy buy rape""
It's doesn't matter if the percentage is small, it could still happen and the that you use the excuse is insensitive and disrespectful towards Rape Survivers.
This is a story in South America.
A 9 year old girl could get her period, if she was raped by an family member she could get pregnant. Are y'all ok with a physically and mentally damaged 9 Year old girl giving birth where she would most likely die??

Thoughts on the new Texas anti-abortion law.,"Things I like: less kids will die, the mothers are not liable, there are exceptions for the life of the mother. 

Things I don't like: family members of the mother can be liable, frivolous lawsuits are incentivized, it's a vigilante law depending on untrained citizens to enforce it, there is no protection for kids before a fetal heartbeat can be detected. 

I am pro life and support Democrats For Life of America (DFLA)  but I don't think a woman who has experienced a miscarriage should have to deal with criminal charges, lawsuits, or investigations while they grieve and while the woman herself is protected from liability in this law there is still the prospect of her family being sued or investigated. 

For all those complaining about rights there is no such thing as an absolute right. All rights end at the harm of another person. When Roe v Wade was decided we didn't have the technology or scientific understanding that we do today. There is no way to deny that a baby in the womb is a living homo sapiens sapien just as we are. 

I appreciate the goal of the law to save lives but the legal ramifications of this kind of enforcement mechanism give me worries as does the aforementioned possible harassment of grieving families.",t2_sy5ph,1630567535,prolife

On fetuses and pain,"People are constantly saying that abortion doesn’t matter because fetuses can’t feel pain. But how much do we really know? Firstly, we can’t just hook up a fetus and start torturing it to see how it respond about interestingly it’s a fact that fetuses as young as 8 weeks a babies lips can be sensitive AND they can move around to make themselves comfortable. It’s also shown that later on they can sense danger. Reflexes are formed at 4-6 weeks so it makes some sense to assume that fetuses can feel discomfort or at least threatened at that stage. Most women find out they’re pregnant at 5-7 weeks. 

Here are some links on this topic:
(http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/fetalpain/AnandPainReport.pdf)
The shorter version (https://www.hli.org/resources/fetal-pain-reason-end-abortion/) 

Another point is saying that “they can’t feel pain it doesn’t matter” isn’t a logical answer because that applies to grown adults or children. The main issue and where people have been brainwashed in is thinking that fetuses aren’t human beings and that the magical birth canal gives you worth. That or they say experiences and then they realize born newborns don’t fit that category so then they either drop it or support killing young born infants. But anyways that’s my two cents",t2_ao3s2o1m,1630466607,prolife
"Question from a prochoicer: Are you only pro-“HUMAN life”? Or do you believe in a right to life for animals as well? If not, why not?","**This is not a “gotcha.”** I’m genuinely asking because I’ve never heard anyone ask a prolifer this question.  

I’m assuming most prolifers here aren’t vegan. But I could be wrong. My question is: Are you only pro-*“HUMAN* life”? Or do you believe animals also have a right to life?

If not, what quality do humans possess (specifically human fetuses) that would give a fetus a right to stay alive, but not a pig… or a chicken… or a dog? I could imagine a potential answer like “humans are more intelligent” — but why would intelligence be the bar for who gets to live and who doesn’t? Or maybe it’s that you believe humans have a soul — but how do we know that animals don’t? And even if they don’t, why does this disqualify them from a right to stay alive?

Why is a tragic existence better than non-existence?,"There was a disturbing front-page article in yesterday’s NY Times titled, “At Birth, She Already Had a Case File. At Age 7, She was Dead.” (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/nyregion/child-dead-foster-care.html?searchResultPosition=1) This child’s case file was created at birth because of concerns that her older siblings had been abused. We know that unplanned births are linked with child abuse and neglect. In families with two unplanned births, children are twice as likely to be victims of abuse versus families without an unplanned birth. In families with three or more unplanned births, the risk increases five-fold.

A friend of mine likes to joke that she never had a bad day in the formless void before she was embodied, only after. Why is non-existence worse than one of suffering and tragic death?

Babies, toddlers, and young children all can experience suffering. Yet we know for a fact that fertilized eggs, blastocysts, and fetuses don’t. We have multiple imaging technologies that let us watch in real-time how emotions and feelings (yes, they are different) activate specific parts of the brain not yet formed in a developing human. The development of the brain begins with the neural tube, formed in the first month of the embryo’s growth. The neural tube closes around week 6 or 7, at which point the brain separates into three parts: front brain, midbrain, and hindbrain. These three parts will eventually develop into the specialized parts of the brain, and the cerebrum will fold into the left and right halves. From the time the neural tube closes, around week 7, the brain will grow at a rate of 250,000 neurons per minute for the next 21 weeks.

The fetal brain stem is almost entirely developed by the end of the second trimester and during this phase the fetal brain begins to direct the compression of the chest muscles and movement of the diaphragm. These are like practice breaths and are controlled by the brain stem, which controls autonomic function, not reasoning. Sucking and swallowing begin around week 16, and by week 21, the fetus can swallow amniotic fluid.

The brainwaves that occur during sleep, controlled by the hypothalamus, begin occurring around week 28. The developing child will begin experiencing sleep cycles, including REM sleep, the stage where dreaming occurs. In the third trimester, the child’s brain will triple in size, growing from a little over 3 ounces to almost 11 ounces at birth.

The woman in the article clearly didn’t choose abortion, yet you would eliminate the option. Why is a life of suffering better than one pre-empted before consciousness?",t2_95x0ozgd,1630434437,prolife

"Unpacking a few arguments, needing some debate assistance.","I have recently engaged in a good-faith, understanding debate/discussion with who I believe to be a well-meaning pro-choicer.

Their main contention, like most, is that a woman should not be “forced to carry an unwanted embryo to term.” Interesting terminology, but we all understand why it’s easier to call it an embryo than a human or a child. They even acknowledge full well that the life has begun (at conception), but use a more self-defence-like argument to justify the act of abortion.

“I believe that during sex, you embrace the risks just as you would embrace the risks of many other activities, such as playing ball in the street or walking your dog in the park. There are things that can go wrong, the ball could damage someone else’s property, or your dog could attack someone. You didn’t necessarily consent to these actions, but that doesn’t abstain you from the consequences.

That is to say, I believe that once pregnant, you do not have the right to terminate the life of a child that is there by no choice of their own, but in fact as a result of your actions.”

I used this argument to try and close the gap between consent to pregnancy and consent to sex. Here is there reply which has me a little stumped.
  
“I see what you mean there. However, being liable for a certain circumstance doesn’t mean you’re subjected to a certain degree of punishment. For example, you can get in a car crash with another person and the other person may need a transplant of some kind (I prefer using an organ type argument where another person needs it to better fit a circumstance of pregnancy). Are you forced to give them what they need for the transplant? No and the government can’t just force you to even though you caused the crash. 

That is that I don’t believe being liable for something automatically subjects to have to do whatever is needed or that someone can force you to.”

Can anyone find holes in this line of reasoning?",t2_vd4ohq7,1630389084,prolife

I think the ultimate issue is values.,"Most of the time I'm debating a PCer I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. A brick wall that repeats itself and regurgitates bad arguments. I pondered why this was, why in the face of the most atrocious pictures, valid science and reasonable argumentation most, if not all, PCers held to a despicable position. And I think I know the answer. It's values. What do you value more? Human life? Or Absolute bodily autonomy?  If you value human's right to life more then you are or will be a PLer. If you value BA you are or will be a PCer. That's not to say both are equally valid viewpoints and are just different. Values can be wrong. But if the values that two opposing sides are starting from are so vastly different, it can be difficult to actually create a productive dialogue.

Abortions are never necessary. Even medically speaking.,"I think that people sometimes support abortion in extreme cases because they don't really understand how those extreme cases are taken care of and that they're not considered abortions. Even in most high-risk pregnancies there is usually no medical reason why the life of the baby must be killed with an abortion. These situations usually occur in mothers who develop dangerously high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, or other serious medical conditions. Some babies do need to be delivered before they can survive outside of the womb but its still a DELIVERY(preterm) *NOT* an ABORTION.  Emergency c-sections is an example of a safer (in that situation) pre-term devilery. C-sections take up to an hour and an abortion after 24 weeks takes 2-3 days to complete. because the treatment is then delayed, the increasing risk of death and disability rises for the mother. 

There are also times when women MUST go through certain medical treatments that may kill a baby that isn't an abortion. For example, a pregnant woman with cancer may suffer a miscarriage from chemo because the radiation killed the baby. This is NOT an abortion.

The last example is an eCoptic pregnancy. An eCoptic pregnancy is when the baby implants in the mother's Fallopian tubes or somewhere OUTSIDE of the uterus. Removing the baby is necessary as the baby will not live outside of the uterus, unfortunately the baby will die after being removed as-well, but those aren't considered to be abortions.

Bottom line is that abortions aren't medically necessary and a baby being removed from a woman and unfortunately dying isn't always considered an abortion. Efforts should be made to save the mother AND child is possible.",t2_ao3s2o1m,1630373355,prolife

Thoughts from an atheist prochoicer. This is not so much an “argument.” I’m just looking for your general thoughts/reactions.,"Growing up Christian, I honestly don’t remember thinking too deeply about the issue of abortion. If you asked me, I probably would’ve said I was pro-life but it’s not something that was regularly discussed. It wasn’t until I left the faith that I started thinking deeply about the issue. In a world devoid of a god, I came to think that actually humans are *not* imbued with a soul at conception. We aren’t these special higher beings with intrinsic value and intrinsic moral worth. We are valuable in the sense that we are valuable to *each other* and to *ourselves*. And without a god dictating our actions, we are responsible for how we choose to honor that value. 

So it’s up to us to design the kind of world we wish to live in. This isn’t going to be easy of course, and there will certainly be moments throughout history that we will look back on in disgust. But this is what morality is all about — it’s a global conversation, a messy ongoing dialogue between people of different beliefs, values, and interests.  
With all that being said, here’s my two cents in that global conversation: The world I think we should create is one in which we seek to **minimize suffering and harm.** Now you might be thinking, “Why should anyone listen to *you*? If morality is subjective, it’s just one man’s opinion against another’s, right?” Well… yes. These are just my opinions. Hitler’s idea of a Nazi regime was also just his opinion — one that I find sickening and vehemently disagree with. No one is obligated to listen to me. My aim is just to offer an account of morality that makes sense of our intuitions and that adequately explains how we typically think about ethics. Minimizing harm seems like a great place to start.

So how do we apply this theory of “minimizing harm” to the abortion debate? Well in the case of an unwanted pregnancy, we have two things to consider: the harm done to the woman and the fetus’ right to life. Given these competing priorities, typically it makes sense to say we should always prioritize one’s right to life. But doing so would actually *not* minimize suffering and harm in this case. This is because, in 99% of abortions, the fetus does not have the capacity to experience any harm. Meanwhile, if abortion is outlawed, women would experience physical and emotional suffering beyond what most of us can fully comprehend. So if our primary aim is to minimize harm, then the correct option is to permit abortion (at least up to the third trimester). 

“But what about coma patients who have a good chance of recovering? They can’t feel any pain either, so is it permissible to kill them too?” Well remember, I’m not arguing that we can kill anyone so long as they don’t feel pain. To the contrary, I think that killing coma patients would actually *increase* the harm done in society — not minimize it. This is because members of society would look at this act and rightfully fear for their own lives, wondering if they’ll be the next person killed against their wishes. This would lead to a distrust of medical institutions and ultimately to the breakdown of the social fabric, creating more harm.  
So there are some actions that may not cause immediate harm to the individual that we will still want to prohibit, purely due to the harms it will cause in the longterm by disrupting social cohesion. The same cannot be said of abortion, however. Abortion is currently legal and this has not disrupted the social fabric in a way that would lead to greater harm than if it were illegal. 

**TLDR: After leaving the faith, I concluded that morality is subjective. In my subjective opinion, I think the foundation of our morals should be to minimize suffering. Permitting abortion minimizes suffering.**",t2_qzcrm,1630258192,prolife

Pro-abortion argument (rebuttal): Unless you have adopted every child in the world you have no place to be pro-life.,"So this little nugget of a bad argument was recently tossed my way by a child, I say child despite their age due to the validity of their argument. Half-baked arguments and misinformed ideas are the hallmark of children but its often difficult to argue with them since they argue from a place for emotion and not from a place of reason and/or experience.

A very common and weak argument of someone who is pro-abortion is ""Unless you are willing to adopt all the children that are unwanted you are not allowed to be against abortion.""

This works off the false idea that you are responsible for everyone that you are looking to protect. This argument promotes the idea that unless you are willing to shoulder the responsibility of protecting someone fully to the point you need to take them into your home you are not allowed to speak on the subject. 

Obviously, this is a terrible argument on their part. For example, I am against child abuse - if a child is being beaten by their parents I am fully against that. However, using the previous argument unless I am willing to take that child from the abusive home and take care of them myself, then I am not allowed to be against child abuse and wanting to see the parents punished.

The idea that you must shoulder the responsibility of caring for someone when you do not approve of the abuse being done to them is a argument from emotion and doesn't hold up to any scrutiny.",t2_lxmbf,1630162509,prolife

Entitlement to care.,"I generally think the argument of right to life to needs to also be paired with entitlement to ordinary means of care. A parent has a duty to provide care to support the life of their offspring. This includes providing food, shelter, bathing, clothing, diaper changes, ect. Because not every stage in a child's life requires the same means of care. You will not need to change diapers, clothe them, bathe them all the time. Gestation would fall under ordinary means of care if legally recognized that life begins at conception. Because it would be care given to the parents offspring that all receive as a means to support that life.

By this argument, we are not making the statement that a child has a right to the mother's body but a right to ordinary means of care. People do not generally lose rights as they age and develop. That way we are also not saying the child must be gestated in the mother's body if technologrepercussionsy permitting the same we do not think the mother should breast feed since technology provides alternatives.

It would also have a specific legal frame work to adhere to. Since ordinary means of care are enforced by government mandate and the legal repercussions for neglecting these responsibilities without a transfer of caretakers is clear. As well as the  repercussions for taking actions against the life of their offspring. While also being careful not to tread on situations that fall into the extraordinary means of care. Such as situations where the life of the mother is at risk. Or even questions like ""should a parent be forced to donate a kidney to save their child""",t2_cpn2cpqb,1630119415,prolife

Abortion is murder?,"So I'm pro choice I just want you to hear my argument and tell if I'm wrong. 

I will begin with the statement ""life begins at conception"". As a statement of morality there is weight to this statement and I have no issue with people using this trying to build a world without abortion. There are situations I feel abortion is wrong.

My problem with that statement is ""life begins at conception"" is if it is used as a statement of legality. If that is a legal statement then we have to concluded 60+million American women are murders walking the streets.  If a mother hired a hitman to kill a three day old baby then we would love to see her in jail. The same would have to be true if she hired a hitman to kill a three day old fetus. This is something I can't stomach. I don't think the politics of the situation would let the Republicans say that publicly either. So should we build hundreds of new jails to send these women away for 25+ years? 

I think the statement ""women are victims too of abortion"" is misogynistic. I believe women know exactly what is happening with their bodies during the procedure. If 60+million women are so gullible to be complicit in a ""murder"" and not know about it should they have the right to vote?

"I discovered the post-modernist term 'anti-natalist' about a week ago and I have a serious question to ask them. If they are so convinced that bringing a child into the world is the most evil thing that they could do, why do they not just kill themselves to guarantee that they never have children?","I am 100% against abortion, the death penalty and suicide. I am only asking this because I find there to be a complete lack in the LoGiC of anti-natalists. 

Fine. You're bitter that you were born and had a rough life. To prevent the probability that you could bring life into this world, you have used BC, condoms, tubul ligations and vasectomies BUT there is still a chance that these methods fail, resulting in a pregnancy (Oh, the horror!)

The 100% guaranteed way is to commit suicide. Why do anti-natalists (who are, by their very nature, nihilists on steroids) not kill themselves to completely eliminate the risk of pregnancy?  Oh, wait! Anti-natalists want to have fun in life despite their horrible upbringing and actually committing suicide would require them to be gutsy and do something  themselves (ie, dying by their own hand) instead of letting someone do their dirty job for them (ie, delegating responsibility for their actions to a 3rd party.)

As long as anti-natalists choose to not guarantee that they will never have children, they should remain silent as they are obviously terribly selfish people for leaving the possibility - no matter how remote -  of being responsible for a pregnancy.",t2_3jn1z9em,1630049165,prolife
Food for thought,"I've been watching and reading The Handmaid's Tale and it's come to my attention that some people think it's a pro life statement. I don't see it as one or the other. If you think about the year the book was written, it was simply a prediction of how the author thought the near future might look. In the 80s, fertility rates were dropping, abortions were frowned upon by the vast majority, pollution had started to become an issue, and the world at large was still highly religious. A lot has changed, though fertility rates are still low. But now, this future is not something we see. Much of the world has no problem with abortion. Religious belief is no longer a priority to society. This is no longer relevant as a predicting story. However, I do see it as an advocate for women who have been the victims of rape, and their unborn children who are the innocent product of it.

Why do you think that human DNA = person?,"Full disclosure: I’m pro choice, but I’m not here to argue. When I do debates of PL/PC, I already grant that ZEF = person; I don’t need it for my argument. 

I’m just curious because this is something that bugs me which I can’t understand— why does something having human DNA suddenly make it “inherently valuable”?

To me, this doesn’t make sense for several reasons:

1. How can something have “inherent” value? If all humans died tomorrow, nothing would have value. That, and what kind of inherent value? Monetary? Sentimental?

2. How do you know something has human DNA? It sounds silly to ask, but surely you’ve never actually checked whether someone you considered a person actually *was* human. To me, that suggests DNA doesn’t actually matter; performative personhood does. 

3. How much human DNA do you need before you consider it human? Because, if you go far back enough in evolution, eventually the DNA will significantly differ from ours *even though they’re our ancestors*. So… are those not people anymore? Only *Homo Sapiens Sapiens*?

Orwell's Utilitarian,"""My take is that someone always has a say in whether they remain pregnant or not, it’s just that If the fetus is viable and the mother is healthy, terminating the pregnancy means we induce labor or do a scheduled c-section. Pregnancy over, fetus is born alive because it is capable of living without her.""

This is a torturing of the definition of abortion. If this was the case all live births (or at the very least c sections) would be classified as abortions and not just live births. Which would be confusing to a doctor if you said you want an abortion at 8 months. I doubt they are going to think you want to have the baby right then. Beyond that no one is talking about live births in the conversation. Absolutely no one. The PL side has zero problems with live births. They have a problem with intentionally ending the child's life.

""But no one is getting an abortion because their goal is to kill someone. They are getting them to end a pregnancy. I totally grasp that PL people do not think it is acceptable to terminate a pregnancy if that means the embryo dies, but it’s just entirely off base to say that the goal of abortion is to kill.""

This...is just wrong. On so many levels.... It ignores the fact that people get abortions to avoid raising a child, financial reasons, living conditions, genetic abnormalities, and other reasons. They absolutely understand that getting the abortion is ending their child's life and do it BECAUSE it ends their child's life. Not to end the pregnancy process in it of itself. Even if this was anywhere near remotely true all you are really saying is the ends justify the means by which you reach them. 

""Abortion would still exist if their were incubators capable of handling a six week embryo and gestating it for an adoptive couple or freezing it until an adoptive couple is found (though I guess if we treat these embryos the same as other embryos, destruction would still be allowed too). 

No one would say ‘well, I don’t want to terminate this pregnancy unless it means I get to kill it’ and this attitude that the intention of abortion is killing is a rather insulting misunderstanding.""

The conference will run from 9:30am up until 10pm with breaks (all East coast time) with a bunch of talks and workshops touching on human rights topics such as global perspectives on abortion, nuclear disarmament, assisted suicide and war, among others: a detailed schedule is available on the website here [https://www.rehumanizeintl.org/conference](https://www.rehumanizeintl.org/conference); and will be a mix of main talks, breakout sessions and networking.

Tickets are more or less pay what you feel and range in price from $5-$100 but all offer the same thing, and the organisers are keen to ensure nobody misses out on the conference if they're struggling financially and would otherwise have trouble attending; funding is available to those who need it. Rehumanize are also willing to help with accessibility needs and happy to take emails, the contact details for this are all on the website.
